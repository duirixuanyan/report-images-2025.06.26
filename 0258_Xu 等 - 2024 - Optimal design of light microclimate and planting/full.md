# ABSTRACT

Light has a significant impact on crop production. The objective of this study was to explore the optimal lighting structure parameters and the corresponding planting strategy of Chinese solar greenhouses (CSG). Taking CSG- grown melons as the experimental subject, we have developed a detailed 3D model capable of calculating the light interception at a single organ level, e.g., for individual leaves. The quantitative research was carried out after verifying the proposed model using field data. The results indicated that the reasonable ridge height for the most common  $9\mathrm{m}$  span CSG was  $4.9\mathrm{m}$  and the horizontal projection on rear roof was  $1.6\mathrm{m}$  in Shenyang area. In comparison with the experimental greenhouse, the optimized greenhouse improved crop light interception by  $0.5\%$  and increased the average air temperature by  $9.3\%$  during winter. The suitable planting strategy was E- W row orientation, with a ridge spacing of  $1.2\mathrm{m}$ , a row spacing of  $0.4\mathrm{m}$ , and a plant spacing of  $0.38\mathrm{m}$ . Compared with the N- S row orientation, the crop light interception increased by  $7.1\%$  and  $10.8\%$  in the two growing seasons, respectively. The model described herein can serve as a foundation for the production of CSG.

# 1. Introduction

Solar greenhouses play a pivotal role in facility agriculture, making a substantial contribution to human development [1]. As a modern energy- saving facility, Chinese solar greenhouses (CSGs) mitigate the challenges of cold climates and realize the annual supply- demand of fruits and vegetables [2]. Nevertheless, the construction of CSGs suffers from a lack of standardized guidelines, resulting in diverse Chinese solar greenhouses coexist in practice [3]. In order to maximize the utilization of solar energy, most CSGs are arranged in E- W orientation. Meanwhile, the conventional crop planting typically adopts N- S row, characterized by multiple short rows, which is not favorable for mechanized production [4]. Thus, it is imperative to develop uniform design and construction standards for CSG. Meeting the requirements for crop lighting and greenhouse heat storage is a prerequisite for optimizing greenhouse structures [5]. Additionally, the planting strategy of crops also affects the light interception of canopy and light distribution inside greenhouse [6].

The integration of simulation and empirical methodologies has significantly enhanced the optimization of structural parameters and orientation of circular arch greenhouses [7,8]. Notably, the structural complexity of CSG surpasses that of the circular arch greenhouse [9]. Comprehensive research into the impact of structural variations in CSGs on solar energy capture demonstrates a positive relationship between ridge height and solar energy received by the ground and wall [4]. Additionally, the horizontal distance from the CSG vertex to the wall, known as the horizontal projection on the rear roof, exhibits a strong association with the ridge height. These two parameters are pivotal in defining the shape of greenhouse lighting structure. The TRNSYS model, a widely- used simulation program for solar thermal systems [10], was employed to predict the light distribution within CSG. According to the

TRNSYS simulation results, the optimal design scheme for a CSG in Shenyang was  $20~\mathrm{m}$  in span,  $11.5\mathrm{m}$  in ridge height, and  $8.5\mathrm{m}$  in horizontal projection on rear roof [11]. Similarly, the light environment simulation model was employed to optimize the  $9\mathrm{m}$  span CSG structures at  $42^{\circ}\mathrm{N}$  latitude. The results revealed that the optimal ridge height was  $4.7 - 4.9\mathrm{m}$  and the horizontal projection on rear roof was  $1.4 - 1.6\mathrm{m}$  [12]. Previous studies effectively optimized CSG structures, however, the role of crop canopy within these models was almost overlooked [13- 16]. Detailed simulations of light distribution for individual leaves within canopies are scarce in literature [17,18]. Furthermore, only a few studies have considered the presence of plants in the simulation of CSG environment, which raised uncertainty about whether the optimized structures benefit the light environment at the canopy level [19].

In recent years, several studies have substantiated that the modifications in row orientation and planting density markedly enhanced the intensity of photosynthetic active radiation, as well as the growth and yield of crops [20,21]. However, identifying the appropriate planting strategy for CSG is challenging due to the long experimental period [22]. Functional- structural plant models (FSPMs) provide a potent approach to investigate the aforementioned problems by enabling the 3D reconstruction of crop architecture and the simulation of light interception [23- 25]. The study focused on tomato canopy light environment revealed that the light interception of middle and lower leaves reaches saturation at a row spacing of  $1.2\mathrm{m}$  [26]. Simulations also demonstrated that increasing the plant spacing has a significant impact on the amount of light intercepted by tomato canopies in CSG. While the plants arranged in E- W row orientation capture more light, the light uniformity was poor [27]. There are notable disparities in the canopy structure and planting strategies between tomato and melon plants in CSG. It remains unclear whether melons planted in E- W row orientation can intercept sufficient light. Specifically, there is a gap in literature regarding the optimization of greenhouse structural parameters and melon planting strategies that take detailed canopy structure into account.

To address these limitations, the present study aims to establish a detailed 3D simulation model, which is designed to combine greenhouse structures with melon canopies, and enable the quantitative calculation of light interception for every element in the virtual scene. Taking the widely used Liao- Shen type Chinese solar greenhouse (CSG- LS) as the research prototype, the light interception of the inner surface (ground, well, and roof) and crop canopies under different greenhouse lighting structures were systematically simulated. Significantly, in light of the insights gained from this study, we have retrofitted the experimental greenhouse structure. Through the comparison of actual environmental data, the viability of the methodologies proposed has been thoroughly substantiated. Further, the feasibility of replacing the traditional N- S row with the E- W row and the suitable planting strategy for melon were

The engineering innovations in this study are threefold.

(1) The calculation model of light interception for individual melon leaf under various CSG structures and planting strategies was established. 
(2) Taking the Shenyang area as an example, the optimal lighting structure of CSG was determined through model analysis. Based on the obtained results, the greenhouse structure has been renovated.

# 2. Material and methods

# 2.1. Experimental site and plant material

This study employed a typical CSG- LS as the research prototype (Fig. 1A). The greenhouse was located at Shenyang Agricultural University  $(41.8^{\circ}\mathrm{N}, 123.6^{\circ}\mathrm{E})$ . The corresponding parameters of CSG displayed a  $9\mathrm{m}$  span,  $4.5\mathrm{m}$  ridge height,  $2.9\mathrm{m}$  wall,  $1.6\mathrm{m}$  horizontal projection on rear roof and length of  $60\mathrm{m}$ , respectively. The orientation of the greenhouse was  $7^{\circ}$  south to west. The melon plants inside CSG were arranged in both E- W and N- S row orientation (planted on September 15th, 2021), with a planting density of 3.3 plants per square meter (Fig. 1C and D). The ridge spacing, row spacing and plant spacing were completely consistent, at  $1.2\mathrm{m}$ ,  $0.4\mathrm{m}$  and  $0.38\mathrm{m}$ , respectively. The melon variety used in the experiment was 'Hualei', and the daily greenhouse management was consistent with local farmers.

# 2.2. Experimental design and analysis

Using a combination of experimental methods and simulations, the 3D virtual model was established with the real- world parameters of

CSG- LS. Then, the model was verified by the measured field data, and further applied for the optimization of greenhouse light environment and planting strategy. The comprehensive research framework of this study was shown in Fig. 2.

To ascertain the appropriate lighting structure of CSG, the ridge height was increased from  $4.1\mathrm{m}$  to  $5.7\mathrm{m}$  with a gradient of  $0.2\mathrm{m}$ . Similarly, the horizontal projection on rear roof was extended from  $1.0\mathrm{m}$  to  $2.4\mathrm{m}$ , divided into 8 treatments. This process led to the examination of 72 CSG shapes, with the focus on evaluating the light interception of structural components (ground, wall and roof, Fig. 1B) and melon canopies inside greenhouse. The simulations were respectively conducted on both the winter and summer solstices. Nevertheless, it was recognized that the intense solar radiation during summer often necessitated the use of shading in CSG, making the winter solar radiation distribution more suitable for the purpose of model validation. To eliminate undesirable side effects caused by side walls and reduce the calculation time, the middle part of CSG was selected as the simulation area. The simulation area for planting melons was set to  $100\mathrm{m}^2$ , with a capacity of approximately 300 plants.

Based on the ascertained optimal structure of CSG, the planting strategy inside greenhouse was explored. As shown in Fig. 1C and D, the 3D virtual greenhouse models included the melon crops arranged in the two investigated row orientations. The specific parameters for each treatment were described in Table 1. The light distribution and cumulative light interception of crops was employed to evaluate the varied

treatments. To more accurately compare the applicability of different seasons and treatments for plant cultivation, melon plants were analyzed by dividing into three vertical levels as shown in Fig. 1B. The uppermost layer comprised leaves from the first to the ninth layer, the middle layer consisted of leaves from the tenth to the fifteenth layer, and the lower layer contained older leaves from layer sixteen to nineteen. As a result of the variation in leaf age, there was a difference in the utilization efficiency of light interception among leaves in different layers, which gradually decreased from top to bottom [28,29]. Consequently, the average light interception of leaves at different canopy heights during the photosynthetically active period (10:00 a.m.- 2:00 p.m.) was further compared.

# 2.3. Construction of the virtual greenhouse

The light simulation model for CSG was established on the 3D open- source software GroIMP, enabling the reconstruction and visualization of 3D virtual structures [30]. This comprehensive model encapsulated three constituent modules, arrayed hierarchically from innermost to outermost, comprising the 3D virtual plant module, the 3D virtual CSG module, and the solar radiation module. As shown in Fig. 1B, the cartesian coordinate system was constructed based on the contact point between the lighting roof and ground. There were two representative coordinate points A and B. Point A resided on the anterior section of the lighting roof, with its height established to comply with the operational requirements of the greenhouse managers. Point B was the vertex of CSG, where its vertical distance from the ground was defined as the ridge height, and the horizontal distance from the wall corresponded to the horizontal projection on rear roof. During the optimization process for the lighting structure, the coordinate position of point A remained fixed, while only the position of point B was altered, thereby preserving uniform shoulder height across varying CSG designs and improving space utilization. To improve the calculation efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy, the 3D greenhouse model used in this study has a length of  $30\mathrm{m}$ , and the general parameter properties for the model were shown in Table 2.

# 2.4. Construction of the virtual plant

The process of generating a virtual melon canopy can be divided into five main steps: image acquisition, digital processing, mesh generation, specification of leaf optical properties, and topology reconstruction (Fig. 3). The optical properties of melon leaves including reflection, transmission and absorption (Table 2) were measured by a CI- 710 (Miniature Leaf Spectrometer manufactured by CID- Bio- Science, USA measurement range between 400 and  $1000\mathrm{nm}$ , the accuracy of  $\pm 0.1\%$ , and integration time ranging from  $3.8\mathrm{ms}$  to  $10\mathrm{s}$ ). Subsequently, these obtained parameter values were mapped onto each geometric object by the Phong shaders for high- precision light interception calculation [31]. The melon canopy was fully defined based on the spatial distribution of the main stem, branches, petioles and leaves. The melon crops model was then imported into the virtual CSG model. As shown in Fig. 1, the 3D model of the melon canopies at the fruit set stage was constructed by the array in virtual CSG according to the given plant configuration (plant spacing, row spacing, row orientation). The detailed parameter values of leaves at different ranks were shown in Table 3. To authentically simulate the randomness typically observed in

# 2.5. Construction of solar radiation module

To establish an accurate light simulation model of crop canopies inside CSG, this paper employed a virtual sky hemisphere to simulate a diffuse light environment [32,33]. As shown in Fig. 3, the sky hemisphere consists of 6 concentric rings of varying radius, each containing 12 light sources (diffuse radiation). The daily sun path is a ring of 144 red spheres, each representing the position of the sun 10 min later (direct radiation). The sun moves clockwise around the ring, representing daytime when it is above the horizon and nighttime when it is below. The light ray emitted from the radiation source first penetrates the film at a predetermined transmittance before reaching the interior of CSG. Once inside, it undergoes a series of processes including reflection, transmission and absorption, eventually being intercepted by the canopy and structural components. The model factors in the dynamic nature of solar radiation intensity according to the sun's position and integrates local conditions of direct or diffuse lighting to gauge the canopy's light interception within the CSG at any given moment [34].

The total solar radiation (S) received at the earth's surface equals the product of the incident radiation outside the atmosphere  $(S_0)$  and the atmospheric transmittance  $(\tau_{a})$ . It can be calculated as follow:

$$
S = S_{0}\cdot \tau_{a}\cdot sin\beta \tag{1}
$$

After correcting the influence of eccentricity, the total solar radiation (S) can be written as follow:

$$
S = 1267\cdot \tau_{a}\cdot sin\beta \left(1 + 0.033\cos \left(2\pi \bullet \frac{(t_{d} - 10)}{365}\right)\right) \tag{3}
$$

where  $t_d$  is the number of days from January 1st, and the sine of the solar altitude angle  $(sin\beta)$  can be calculated as follow:

$$
S i n\beta = a + b\bullet \cos \left(2\pi \bullet \frac{t_{h} - 12}{24}\right) \tag{3}
$$

where  $t_h$  is the solar time,  $a$  represents the seasonal offset of the sun relative to the equator, and  $b$  stands for the seasonal correlation amplitude of the sine of solar elevation.

$$
a = sin\lambda sin\delta \tag{4}
$$

$$
b = cos\lambda cos\delta \tag{5}
$$

$$
sin\delta = -sin\left(\pi \bullet \frac{23.45}{180}\right)\bullet cos\left(2\pi \bullet \frac{t_d + 10}{365}\right) \tag{6}
$$

$$
cos\delta = \sqrt{1 - sin\delta\bullet sin\delta} \tag{7}
$$

where  $\lambda$  represents the latitude of the location of the solar greenhouse, and  $\delta$  is the angle of the sun relative to the equator. The number 23.45 represents the tilt of the earth's axis relative to the plane of its orbit around the sun. The daily length in hours  $(d)$  can be calculated by the factors a and b.

$$
d = 12\bullet \left[1 + \left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)\bullet \mathbf{a}\bullet \sin \left(\frac{a}{b}\right)\right] \tag{8}
$$

In the sky model, determining the exact position of the sun still requires the determination of the azimuth angle  $(\alpha_{s})$ , which can be calculated as follow:

$$
\alpha_{s} = \pm \alpha c r\sin \left[\frac{s i n\beta s i n\lambda - s i n\delta}{c o s\beta c o s\lambda}\right] \tag{9}
$$

The modelling platform GroiMP provided an integrated Monte Carlo- based ray- tracing method to calculate the light transmission, reflection and absorption throughout the scene [35]. The sky model could automatically update the internal lighting environment in the light scene at each simulation step, following the set time and date. Each object in the scene was labeled and defined as a radiation receiver, capable of detecting the number of light rays reaching its surface. To achieve the reproducible light distribution, the total number of light rays was set to 60 million and the number of reflections for per ray was set to 15. The calculation time steps were set as  $0.5\mathrm{h}$ , and the calculation period was from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Moreover, at each simulation interval, a radiation module instance is invoked to precisely assess the light capture by virtual sensor objects in the 3D scene.

# 2.6. Model validation method

The proposed solar radiation module has undergone verification within the application of greenhouse lighting simulation [19,31]. It should be noted that the previous validation was based on the crops planted in N- S row orientation. This study enhanced the validation by assessing the light interception of six melon plants in E- W row orientation during the winter solstice (Fig. 1D). The solar radiation intensity was measured using an MP- 200 handheld pyranometer manufactured by Apogee Instrument, Inc, Logan, UT, USA (measurement range between 0 and 1999 W m $^{- 2}$ , accuracy of  $\pm 5\%$ , and response time  $< 1$  ms). The

predicted value was obtained by placing virtual sensors  $(0.01\mathrm{m}\times$ $0.01\mathrm{m})$  at different positions in the established model, with a measurement time interval of  $0.5\mathrm{h}$  As shown in Fig. 1B, the measurement points were set at four canopy levels  $(0.1\mathrm{m},0.5\mathrm{m},1.0\mathrm{m},1.5\mathrm{m})$  and each level contained six sensors (divided equally in the southern and northern rows). Further, the average light intensity of measurement points in the south and north rows at each level was verified by group.

# 3.Results

# 3.1. Model validation

As shown in Fig. 4, the diurnal variation trend of the predicted values at different canopy heights were consistent with the actual measurements, and the predicted values slightly surpassed the measured values. Notably, the southern row exhibited a slightly higher light interception than the northern row. This difference was largely attributed to the omission of the greenhouse film's light transmission rate affected by dust particles during parameter configuration in the simulation model.

Moreover, the accuracy of the prediction and measurements was assessed using the root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) (Table 4). The results indicated that the RMSE values for various canopy heights ranged from  $7.660\mathrm{Wm}^{- 2}$  to 16.173  $\mathrm{Wm}^{- 2}$  , constituting approximately  $3.0\%$  and  $5.8\%$  of the average solar radiation intensity in the middle and upper layer of leaves in north row, respectively. The Pearson's correlation coefficients ranged from 0.927 to 0.954, demonstrating that the proposed model could accurately simulate the canopy light environment within CSG.

# 3.2. Optimization of greenhouse light environment based on winter solstice

The simulation of the light environment within CSG accounted for various greenhouse structures and the crop canopies. As shown in Fig. 5, the light environment of CSGs in winter solstice was analyzed. With the increase of the ridge height, the cumulative solar radiation intensity intercepted by the ground, roof and crops increased linearly. When the ridge height of greenhouse increased from  $4.1\mathrm{m}$  to  $5.7\mathrm{m}$  the cumulative solar radiation intensity on roof increased by  $242.7\%$  .However, the roof has a relatively weak heat storage coefficient of only  $0.29~\mathrm{W}$ $\mathrm{m}^{- 2}\mathrm{K}^{- 1}$  [12], and this increasement of solar radiation intensity contributed minimally to enhancing the CSG thermal environment. Additionally, there was a noted trend in the light intercepted by the wall, increasing and then diminishing as the ridge height increased, peaking at  $4.9\mathrm{m}$  .Furthermore, it can be found from Fig. 5B that with the

increase of ridge height, the corresponding quartile spacing decreased gradually. This indicated that increasing the ridge height beyond  $4.9\mathrm{m}$  would have a slight effect on the light interception of the wall.

As shown in Fig. 6, with the increase of horizontal projection on rear roof, the light interception of each component showed a downward trend. With an increase from  $1.0\mathrm{m}$  to  $2.4\mathrm{m}$ , the impact on the roof was still huge, while the light interception rate of ground, wall and crops decreased by  $2.5\%$ ,  $1.5\%$  and  $1.8\%$ , respectively. The box plot's upper limit, lower limit, median, and quartile spacing revealed a different trend in the light interception of the wall. When the length of horizontal projection on rear roof exceeded  $1.8\mathrm{m}$ , the upper limit, lower limit and quartile spacing increased significantly. Later, the quartile spacing with the length of horizontal projection on rear roof less than or equal to  $1.8\mathrm{m}$  was compared. When the horizontal projection on rear roof was  $1.6\mathrm{m}$ , the quartile spacing was the smallest, and the difference in light interception with the horizontal projection length of  $1.0\mathrm{m}$  was only  $0.2\%$ . The results indicated that the length of  $1.6\mathrm{m}$  for the horizontal projection on rear roof led to a relatively stable light interception for the wall.

# 3.3. Optimization of greenhouse light environment based on summer solstice

With the increase of solar altitude angle in summer, the intensity of solar radiation reaching CSG also increases. Correspondingly, the light interception of structural components and crops all showed an upward trend (Fig. 7). Increasing the ridge height of CSG from  $4.1\mathrm{m}$  to  $5.7\mathrm{m}$  resulted in an increase of light interception for the ground, wall, roof, and crops by  $3.8\%$ $23.8\%$ $8.0\%$  and  $3.6\%$  respectively.

As shown in Fig. 8, with the extension of horizontal projection on rear roof, the solar radiation intensity intercepted by the ground, wall and crops showed a downward trend. When the length of horizontal projection on rear roof increased from  $1.0\mathrm{m}$  to  $2.4\mathrm{m}$ , the light interception rate of ground, wall, roof and crops decreased by  $19.7\%$ ,  $72.5\%$ ,  $24.2\%$  and  $22.0\%$ , respectively.

This study quantified the shading impact of t horizontal projection on rear roof on crops by maintaining a constant ridge height of  $4.9\mathrm{m}$  and varying the horizontal projection length from  $1.0$  to  $2.4\mathrm{m}$  on the summer solstice. As shown in Fig. 9, when the horizontal projection on rear roof exceeded  $2.6\mathrm{m}$ , the daily intercepted solar radiation of the crops in the 21st and 22nd lines would be seriously blocked. Compared with the 20th line, the average light interception of crops in the 21st and 22nd lines decreased by  $11.7\%$  and  $46.3\%$ , respectively. Moreover, when the length of horizontal projection on rear roof increased to more than  $2.2\mathrm{m}$ , the daily intercepted solar radiation of the crops in the 21st and 22nd lines decreased sharply. Compared with the 20th line, the average light interception of crops in the 22nd line decreased by  $229.5\mathrm{W}$ , and the average light interception of per plant in the 22nd line was only  $16.1\mathrm{W}$ . Consequently, it was recommended that the maximum horizontal projection on rear roof should not exceed  $1.6\mathrm{m}$ .

# 3.4. Practical application and analysis

In recent years, there has been a surge in the popularity of upgrading

and renovating old greenhouses due to the cost- effectiveness and high- performance benefits. According to the obtained results, another CSG in Shenyang which has the same structure parameters with the experiment greenhouse was upgraded (Fig. 10A). As shown in Fig. 10B, the method of optimizing the greenhouse structure involved increasing the height based on its original framework, thereby altering its lighting structure. Fig. 10D demonstrated that increasing the ridge height has the potential to enhance the lighting of structural components and crops. During the winter solstice, the optimization of the greenhouse structures effectively enhanced the light environment of the crop canopies and increased the light interception by  $0.5\%$ . Similarly, on the summer solstice, the change of greenhouse structures has a great influence on the light interception of the wall, and the amount of light interception improved by  $3.6\%$  after optimization.

Additionally, the air temperature of the two greenhouses was measured around the winter solstice (from December 21st to 26th, 2022). As shown in Fig. 11, the optimized greenhouse structure effectively improved the thermal environment. Regarding the average air temperature, the optimized CSG demonstrated the  $1.37^{\circ}\text{C}$  increase compared to the original CSG, indicating an improvement rate of  $9.3\%$ .

# 3.5. Greenhouse planting strategy optimization

To investigate and optimize appropriate planting strategies for melon plants, a detailed analysis was conducted on four different treatments. It can be observed that the crops in the 1st line experienced a notably superior light interception during the winter- spring season. A notable discrepancy of  $20.2\%$  in daily intercepted solar radiation was recorded between crops in 1st and 2nd lines, attributed to the low solar altitude angles characteristic of the winter and spring periods (Fig. 12A). Compared with N- S row orientation, it showed that the proportion of crops with a higher daily light interception in E- W row orientation was significantly more. However, with the decrease in plant spacing, crops planted in the south row have a significant shading effect on crops in adjacent rows (Fig. 12C and D).

To compare the daylighting capacity of melon plants under different row orientation treatments, the average light interception of melon plants in the winter- spring season was quantitatively analyzed (Fig. 13). The results in Fig. 13A showed that the daily changing trend of light interception of crops in E- W row orientation was different from that of N- S row orientation, especially at 12:00 p.m. and 1:00 p.m. Specifically, the average light interception for E- W 1 surpassed that of N- S row by  $33.5\%$  and  $23.6\%$  at these times, respectively (Fig. 13A). As demonstrated in Fig. 13B, the cumulative difference between E- W 1 and N- S was  $7.1\%$ . Moreover, the cumulative light interception of N- S and E- W 3 was lower than the average value, and the difference was only  $1.1\%$ . This indicated that the optimum planting strategy in the winter- spring season was the E- W 1.

Fig. 14 showed the light distribution among melon plants in the autumn- winter season, which broadly aligned with the pattern observed in the winter- spring season, but with a reduced shading effect between adjacent rows. Compared with the light distribution of E- W 3, the uniformity of E- W 1 and E- W 2 had no obvious difference. To ascertain the preferable row orientation for the autumn- winter season, the hourly and daily light interception was assessed. The results showed that the lighting of the three treatments in the E- W row was higher than that in

the N- S row during the period from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. (Fig. 15A). According to Fig. 15B, the largest difference among the three E- W treatments was only  $0.6\%$ , while the difference between the E- W 1 and

N- W was  $10.8\%$ .

Additionally, the average intercepted solar radiation intensity by the three canopy layers in the winter- spring and autumn- winter seasons was

compared (Fig. 16). An observable trend was discerned whereby the average light interception by the upper layer initially increased before diminishing over time, irrespective of the treatment. Notably, the light interception of plants under the E- W row orientation was slightly higher than that under the N- S row orientation, while the difference among the E- W row treatments was insignificant (Fig. 16A- D). Contrastingly, the light interception trend within the middle canopy layer for the N- S orientation was reverse to that of the E- W orientation, characterized by an initial decrease followed by an increase as time progressed (Fig. 16B- E). For the lower layer of the canopy, the overall trend of different treatments was similar to that of the middle layer (Fig. 16C- F). These results indicated that the difference of light interception in crop canopies between the N- S and E- W row orientation was mainly affected by the leaves in the middle and lower layers. Given these findings, the suitable cultivation mode for melon was in E- W orientation, double row, ridge spacing  $1.2\mathrm{m}$ , row spacing  $0.4\mathrm{m}$  and plant spacing  $0.38\mathrm{m}$ .

# 4. Discussion

# 4.1. Novelty of the proposed methodology

Previous studies primarily focused on applying FSPM to field crops [36- 39]. Moreover, the simulations for optimizing CSG usually ignored the existence of crops [40]. In this study, we have innovatively integrated the FSPM with the 3D greenhouse sense, extending its application to optimize greenhouse structures. The significance of using a virtual 3D greenhouse model and virtual melon plants is to investigate the interaction between the structural parameters of a CSG and its internal crops. Our previous research has shown that the optimization of CSG orientation considering the existence of crops could result in an additional  $1.46\%$  light interception for canopies [19]. Building upon this foundation,

this paper comprehensively optimized the ridge height and horizontal projection on rear roof of CSG. Instead of focusing on the choice of greenhouse orientation, optimizing the lighting structure for greenhouse would offer more direct and valuable recommendations for the renovation of old greenhouses. This is also in line with the 'consolidated and contiguous advancement of old vegetable facility transformation and upgrading' requirement outlined in China's central No. 1 document of 2023 [41].

The simulation analysis for various CSG structures was selected on the winter solstice and summer solstice, which has the lowest and

highest solar altitude angle, respectively. Apart from the varying outdoor temperature environment, there were significant differences in solar radiation intensity and its proportion between these two solar terms in northern China. Moreover, the maximum interception of solar radiation on the winter solstice has been recognized as the main evaluation index to determine the optimal structure of CSG [42,43]. During the summer season, while the heat storage inside CSG was not a significant concern, the roof would have a strong shading effect on crops near the wall due to the changes of solar altitude angle. Finally, the optimal CSG lighting structure for annual production in Shenyang was

determined by combining the optimal structure parameters determined in two seasons.

# 4.2. Interaction between crop and greenhouse

Enhancing mechanized production within CSGs is a decisive step towards improving agrarian productivity. Currently, most of crops in CSG are planted in N- S orientation, while the cultivation of E- W orientation is still in the experimental research stage. The previous simulation studies have showed that the light absorption of N- S row orientation was better than that of E- W row orientation [20,44], which was different from the results in our study. This is due to these facilities being the full transparency of the glass greenhouse, the change of row orientation had little effect on light interception and photosynthesis of crops [21]. However, unlike the glass greenhouse, the CSG has only the lighting roof that permits light penetration. For CSG, transitioning from N- S row orientation to the E- W row orientation results in increasing the plant spacing and shortening the row spacing. It leads to a significant reduction in the shielding effect on crops in the southern row (Fig. 10; Fig. 12), thereby improving the canopy light distribution. Consequently, the improvement in lighting potentially boosts the photosynthesis and auxin of plants, which leads to the thicker stems and greater dry matter accumulation [27].

In this study, the modelling was concentrated on the melon canopies during the fruit set stage. At this developmental phase, the demand for light significantly increases, while concurrently, the canopies will cause a pronounced shading effect on the CSG structures. Moreover, human intervention limits the further increase in plant height after this stage [45]. In other stages, such as the flowering stage, the plant height and canopy coverage of crops are relatively low. As shown in Fig. 17, the shading of the greenhouse wall and ground by the melon canopy during the flowering stage (with 10 leaves and a plant height of  $1.0\mathrm{m}$ ) and fruit set stage (with 19 leaves and a plant height of  $1.8\mathrm{m}$ ) on the winter solstice was quantitatively analyzed. Given the orientation of CSG was  $7^{\circ}$  south to west, the shading effect of the canopy on greenhouse was minimal around  $1:00\mathrm{p.m}$ . The presence of canopy markedly enhanced the shading effect on CSG, with the average shading rate on ground during the fruit set stage reaching  $42.0\%$ , and that on wall reaching  $13.5\%$ . The shading effect of the canopy on CSG during the flowering stage was relatively minimal, particularly against the wall where the average shading rate was only about  $3.2\%$ . The shading effect of canopy on the ground and wall during the flowering stage was respectively  $9.4\%$  and  $10.3\%$  less than during the fruit set stage. This further substantiates the necessity of comprehensively considering the canopy structure when optimizing greenhouse design.

# 4.3. Limitations and future work

Here, the canopy architecture under various greenhouse structures was treated as the ideal plant model, with crop structural parameters remaining consistent due to modelling complexities. This simplification diverges from the actual production, and future research should address this limitation and focus on the rapid acquisition and reconstruction of canopy architecture. In fact, the greenhouse environment is a highly complex ecosystem where the growth of crops is comprehensively affected by light, temperature, water,  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  concentration and other environmental factors [46]. Further investigations can be improved by incorporating a broader range of parameters, such as differences in latitude, the transition from the static to dynamic plant model, with the aim of more accurately elucidating the interactions between greenhouse structure, planting strategies, plant phenotypes and microclimates.

By 2022, the area of Chinese solar greenhouse in China has exceeded 810,000 ha, among which old and inferior quality facilities still account for a large proportion [47]. Upgrading these old facilities is crucial to augment the modernization level of facility agriculture. From an economic standpoint, modifying the span or the wall height of CSG is a costly project, due to the semi- permanent nature of greenhouse structures. In contrast, modifying the lighting structure of the greenhouse is a comparatively cost- effective alternative. From the view of industrial scale and development potential, the construction of Chinese solar greenhouses in the future should adhere to the principles of not competing for land with staple crops and prioritizing ecology. It is necessary to make scientific use of Gobi Desert, and other areas for the development of facility agriculture, and actively carry out explorations in automation and intelligent technology for facility horticulture. In response to the issues of the limited length of traditional N- S row planting strategy in greenhouses, which results in inefficient field operations and hinders effective mechanization, a tailored E- W row planting strategy can be adopted according to local conditions. Currently, the feasibility of this strategy has been validated in the cultivation of tomatoes [48,49] and melons, yet further model exploration and field validation are needed for other greenhouse crops. Moreover, the models and methodologies presented in this study are expected to offer new ideas for the development of digital twin models for greenhouses, and to accelerate the innovation of science and technology in facility horticulture.

# 5.Conclusions

5. ConclusionsThe current study utilized 3D modeling technology to virtually reconstruct the CSG-LS structure, and calculate the light interception by melon canopy at the leaf level. Subsequently, the verified model was applied to determine the structural parameters of CSG and to assess the feasibility of the E-W row planting strategy. The following conclusions were drawn: taking the CSG with a span of  $9\mathrm{m}$  in Shenyang area as an example, the optimal structures of CSG after optimization were  $4.9\mathrm{m}$  ridge height and  $1.6\mathrm{m}$  horizontal projection on rear roof. Compared with the experimental greenhouse, the light and temperature environment inside the optimized CSG has been effectively improved. Based on the view that crops intercept more solar radiation, the E-W row orientation can replace the traditional N-S row orientation. Considering the mechanized production and labor intensity comprehensively, the recommended planting mode of melon plants was  $1.2\mathrm{m}$  ridge spacing,  $0.4\mathrm{m}$  row spacing and  $0.38\mathrm{m}$  plant spacing.
