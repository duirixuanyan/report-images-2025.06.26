Cucumber LiDAR Plant phenotype 3D light interception Modelling Solar greenhouse

# ABSTRACT

Accurate acquisition of the canopy structure is critical for calculating phenotypic traits and light interception, which contributes to a deeper understanding of the interaction mechanism between plants and the environment. The objective of the present study was to accurately obtain the phenotypic characteristics of greenhouse crop populations and to quantify canopy light interception. The terrestrial LiDAR scanning was used to capture the canopy structure of cucumber populations under two common planting strategies inside Chinese solar greenhouse. Furthermore, an integrated 3D model combining the greenhouse structure, canopy structure, and solar radiation was developed to compare the light environment difference between the LiDAR- derived canopy and the virtual canopy. The results indicated that terrestrial LiDAR scanning was an effective technique for obtaining accurate canopy structures, enabling the extraction of detailed phenotypic traits from plant canopies. Significant heterogeneity was observed both vertically and horizontally within cucumber canopy, cultivated in a north- south row orientation inside greenhouse. Using the virtual canopy constructed from measured organ geometry and angle, the maximum amount of light interception was underestimated by  $21.4\%$ , and the photosynthetic rate by  $14.8\%$ , compared to calculations using the LiDAR- derived canopy. In summary, using the 3D structure of virtual canopies cannot accurately quantify the actual light environment in Chinese solar greenhouse. The proposed methodology provides new insights on canopy heterogeneous analysis and light micro- climate simulation in Chinese solar greenhouse, offering a foundation for precise greenhouse management.

# 1. Introduction

Solar radiation is a crucial environmental parameter in greenhouse production. It not only facilitates the accumulation and transformation of crop dry matter but also serves as the primary heat source for greenhouses (Ge et al., 2023; Yu et al., 2023). The redistribution of solar radiation within crop populations induces microclimatic changes in the canopy, which subsequently affect crop growth, development, and yield formation (Wu et al., 2019). Conversely, the growth and development of individual crops contribute to heterogeneity in canopy structure (de Vries et al., 2017). Therefore, quantifying the relationship between high- throughput plant phenotype and canopy light interception holds significant importance for greenhouse production.

Traditional method for calculating canopy light interception involve measuring solar radiation intensity and applying the Lambert- Beer law (Monsi et al., 2005). However, this method cannot directly capture the light interception at the organ level (Cossu et al., 2014). With the rapid development of functional- structural plant models (FSPM), the light interception for individual leaf can be obtained through the integration of 3D plant model and radiation simulation (Guo and Li, 2001; Vos et al., 2007; Vos et al., 2010). The accuracy of this method is directly affected by the precision of the canopy structure representation (Sarlikioti et al.,

2011; Kim et al., 2020). Previous studies have commonly constructed unified virtual canopies by measuring the phenotypic traits of representative plants and employing random rotations to approximate real- world production scenarios (Zhang et al., 2020a). The light simulation difference between the virtual canopy and the real canopy scenarios remains unclear.

Common methods for reconstructing 3D canopy model include structure from motion (SFM) (Li et al., 2020a) and multi- view stereo (MVS)(Webster et al., 2018), RGB- D camera (Fu et al., 2020), 3D digitizing (Wang et al., 2019), and 3D laser scanning (Kang et al., 2023). These techniques are predominantly employed for 3D reconstruction at the scale of individual plant. Several studies have utilized the portable high- resolution 3D scanner to capture accurate canopy structure of crops in plastic greenhouse and Venito- type glasshouse, enabling the quantification of light interception and photosynthesis (Hwang et al., 2023; Kang et al., 2023). While this method can accurately capture individual organ structure, it is time- consuming and require specific crop cultivation patterns. In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with various remote sensors have been increasingly applied in agriculture for the 3D reconstruction of population canopies (Jiang et al., 2019; Xiao et al., 2023). However, due to spatial constraints and the dense canopies, this approach is not yet suitable for greenhouse production scenarios. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR), an active remote sensing technology, minimizes disturbances to canopy structures during data acquisition and offers promising potential for high- throughput phenotypic quantification of crop populations (Dian et al., 2023). It can rapidly provide essential structural data for light interception simulation of population canopies and has been extensively applied in forestry (Beland and Baldocchi, 2021; Bailey and Fu, 2022). Nonetheless, the application of these methods in the production scenarios of Chinese solar greenhouses remains to be explored.

The unique structure of Chinese solar greenhouse consists of one light- receiving side and three enclosed walls (Wu et al., 2023). These greenhouses efficiently utilize solar energy to meet the environmental requirements for crop growth during winter. However, the internal climate exhibits significant spatial variability, characterized by a gradient in light and temperature that decreases from south to north during the day (Zheng et al., 2020). At night, the pattern reverses, with higher air temperature observed near the north wall (Hou et al., 2021). Empirical study has shown that tomato plants in the northern section of Chinese solar greenhouse exhibit shade- avoidance responses, such as stem elongation and leaf expansion. Compared to plants in the central and southern sections, those in the northern display lower total biomass (Li et al., 2016). This heterogeneity in canopy phenotype is primarily driven by environmental gradients that influence crop growth. Currently, such heterogeneity is typically assessed through manual measurements. Accurate simulation of the light environment based on real canopy structure in Chinese solar greenhouse have not yet been reported.

This study focuses on cucumbers, a widely cultivated crop in Chinese solar greenhouses, employing LiDAR to reconstruct the 3D structure of crop populations and extract phenotypic traits, thereby enabling high- precision simulations of the light environment. The objectives of this study are (i) to propose a general framework of using terrestrial LiDAR within Chinese solar greenhouse for plant phenotypic traits analysis and light interception calculation, (ii) to highlight the importance of accurate canopy reconstruction by comparing the differences in application outcomes between LiDAR- derived and virtual canopy under two planting strategies, and (iii) to quantify the heterogeneity of cucumber canopies in the north- south direction within greenhouse.

# 2. Material and methods

# 2.1. Greenhouse and plant materials

The experiment was conducted at a typical Chinese solar greenhouse located in Beijing, China  $(39.49^{\circ}\mathrm{N},$ $116.21^{\circ}\mathrm{E})$  in 2023, with detailed structural parameters presented in Fig. 1a. The supporting structure of lighting roof consists of a steel skeleton covered with a transparent 0.15 mm polyolefin film, complemented by a quilt during the night time. The walls are constructed using  $240~\mathrm{mm}$  - thick fly ash bricks and  $50~\mathrm{mm}$  thick insulation boards on both sides. The roof is composed of a  $200~\mathrm{mm}$  thick layered wall featuring interior wood sheets and exterior styrofoam. Cucumbers (Cucumis sativus L.) were cultivated in soil, with seeding on January 16, 2023, and transplantation to the experimental greenhouse on February 7, 2023, at a density of 3.2 plots  $\mathrm{m^2}$  . The experiment was designed with two variety treatments, with the experimental plots located in the central part of greenhouse. Each treatment consisted of a total of six rows, surrounded by guard rows. The experimental varieties included Dutch cucumber' and 'Zhonghong  $26^{\circ}$  which were cultivated in single- row and double- row planting strategies, respectively, based on their growth characteristics (Table S1). Throughout the experimental, daily field management practices followed those of actual farmer production.

# 2.2. Field data acquisition and processing

The microclimate environment was monitored using QSO- S PAR sensors (Photosynthetically Active Radiation, Decagon, US) and RC- 4 temperature sensors (Elitech, China, Precision  $\pm 0.1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , temperature ranges from  $- 30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  to  $110^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ) at 10- minute intervals. TLS was employed to scan the target region at various vertex stations, with four calibration balls strategically placed for point cloud data registration. The SCENE 2019 software (FARO, Lake Mary, Florida, USA) was used to register the original point clouds. The specific arrangement of the sensors and LiDAR was illustrated in Fig. 1a. After collecting the 3D plant structure data, ten cucumber plants with similar morphology were selected for field measurements including plant height, internode length, leaf length, leaf width, leaf inclination angle, petiole angle and petiole length (Table S1). Moreover, the 2D orthographic images of the leaves were collected to evaluate the accuracy of the LiDAR- derived leaf area.

# 2.3. Reconstruction of the greenhouse production scenario

The point clouds of the cucumber canopy were segmented from the original data, which included plant, soil, and lines with x, y, z positions, as well as R, G, B color information (Fig. 2a), using CloudCompare software (https://www.cloudcompare.org/). Subsequently, preprocessing and manual segmentation were performed to separate individual leaf based on the point clouds. A reverse engineering software (Geo- magic Design X, 3D Systems) was used for hole filling, noise removal, and to generate a meshed leaf structure from the point clouds (Fig. 2d). A realistic representation of the leaf distribution for each cucumber plant was then achieved using this approach (Fig. 2e). The virtual canopy used in this study was established using GroIMP, an open- source modelling platform (Hemmerling et al., 2013). To better simulate the production environment, the orientation of each cucumber plant was randomly assigned a value between 0 and 360 degrees. To reduce computational load without compromising model accuracy, the greenhouse model established was  $15.0\mathrm{m}$  in length, while other structural parameters were consistent with the experimental greenhouse. Finally, the 3D greenhouse model was combined with the cucumber canopy model and radiation model to achieve a high- precision reconstruction of the greenhouse production scene (Fig. 2f- h).

# 2.4. Extraction of leaf phenotypic traits

Following the acquisition of canopy point cloud, individual leaf phenotypic traits, such as leaf area, leaf length, maximal leaf width, and leaf angle, can be extracted (Wei et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2024). Fig. 3a- c showed the field measurement process of leaf phenotypic traits, which were subsequently used for the reconstruction of the virtual canopy. The

where,  $LA$  stands for the individual leaf area  $(\mathbf{m}^2)$ ;  $Lw$  and  $Ll$  represent the leaf length and width  $(\mathbf{m})$ , respectively. The leaf area index  $(LAI)$  is estimated by summing the areas of each leaf derived from the triangle meshes:

$$
LAI = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}LAD(h_i)\bullet d_h = \frac{Total_{leafarea}}{S} \tag{2}
$$

where,  $LAD$  is the leaf area density  $(\mathbf{m}^2\mathbf{m}^{- 3})$ , which refers to the total area of plant leaves per unit volume;  $h_i$  refers to the canopy height  $(\mathbf{m})$  and  $S$  is the soil area  $(\mathbf{m}^2)$ .

The inclination and azimuth angles of the leaf are determined by normal vectors  $(\mathrm{Nx}, \mathrm{Ny}, \mathrm{Nz})$ , which can be directly calculated from the point clouds (Fig. 3c). Subsequently, the leaf inclination angle is calculated as follows:

$$
\beta = \cos^{-1}\frac{\stackrel{\rightharpoonup}{N}\times\stackrel{\rightharpoonup}{Z}}{\left|\stackrel{\rightharpoonup}{N}\right|\times\left|\stackrel{\rightharpoonup}{Z}\right|} \tag{3}
$$

where,  $\rightarrow_{\mathrm{N}}$  is the normal vector of the leaf,  $\rightarrow_{Z}$  stands for the zenith vector. The output value of leaf inclination  $(\beta)$  ranges from 0 and 90 degrees, and can be categorized into horizontal leaf  $(0^{\circ} - 30^{\circ})$ , inclined leaf  $(30^{\circ} - 60^{\circ})$  and vertical leaf  $(60^{\circ} - 90^{\circ})$ . The percentage of the number of leaves in each interval to the total number is seen as the distribution frequency.

Leaf azimuth is calculated from the selected feature points (Fig. 3c) by the following function:

$$
\alpha = \tan^{-1}\frac{\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2}{\mathbf{y}_1 - \mathbf{y}_2} \tag{4}
$$

$$
\alpha = \tan^{-1}\frac{\mathbf{x}_1 - \mathbf{x}_2}{\mathbf{y}_1 - \mathbf{y}_2} \tag{4}
$$

where,  $\alpha$  stands for the leaf azimuth angle, and  $\mathbf{x}$ ,  $\mathbf{y}$  are the Cartesian coordinates of leaf point cloud.

# 2.5. Calculation of canopy light interception and photosynthetic rate

Canopy light interception was calculated within the Helios 3D modeling framework (Bailey, 2019), integrating the 3D greenhouse and canopy structures with Bailey's radiation model. A reverse ray tracing method was employed to calculate light interception by both the cucumber canopy and greenhouse structures. The solar position was determined based on latitude, longitude, day of the year, and time of day. The simulation was performed from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00p.m. on 1st April 2023, synchronized with the date of the LiDAR data collection. This day corresponded to the 53rd day after cucumber transplantation, which aligns with the fruiting stage. At this time, the cucumber canopy structure has stabilized with 13 to 15 leaves, producing the most significant shading effect on the greenhouse structures. The output was the photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) within the radiation spectrum (400–700 nm) in Watt, which was then converted into Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD,  $\mu \mathrm{mol} \mathrm{m}^{- 2} \mathrm{s}^{- 1}$ ) through the conversion coefficient of 4.57 (Willockx et al., 2024) and leaf area  $(\mathbf{m}^2)$ . Canopy photosynthetic rates were determined with intercepted PPFD, calculated from ray tracing simulations and the modified Farquhar, von Caemmerer, and Berry (FvCB) model proposed by Zhang et al., 2021. The

method of modified FvCB model was presented as follow:

$$
\begin{array}{l}{P = \min \{A_c,A_j,A_p\} -R_d}\\ {}\\ {A_c = \frac{V_{cmax}(C_c - \Gamma_o)}{C_c + K_c\left(1 + \frac{o}{K_o}\right)}} \end{array} \tag{5}
$$

$$
A_{j} = \frac{J(C_{i} - \Gamma_{*})}{(4C_{i} + 8\Gamma_{*})} \tag{7}
$$

$$
\Theta J^2 -(I_2 + J_{max})J + I_2J_{max} = 0 \tag{8}
$$

$$
I_{2} = \frac{I(1 - f)(1 - \delta)}{2} \tag{9}
$$

$$
A_{p} = 3P_{u} \tag{10}

All variables and their definitions are detailed in Table S2. During the calculation process, leaf temperature and relative humidity were set based on the measurements from sensors positioned at various locations within the canopy.

# 2.6. The whole workflow

The canopy structure of the cucumber population under two common planting strategies within a Chinese solar greenhouse was reconstructed using terrestrial LiDAR scanning (TLS, FARO Focus, Lake Mary, Florida, USA, Fig. 1a). The multi- dimensional phenotypic traits were extracted to analyze the spatial characteristics of the canopy. The virtual canopy (VC) of cucumber was established based on the geometric structure and spatial layout of the organs measured in the field, and it served as a comparative benchmark to analyze the 3D canopy heterogeneity and light environment difference with LiDAR- derived canopy (LC). The steps involved, from the reconstruction of the plant structural model to the evaluation of 3D light interception within canopies, were illustrated in Figs. 1- 3. Finally, the heterogeneity and anisotropy in phenotype and light micro- climate in the north- south direction of the greenhouse were quantitatively analyzed at the population, individual plant and leaf scales.

# 2.7. Statistical analysis

The differences between observed and simulated data were assessed by comparing the coefficients of determination  $(\mathbb{R}^2)$ , root mean square error (RMSE), mean deviation (Bias), and relative root mean squared error (rRMSE):

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(y_i - \widehat{y_i})^2}{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y_i})^2} \tag{12}
$$

$$
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_i - y_i)^2} \tag{13}
$$

$$
Bias = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(x_{i} - y_{i}) \tag{14}
$$

$$
rRMSE = \frac{RMSE}{\bar{y_i}}\times 100\% \tag{15}
$$

where,  $n$  is the the total number of validation samples,  $y_{i}$  is the measured value,  $\widehat{y_i}$  is the predicted value, and  $\bar{y_i}$  is the mean value of the measured value.

# 3. Results

# 3.1. LiDAR-derived cucumber phenotypic traits

The leaf area derived from LiDAR was evaluated using measurements from 40 independent cucumber leaf samples and compared with results from a traditional empirical formula. Both methods exhibited strong agreement with measurement values, achieving  $\mathbb{R}^2$  values of 0.98 and 0.95, respectively (Fig. 4). The LiDAR- derived leaf area slightly exceeded the measured values obtained from 2D images, while the leaf area calculated by the empirical formula was lower than the measured values. The corresponding RMSE were  $34.67~\mathrm{cm}^2$  and  $26.46~\mathrm{cm}^2$  respectively.

The reconstructed 3D point clouds of the cucumber canopy provided realistic visualizations of the greenhouse production scenario, revealing heterogeneity in plant height among crop populations under two planting strategies (Fig. 5). The canopy structure also exhibited obvious differences among the two varieties. The average plant height of 'Zhong Nong  $26^{\circ}$  cultivar in double- row planting strategy was obviously higher than that of 'Dutch cucumber' cultivar in single- row planting strategy. Additionally, obvious differences in both leaf area and plant height were observed between the adjacent rows and within the same row under two planting strategies.

To avoid the edge effects, two adjacent rows (leaf and right) of plants in the middle of each planting strategy were selected for statistical analysis of leaf azimuth angle. The distribution frequency between  $0^{\circ}$  -  $270^{\circ}$  (S- W orientation) was relatively low, which fully demonstrated the phototropism of the plant (Fig. 5e- f). The difference in distribution frequency of leaf azimuth angle between the left and right rows was more obvious for the double- row planting strategy compared to the single- row planting strategy. This variation can be attributed to the distinct differences in row- spacing and furrow distance in the double- row planting strategy, and the leaves in both rows were mainly oriented towards the east- west distribution (Fig. 5f). The leaf inclination angle was categorized into three categories, as showed in Table 1, horizontal leaf  $(0^{\circ} - 30^{\circ})$ , inclined leaf  $(30^{\circ} - 60^{\circ})$  and vertical leaf  $(60^{\circ} - 90^{\circ})$ . Horizontal leaves were the most prevalent, followed by inclined leaves, with vertical leaves being the least common across both planting strategies. Moreover, the distribution frequency of inclined leaves was higher in the single- row planting strategy compared to the double- row

# 3.2. Quantification of light environment within cucumber canopy in greenhouse

The calculation period was set from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., aligning with the daily greenhouse management routine. The measured and simulated light interception exhibited strong agreements across different canopy heights (Fig. 6), with  $\mathbb{R}^2$  values ranging from 0.90 to 0.94 for various canopy layers. This indicated the high reliability of the light interception model constructed for the cucumber canopy within the greenhouse.

The difference in cumulative light interception between the LiDAR- derived canopy and virtual canopy under the two planting strategies was displayed in Fig. 7. As solar altitude increased, the hourly

cumulative PAR interception differences became more apparent (Fig. 7a). This difference was particularly noticeable in the single- row planting strategy, where there was less shading between adjacent rows. Fig. 7b highlighted that the traditional methods for constructing virtual canopy obviously underestimated both leaf area and the corresponding light interception. Specifically, for the single- row planting strategy, differences in leaf area and light interception can reached 19.7  $\%$  and  $18.4\%$  between LiDAR- derived and virtual canopy, respectively. For the double- row planting strategy, these differences were  $16.5\%$  and  $21.4\%$  respectively.

# 3.3. Necessity and economy evaluation of LiDAR-derived canopy for greenhouse structure optimization

The effect of different canopy structures on the greenhouse microclimate was quantitatively evaluated (Fig. 8a and 8b). The use of the virtual canopy tended to overestimate daylight interception and heat storage effects within greenhouse. Specifically, under the single- row planting strategy, the virtual canopy overestimated light interception by  $4.2\%$  and underestimated the ground shading rate by  $3.2\%$  compared to the LiDAR- derived canopy. For the double- row planting strategy, these overestimation and underestimation values were  $4.4\%$  and  $2.9\%$ , respectively. For the light interception and shading rate on greenhouse wall, the virtual canopy overestimated light interception by  $2.6\%$  and underestimated shading rate by  $2.5\%$  under the single- row

planting strategy compared to LiDAR- derived canopy. Similarly, under the double- row planting strategy, these values were  $1.0\%$  overestimation and  $0.9\%$  underestimation, respectively.

To further evaluate the importance and economic feasibility of optimizing greenhouse environments using LiDAR- derived canopy, a detailed analysis was conducted based on the commonly used double- row planting strategy. Compared to an empty greenhouse without crop canopies, the LiDAR- derived canopy provided  $33.5\%$  shading on the ground, while the virtual canopy provided slightly less at  $30.6\%$ . This  $2.9\%$  difference resulted in an overestimation of intercepted solar radiation by  $0.32\mathrm{MJ m^{- 2} d^{- 1}}$ . Similarly, the LiDAR- derived canopy and virtual canopy provided  $8.5\%$  and  $7.6\%$  shading on the wall, respectively. This  $0.9\%$  difference led to an overestimation of intercepted solar radiation by  $0.07\mathrm{MJ m^{- 2} d^{- 1}}$ . Based on the surface area of the ground and wall in the experimental greenhouse, the energy differences were calculated to be  $138.2\mathrm{MJ}$  and  $9.7\mathrm{MJ}$ , respectively. The total difference of  $147.9\mathrm{MJ}$  in solar radiation was crucial for accurately calculating the heating load required for greenhouse design and optimization. Referring to the study by Zhang et al., (2022), it was evident that using the virtual canopy as an input for energy balance calculations required the combustion of  $10.4\mathrm{kg}$  of coal to compensate for the energy deficit. This process would result in  $25.1\mathrm{kg}$  of  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  emissions. Alternatively, generating the same energy using a typical  $21\mathrm{kW}$  electric boiler would take approximately  $1.9\mathrm{h}$ , consuming about  $39.9\mathrm{kWh}$  of electricity with an estimated cost of  $3.3\mathrm{USD}$  per day. Given that China has the largest greenhouse area globally, considering the impact of actual canopy structure on greenhouse design is crucial for reducing production costs, conserving energy, and mitigating environmental impact.

# 3.4. Comparison of light interception and photosynthetic rate at individual leaf scale between LiDAR-derived and virtual canopy

The extended FvCB model was employed to estimate the photosynthetic rate at the individual leaf scale. The specific plants locate at the ends and middle of the inner rows were selected, with calculations conducted at 11:00 a.m., as shown in Fig. S1- 4. Significant differences in intercepted PAR were observed among various leaf ranks between LiDAR- derived and virtual canopy. Newly emerged vertical leaves at the canopy's top intercepted relatively lower PAR, while leaves in the middle of canopy layers typically intercepted higher light intensity. At the whole- plant scale, the maximum difference in intercepted PAR and photosynthetic rate achieved  $132.67\mu \mathrm{mol}\mathrm{m}^{- 2}\mathrm{s}^{- 1}$  and  $2.43\mu \mathrm{mol}\mathrm{m}^{- 2}$ $\mathrm{s}^{- 1}$ , respectively. These differences were most pronounced in the plant near the wall at left row under the single- row planting strategy, with the percentage difference accounting for  $19.5\%$  intercepted PAR and  $14.8\%$  photosynthetic rate, respectively. The photosynthetic rate distribution mirrored that of intercepted PAR, with higher rates observed in the middle and upper layers. However, the photosynthetic rate of the lower leaf ranks decreased due to the higher leaf age. The Bias in Table 2 showed that the virtual canopy tended to overestimate the average intercepted PAR. The RMSE and rRMSE indicated that the plant near the wall has the maximum difference between the virtual and LiDAR- derived canopy. This was associated with the intricate microclimate in the south section of greenhouse. The average rRMSE of intercepted PAR was approximately  $33.2\%$  and that of the photosynthetic rate was about  $12.3\%$ .

# 3.5. Heterogeneity of cucumber canopy in Chinese solar greenhouse

The canopy was directly categorized into south, middle, and north sections. Fig. 9 showed the vertical leaf area density (LAD) profile at different positions, estimated from LiDAR- derived leaf area. The obvious differences of LAD were observed among the two cucumber varieties, with the LAD of 'Dutch cucumber' being obviously higher than that of 'Zhong Nong 26'. The mean LAD was  $1.18\mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{m}^{- 3}$  for 'Dutch cucumber' and  $0.68\mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{m}^{- 3}$  for 'Zhong Nong 26'. For 'Dutch cucumber', the leaf distribution was relatively uniform from top to bottom. Conversely, 'Zhong Nong 26' displayed a greater concentration of leaves at the middle layers. Overall, the LAD at the middle section of greenhouse surpassed that of both the south and north sections.

The average hourly solar radiation intensity of cucumber canopy was highest in the south section, followed by the middle section, and lowest in the north section (Fig. 10). This result corresponded to the spatial heterogeneity of light distribution within greenhouse. The difference was more obvious under the double- row planting strategy, where the average light interception of the left (Fig. 10c) and right (Fig. 10d) rows at the south section was  $33.3\%$  and  $35.7\%$  higher than that at the north section, respectively. Furthermore, the canopy at each section was divided into three layers (upper, middle, bottom) in the vertical direction based on the average canopy height of each row. The changing trend of light interception was consistent with the average radiation intensity along the south- north direction of the different canopy layers. The middle layer of the canopy consistently intercepted the highest amount of radiation. Under the single- row planting strategy, the light interception at the middle and south sections of the left row differed from other treatments (Fig. 10a). This difference was attributed to the absence of crops in the middle section and the sparse of leaves at the bottom canopy in the south section. The above phenomenon can be visually observed in Fig. 5a.

# 4. Discussion

# 4.1. Application potential of LiDAR for phenotypic traits analysis in greenhouse

Plant phenotype plays a crucial role in genetics, botany, and agronomy(Li et al., 2020b). Accurate acquisition of plant phenotypic traits is essential for advancing agricultural research (Coupel- Ledru et al., 2019). However, obtaining these phenotypic traits inside the greenhouse is challenging due to space limitations and high planting densities (Guan et al., 2024). To overcome these limitations and enable non- destructive extraction of large- area plant phenotype, we employed the terrestrial LiDAR scanning to obtain 3D canopy coordinates by recording position, distance, and angle. Our findings revealed that LiDAR- derived phenotypic traits are highly reliable (Fig. 4). Notably, the

![](images/5b785a266b17845b85d5ec1d5a59ffc4480ebc7ff1ba9d7f6938bd5b6f0bc945.jpg)  
Fig.10.  t  t  t  t  t double-row planting strategy.

LiDAR- derived leaf area is higher than the measured values based on 2D images, owing to the precise representation of leaf curvature in point clouds. These results offer valuable insights into the relationship between plant phenotype and greenhouse environment.

Another notable advantage of LiDAR is the ability to synchronously capture canopy structures on a relatively large scale. It is well known that the plant canopy structure, particularly leaf angles, adjust in response to solar position (Kahlen et al., 2008). This phenomenon can be ascribed to the more efficient use of solar energy and named as the phototronism. LiDAR- derived coordinate data allows for rapid and precise quantification of such adjustments (Fig. 5e- f). In addition, the use of LiDAR effectively reduces the time consumed to measure phenotypic traits, mitigates errors caused by morphological changes during measurement, and enhances the accuracy of canopy structure acquisition. However, challenges remain, such as the absence of point clouds at the lower canopy. This can be rectified by adjusting the height of the LiDAR setup (Van der Zande et al., 2006), and utilizing point cloud processing software (Hui et al., 2018). These improvements highlight the potential of LiDAR technology to revolutionize greenhouse phenotype research.

# 4.2. The importance of using realistic 3D canopy to calculate light interception

Accurate canopy structure is essential for quantifying crop light interception. There is a significant interaction between canopy light interception and morphological structure (Kland and Baldocchi, 2021). A comparison of light interception between LiDAR- derived and virtual canopy under two common planting strategies revealed substantial differences:  $18.4\%$  for the single- row planting strategy and  $21.4\%$  for the double- row planting strategy. These disparities are noteworthy and cannot be ignored for precise greenhouse management. The light intensity exhibited a gradual downward trend in the north- south direction (Fig. 10), attributed to the unique structure of Chinese solar greenhouse, as also confirmed by previous studies (Zhang et al., 2020b). The canopy was divided into three sections for a quantitative analysis of light interception and leaf area density (LAD). The difference was more obvious under the double- row planting strategy. The average light interception of the left (Fig. 10c) and right (Fig. 10d) rows in the south section was  $33.3\%$  and  $35.7\%$  higher than those in the north section, respectively. Moreover, the LAD at the middle section of greenhouse surpassed that in both the south and north sections. The highest amount of radiation was often intercepted at the middle layer of the canopy. These findings hold significant practical values for optimizing environmental control and management within greenhouse, such as

supplementary lighting, reducing energy waste and enabling on- demand lighting adjustments (Li et al., 2019).

Several factors influence the light interception of cucumber canopy, including greenhouse structure, geographical latitude, plastic film selection, reflective film use, cultivation strategies, and so on. It is crucial to comprehensively evaluate and individually quantify these factors to better understand their impacts on light interception. In this study, we proposed a universal framework for accurately assessing light environments and analyzing crop population phenotypes under various greenhouse scenarios. This framework is independent of specific greenhouse structures, meteorological conditions, and cultivation methods, emphasizing accuracy and reproducibility. Specifically, the framework comprises independent sub- models for the greenhouse model, canopy model, and solar radiation which can be flexibly adjusted to accommodate changing production scenarios. For crops, phenotypic traits reflect various environmental factors, including light intensity, and simultaneously influence the surrounding environment, creating a complex interaction mechanism that is often difficult to quantify. Therefore, this study emphasizes the independence and universality of the LiDAR- derived method for analyzing greenhouse crop phenotypes and quantifying light environments. This approach not only addresses the specific challenges of the current research but also provides significant methodological support for future greenhouse management and light environment optimization.

# 4.3. Complexity of light microclimate inside Chinese solar greenhouse

Chinese solar greenhouse is a complex environmental system, where the greenhouse structure, crop canopy and microclimate as three interrelated subsystems (Xie et al., 2017). Solar radiation, serving as the energy source propelling solar greenhouse operation, profoundly influences greenhouse heat storage as well as crop growth and development (Liu et al., 2022). Unlike previous studies, we integrated the LiDAR- derived canopy with the 3D greenhouse and radiation model. By calculating 3D light interception within canopy, we quantitatively assessed the shading effect of cucumbers on the greenhouse heat accumulator, i.e., the ground and wall. The primary factor affecting greenhouse light heterogeneity is its unique structure, characterized by one light- receiving side and three enclosed walls, resulting in a gradual decrease in light intensity from south to north. Furthermore, the canopy can shade the greenhouse's ground and wall, further obstructing energy capture. To visually present the growth status of cucumber plants at different stages, we have included canopy point clouds of the seedling and flowering stages in the supplementary materials (Fig. S5). During the seedling stage, the canopy height is approximately  $0.3\mathrm{m}$  and remains below  $0.8\mathrm{m}$  during the flowering stage, with relatively low canopy coverage. Considering the distance between the southernmost plants and the wall, the shading effect on the wall at these stages is negligible. Consequently, this study focuses on quantifying the shading effect of cucumber canopies on greenhouse structures during the longest fruiting period. Under a double- row planting strategy, using the virtual canopy to calculate the solar energy intercepted by the greenhouse structures results in an error of  $147.9\mathrm{MJ}$  compared to LiDAR- derived canopy. This finding is significant for optimizing greenhouse environment and improving structural design.

Canopy heterogeneity is closely associated with the greenhouse microclimate. Although the span of Chinese solar greenhouse is shorter, the spatial difference of the microclimate in the north- south direction is more obvious than that in the east- west direction (Cao et al., 2019). Observations of cucumber canopy growth within greenhouse revealed that plant height and overall crop growth are comparatively weaker in the south section, particularly during the seedling stage (Fig. S5), as also reflected in Fig. 5. Moreover, the LAD of canopy bottom in south section is significantly lower than that in middle and north section (Fig. 9). Field measurements indicated that this difference is partly caused by the heterogeneity of canopy temperature (Fig. S6). Despite better light condition in the southern section, it is far away from the heat storage wall. Due to the limited heat transfer and heat convection, the nocturnal temperature is low, which may constrain crop growth.

# 4.4. Limitations and future work

This study quantitatively analyzed the heterogeneity of phenotype and light distribution within cucumber canopy inside greenhouse. The spatial distribution of temperature was obtained through field measurements using sensors. Future research will focus on analyzing the light- temperature coupling heterogeneity at leaf scale. Moreover, this method can be generalized and applied to the quantitative analysis of various crops, extending beyond greenhouse scenarios and cucumber crops. With the rapid advancements in technology and the growing availability of plant phenotyping, the application of digital twins has emerged as a promising trend in greenhouse production (Ariesen- verschuur et al., 2022). Digital twins enable growers to enhance control capabilities by taking immediate actions in response to deviations and simulating interventions based on real- life data (Pylianidis et al., 2021). An effective method involves the use of functional- structural plant model (FSPM), which predict crop responses to environmental factors and management practices (Li et al., 2021). However, the 3D crop model used in FSPM typically rely on virtual canopy. In this study, the use of LiDAR- derived canopy for simulating the greenhosue light environment may provide new insights to enhance the accuracy of digital twin systems.

# 5. Conclusion

An integrated method was proposed to analyze canopy heterogeneous and achieve high- precision simulation of light environment within Chinese solar greenhouse. The main findings were summarized as follows:

1. The difference of light interception and photosynthesis were influenced by canopy structure and the spatial location of cucumber plants. 
2. The maximum difference in light interception reached  $21.4\%$  between the LiDAR-derived and virtual canopy under double-row planting strategy, highlighting the insufficient of virtual canopy for accurately evaluating the light environment within Chinese solar greenhouse. 
3. The LiDAR-derived canopy offers new insights into phenotypic trait analysis and microclimate simulation, with potential applications in advancing crop breeding, greenhouse precise management and digital twin systems.

This study provides a general framework for the precise evaluation of light environment and canopy heterogeneity in solar greenhouses, serving as foundational research to advance smart horticulture.
