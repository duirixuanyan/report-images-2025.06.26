# Development Configuration

This document covers the development setup and configuration for the GreenLightModel repository, including version control configuration and project structure conventions. For information about system dependencies and environment setup, see [Dependencies and Environment Setup](/greenpeer/GreenLightModel/6.1-dependencies-and-environment-setup).

## Version Control Configuration

The repository uses Git for version control with a minimal `.gitignore` configuration that excludes common Python and system artifacts.

### Ignored Files and Patterns

The version control system is configured to ignore the following file types and patterns:

| Pattern | Purpose | File Types |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.DS_Store` | macOS system files | System metadata |
| `__pycache__/` | Python bytecode cache | Directory |
| `*.pyc` | Compiled Python files | Bytecode |
| `*.pyo` | Optimized Python files | Bytecode |
| `*.pyd` | Python dynamic libraries | Extensions |

The `.gitignore` configuration focuses on Python-specific artifacts and common development environment files, reflecting the hybrid Python-MATLAB nature of the system.

## Project Structure Overview

The GreenLightModel repository follows a hybrid architecture that bridges Python and MATLAB components. The project structure reflects this design with clear separation between interface layers and core functionality.

## Development Workflow Patterns

The development configuration supports a structured workflow that manages the complexity of the hybrid Python-MATLAB system.

## Code Organization Principles

### File Naming and Structure Conventions

The project follows specific conventions for organizing code across the Python-MATLAB boundary:

| Component Type | Naming Pattern | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python Interfaces | `*_model.py` | Main class definitions |
| Execution Scripts | `main.py` | Entry points and examples |
| MATLAB Extensions | CamelCase functions | GreenLight integration |
| Configuration Files | Lowercase with extensions | System setup |

### Import and Path Management

The development configuration assumes that MATLAB components are managed through the Python interface, with the `GreenLightModel` class handling path configuration and engine management dynamically during runtime.

### Version Control Best Practices

The minimal `.gitignore` configuration requires developers to be conscious of what artifacts they commit:

* **Tracked**: Source code, configuration files, documentation
* **Ignored**: Compiled bytecode, system files, cache directories
* **Manual Review**: Large data files, temporary outputs, personal configurations

## Development Environment Considerations

### Multi-Language Development

The hybrid nature of the system requires special consideration during development:

1. **Python Development**: Standard Python development practices apply, with bytecode automatically ignored
2. **MATLAB Integration**: MATLAB files are tracked in version control but executed through the Python interface
3. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The `.gitignore` includes macOS-specific exclusions (`.DS_Store`) indicating multi-platform development support

### Dependency Management

While specific dependency configuration is covered in [Dependencies and Environment Setup](/greenpeer/GreenLightModel/6.1-dependencies-and-environment-setup), the development configuration supports:

* Python package management through standard tools
* MATLAB Engine API integration
* Scientific computing library compatibility
