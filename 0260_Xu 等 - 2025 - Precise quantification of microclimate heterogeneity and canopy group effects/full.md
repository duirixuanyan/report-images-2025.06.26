# Abstract

Winter is a critical period for greenhouse crops production. Multi- source sensors were utilized to quantitatively describe the microclimate distribution patterns and the interactions between crops and greenhouse environment during the winter season. By integrating 3D simulation model, we calculated the energy balance of solar greenhouses, thus assessing the suitability and economic efficiency of several common greenhouse heating devices. The results revealed significant discrepancy in energy demand across different planting areas within the greenhouse, especially in the north- south direction. Significant interactions between crops and greenhouse environment were observed. The presence of cucumber canopies significantly increased relative humidity by  $3.0\%$  to  $3.8\%$  and negatively impacted air temperature by  $1.1^{\circ}C$  to  $2.5^{\circ}C$ . Considering the energy balance, initial investment in heating devices, usage period, and utilization effectiveness, the light tube radiators were identified as a suitable heating option. Compared to the unheated greenhouse, the heated greenhouse raised minimum temperatures by  $5.2^{\circ}C$  to  $10.2^{\circ}C$ , reduced maximum relative humidity by  $4.2\%$  to  $14.6\%$ , and had a return- on- investment period of approximately 4.7 years. These findings offer valuable insights for multi- source sensor deployment, distributed control, structure optimization, and heating design in solar greenhouse.

# 1 Introduction

Solar greenhouses integrate environmental, agricultural, and biological engineering aspects, playing a crucial role in off- season vegetable production. By leveraging modern agricultural engineering and mechanical technologies, greenhouses can largely overcome the limitations imposed by natural climate conditions. This is particularly significant in addressing the challenge of winter vegetable supply in northern China and similar regions with comparable climates (Tong et al. 2013). As a typical energy- saving gardening facility, Chinese solar greenhouse (CSG) effectively captures solar radiation, which promotes photosynthesis and convert solar energy into heat stored in the walls and soil of the greenhouse. This stored energy is gradually released in response to temperature variations within the greenhouse, meeting the basic temperature requirements for crop growth.

The greenhouse microclimate, particularly temperature, humidity, and radiation, plays a crucial role in ensuring optimal conditions for crop growth, high yields, and maintaining the required quality standards. Influenced by external meteorological conditions and crop type, the microclimate distribution in CSG exhibits spatial heterogeneity (Hou et al. 2021). This, in turn, leads to uneven crop growth, posing challenges for precise greenhouse management (Ma et al. 2019; Zheng et al. 2020). Simulation models can quantitatively describe the variation patterns of greenhouse climate parameters, serving as powerful tools for optimizing and regulating greenhouse environments (Choab et al. 2019;

Bournet and Rojano (2022). However, researchers often overlook the presence of crops and focus solely on empty greenhouses in simulation modelling (Tong et al. 2018; Kim et al. 2021; He et al. 2023). In recent years, some researchers have treated crops as stable porous medium structures (Liu et al. 2021; Fatnassi et al. 2023; Wu et al. 2023), while overlooks the interactions between crops and their environment, affecting the accuracy of simulation results (Zhang et al. 2020). Quantifying the influence of crops on greenhouse microclimate can provide boundary conditions for precise simulation techniques. Moreover, most experimental studies have primarily focused on individual parameters such as temperature or light, with few quantifying microclimate while considering multiple environmental factors. There is also a lack of continuous analysis across three- dimensional (3D) spatial and temporal scales (Zhao et al. 2023).

With global climate change, extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, and short- term low- temperature stress can cause permanent damage to crops, potentially leading to total crop failure (Kaige and Fongsheng 2007). CSG primarily rely on solar energy and the heat retention of their enclosing structures to survive winter. However, due to factors such as outdoor low temperatures and greenhouse design, certain greenhouses cannot maintain the required temperatures for crop growth at night, preventing crops from reaching optimal growth conditions. Therefore, it is essential to equip these greenhouses with heating systems to enhance their resilience against extreme weather events (Cao et al. 2019). Early greenhouse heating methods primarily involved burning fossil fuels, which are highly detrimental to the environment. To reduce the consumption of non- renewable energy sources, extensive research has been conducted on various thermal storage components (Chen et al. 2018). Specific methods included phase change thermal storage heating (Berroug et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2019), soil thermal storage heating (Zhang et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2023), active solar heating systems

(Ghasemi Mobtaker et al. 2016; Hassanien et al. 2016; Lu et al. 2017), passive water circulation thermal storage devices, and ground- source heat pumps (Xu et al. 2020; Arbaoui et al. 2023; Xia et al. 2023). Significant efforts have also been made to optimize greenhouse structures to maximize solar energy capture (El- Maghlany et al. 2015; Esmaeli and Roshandel 2020; Mellalou et al. 2021; Badji et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2022b). However, these studies often overly rely on solar energy, which can lead to cold damage during extended periods of weak solar radiation. To meet the production needs of thermophilic solanaceous vegetables, electric heating technology has been widely adopted in solar greenhouses in north China (Du et al. 2012). Electric heating and energy storage technology align with China's emission reduction goals and the need for peak shaving and valley filling in electricity usage. Moreover, this technology is highly effective in controlling the greenhouse climate efficiently. Nevertheless, there is often a mismatch between heat generation and thermal load, resulting in either energy shortages or wastage. As awareness of environmental protection and energy conservation, economically and wisely determining the thermal load of greenhouses has once again become a focal point for engineers and greenhouse producers (Sun et al. 2022).

Based on the existing literature, several conclusions can be drawn:

(1) The optimization of the light and thermal environment within greenhouses has received extensive attention, whereas the quantification of the 3D spatiotemporal heterogeneity of the microclimate remains scarce in literature. 
(2) The interaction mechanisms between crops and the greenhouse microclimate require further analysis.

(3) In northern China, the matching of greenhouse heating energy supply and demand in winter needs further quantification.

To address the aforementioned issues, the environment of four greenhouses was continuously monitored at multiple points throughout the entire growing period in Beijing, to assess the spatial and temporal variations of major environmental parameters. This study aims to characterize the distribution of the microclimate within the greenhouse and quantify the interactions between the environment and crops through cultivation experiments. The effectiveness and economic viability of active heating equipment were evaluated using experimental data, 3D simulations, and mathematical models to meet the need for supplementary heating in northern solar greenhouses during winter. This study provides fundamental knowledge and data accumulation to optimize the accuracy of simulation models and guide the accurate control of greenhouse environment.

# 2 Materials and methods

# 2.1 Experimental set-up

# 2.1.1 Greenhouse

The experimental greenhouses were located in Beijing BaiWang Plantation and Chaolai Agricultural Park, respectively. Beijing, the capital of China, is situated in the north of China  $(39^{\circ}54'20"$  N,  $116^{\circ}25'29"$  E), where has low temperatures in winter. The extreme annual minimum temperatures typically range from  $- 14^{\circ}C$  to  $- 20^{\circ}C$ , while the extreme maximum temperatures usually range between  $35^{\circ}C$  and  $40^{\circ}C$ . The typical frost- free period is between 180 and 200 days each year. As shown in Figure 1, the selected

Fig. 1 The schematic of experimental Chinese solar greenhouse located in Beijing: (A) column radiator; (B) tubular radiator; (C) distributed tubular radiator; (D) without heating device

greenhouses were the typical Chinese solar greenhouse, with specific structures comprising wall, roof, side walls and lighting roof. The detailed structural parameters were summarized in Table 3. The cultivation experiment lasted from October 2023 to February 2024. During this period, Cucumbers (Cucumis sativus L.) were planted in the greenhouses at a density of 3.2 plant  $\mathrm{m}^{- 2}$ , and the variety was Zhong Nong 12. After October 20 2023, the greenhouse quilt was deployed, with it being closed before  $4:00\mathrm{p.m}$  and opened after  $9:00\mathrm{a.m}$ . The daily management of greenhouse was similar from actual farmer production.

# 2.1.2 Heating system

The detailed parameters of each heating system were shown in Table 1. One system was the distributed electric heating system and the other was ground- source heat pump system. The distributed electric heating system included two forms of heating: radiators and pipes. Moreover, the Chinese solar greenhouse (CSG) without the heating system was used as the contrast treatment. The primary components of the heating equipment included an electric boiler, heat medium, water supply pipelines, radiators, return water pipelines, and water pumps. The main function of the system was to utilize the boiler to convey hot water through the pipes to the greenhouse's radiators, thus heating the interior of the greenhouse.

# 2.2 Field measurements

# 2.2.1 Multi-source data acquisition

The indoor microclimate data was obtained by the self- developed integrated sensors, which measured solar radiation intensity, temperature and relative humidity. The individual multi- source sensors were sourced from Jianda Renke (Shandong Jianda Renke Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., China). The temperature and humidity sensors were integrated into a single module to form a composite sensor. A multi- layer fixed bracket, designed and fabricated based on the cucumber canopy height in the greenhouse, supported the sensors. The temperature and humidity sensors were mounted beneath the solar radiation sensors to prevent direct exposure to sunlight. All sensor devices were connected to a data transmission unit via RS485 communication cables, enabling remote transmission of environmental parameters to the IoT data monitoring platform for continuous data collection. Outdoor environmental data were recorded by a traditional weather station. All sensors were calibrated by the JianDa RenKe prior to delivery. The recording interval was 10 minutes. To ensure data accuracy, all radiation sensors and temperature- humidity coupling sensors were placed in a unified greenhouse area for continuous data collection. The discrepancies in the data obtained from these sensors were compared with the instrument's specified accuracy range. Once the precision met the required standards, the sensors were installed for microclimate monitoring at various locations within the greenhouse. The details and characteristics of the sensors used for multi- source data monitoring in the greenhouse were provided in Table S1, which is available in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM) of the online version of this paper. The canopy structure of cucumbers was obtained by the high- resolution portable terrestrial scanning LiDAR (FARO Focus, LakeMary, Florida, USA). Moreover, the cucumber yield and sold price were collected after each harvest. The water supply and return temperature were automatically recorded by the heating devices (JIA SHI FU, Beijing Hesheng Sunshine Technology Development Co., Ltd., China).

# 2.2.2 Arrangement of measuring sensors

To monitor the microclimate inside the cucumber canopy, nine equidistant positions were equidistantly selected inside greenhouse. At each position, the three integrated sensors were arranged with equal spacing of  $0.5\mathrm{m}$  in the vertical direction (Figure 1). The temperature and humidity sensors were strategically placed throughout various structural components of the greenhouse, including the lighting roof, roof, wall, ground, and two side walls (33 sensors in total). The meteorological station was placed in an unobstructed position in the east of greenhouse.

# 2.3 Mathematical modelling

# 2.3.1 Heat load calculation

As shown in Figure 2, the greenhouse undergoes continuous heat exchange with the external environment through radiation, conduction, and convection, which alters its internal thermal conditions. By studying the thermal performance of various enclosure structures and calculating the total heat loss of the greenhouse, we can determine the heating thermal load of the solar greenhouse under extreme environment conditions, in accordance with greenhouse

heating design standards. The detailed calculation formulas were listed in Table 2.

# 2.3.2 Greenhouse geometry model and boundary condition

The geometry of CSG was established by using the

SolidWorks according to the real- world measurement parameters. As shown in Figure 3, the numerical analysis grid was designed by Mesh, with the number of cells ranging from 3,800,000 to 4,400,000 for different greenhouses. The dynamic change of microclimate over time was simulated

The boundary conditions mainly involved the building envelopes of CSG, including the physical property parameters of each material (size, density, specific heat capacity, heat conductivity coefficient, optical characteristic, etc.) and the initial surface temperature (Table 3). The discrete formats of pressure, density, momentum and energy were set to the second- order upwind schemes, with the detailed values provided in Wu et al. (2023).

The finite volume method was employed using CAE solution software to solve the equations. The momentum and turbulence equations adopted the second- order upwind discrete scheme. The implicit pressure link equation method was applied to couple the pressure and velocity.

the residuals for the continuity equation, the  $k$  equation, and the epsilon equation were  $10^{- 1}$  Courant et al. 1928). The grid independence of the four greenhouse models was verified by monitoring and checking the average greenhouse air temperature, which stabilized at a constant value. As shown in Figure 4, the initial number of elements was about 800,000, and after 9 steps of mesh refinement, it reached 6,200,000. The average greenhouse air temperature of G14, G15 G17 and CK demonstrated satisfactory accuracy at the sixth layer grid refinement (about 4,400,000 grids).Due to the lack of the grid effect of the heating device, this option was refined in the fifth layer (about 3,800,000 grids).

Richardson extrapolation was employed to extrapolate the results of infinite elements Roache 1998), and the error of each result was compared with it (Figure S1 in the Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM) in the online version of this article). The results showed that the error of the seventh grid of G14,G15 and CK ranged from  $1.55\%$  to  $1.85\%$  while the error of G17 at the sixth grid density was  $0.65\%$  .Continuing to increase the number of cells did not show significant improvement in the accuracy of the results. Therefore, the 3,800,000- 4,400,000 grids were selected for simulation calculations in this study. Table 4 listed the grid details of these four configurations.

To evaluate the time- step independence of the results, the upper limit temperature was calculated. Three different time steps (1, 3 and 5 seconds) were used to monitor Ture within 20 seconds. Figure S2 in the ESM showed that the calculated temperatures were nearly identical, and considering the computational cost, a maximum time step of  $5s$  was chosen.

# 2.3.4 Model validation and Uncertainty analysis

To verify the accuracy of the simulation model, several metrics were calculated, including the predicted root mean square deviation (PRMSD), mean absolute error (MAE), mean relative error (MRE), and normalized mean square error (NMSE) were calculated. The detailed calculation formulas were as follows:

$$
\mathrm{PRMSD} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}\left(y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i}\right)^{2}}}{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}y_{i}} \tag{1}

where,  $n$  is the number of data points,  $y_{i}$  and  $\hat{y}_i$  stand for the measured and simulated values, respectively, and  $\overline{y}$  is the mean of the measured values. Smaller values for these metrics indicate that the model's predictions are closer to the actual measured values.

The measurement errors in this study primarily arise from instrument uncertainties. Input variables in the heat load calculation, such as temperature, ventilation rate, and heat transfer coefficients, are subject to measurement errors, which propagate through the calculation formulas and affect the accuracy of the final results. Since multiple equations in the calculation process were temperature- dependent, this study focused on the influence of temperature measurement errors. These errors arose from indoor multi- source microclimate monitoring devices and outdoor weather stations. Prior to the experiment, the temperature sensors were thoroughly calibrated, with an estimated error of  $\pm 0.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The temperature measurement errors were incorporated into the heat load calculation, and an error propagation analysis was performed based on the total differential method (Xu et al. 2022b). The combined error in daytime and nighttime heat loss was approximately  $\pm 3.84\mathrm{kW}$ , which directly impacted the accuracy of the final energy balance calculation. It is critical to account for this error in subsequent heat load calculations based on measured data.

# 2.4 System operating cost and return on investment

For the electric heating system, the heating coefficient of performance (COP) is the ratio of heat released from the system  $(Q_{\mathrm{r}})$  to the total electric energy consumption.

$$
\mathrm{COP_E} = \frac{Q_{\mathrm{r}}}{E_{\mathrm{c}}} \tag{5}
$$

where,  $\mathrm{COP_E}$  is the heating coefficient of performance,  $Q_{\mathrm{r}}$  stands for the effective heat output of the thermoelectric boiler, and  $E_{\mathrm{c}}$  represents the input power.

$$
E_{\mathrm{c}} = \frac{\left(P_{1} + P_{2}\right)}{1000}\times \Delta T \tag{6}
$$

where,  $P_{1}$  and  $P_{2}$  stand for the power of heating device and water circulation device, and  $\Delta T$  is the device running hours.

$$
Q_{\mathrm{r}} = \sum m C_{\mathrm{p}}(t_{\mathrm{in}} - t_{\mathrm{out}}) / 3600\times \Delta T \tag{7}
$$

where,  $m$  is the water flowrate of the heating medium  $(\mathrm{m^3h^{- 1}})$ $C_\mathrm{p}$  stands for the specific heat capacity  $(\mathrm{kJkg^{- 1}^oC^{- 1}})$ $t_\mathrm{in}$  and  $t_\mathrm{out}$  represent the water supply and return temperature of thermoelectric boiler in heat storage stage, respectively. The formula for calculating the payback period  $(P_{\mathrm{b}})$  is as follow:

$$
P_{\mathrm{b}} = \frac{I_{\mathrm{c}} + R_{\mathrm{c}}}{R_{\mathrm{p}}} \tag{8}
$$

where  $I_{c}$  is the initial investment cost,  $R_{c}$  stands for the device running cost, and  $R_{\mathrm{p}}$  is the crop profit. The thermal load leveling (TTL) is determined as follows:

$$
\mathrm{TLL} = \frac{t_{\mathrm{max}} - t_{\mathrm{min}}}{t_{\mathrm{max}} + t_{\mathrm{min}}} \tag{9}
$$

The effective accumulated temperature is a crucial indicator that reflects the heat requirements for crop growth and development. Here, the biological zero degree is set at  $10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and the specific calculation formula is as follows:

$$
\mathrm{EAT} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}\overline{T} -10 \tag{10}
$$

# 3 Results and discussion

# 3.1 Microclimate characteristics within the cucumber canopy inside CSG

# 3.1.1 Spatial distribution of solar radiation

The analysis focused on sunny days (October 4, 2023 and December 1, 2023) and cloudy days (October 12, 2023 and December 10, 2023). During October, cucumber plants were in the seedling stage with sunlight available from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The sensors were unobstructed. By December, the cucumbers were in mature phase with sunlight available from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., keeping sensors not directly obstructed by leaves. The CSG was divided into three parts along its east- west direction (Figure 5), and the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of solar radiation inside greenhouse was compared. It was evident from Figure 5(b) that in the north- south direction of the greenhouse, the radiation intensity near the wall was significantly lower compared to

Fig. 5 The diurnal variation of light distribution inside Chinese solar greenhouse on sunny day: (a) the layout of the integrated sensors within greenhouse; (b) the spatial distribution of light in greenhouse without plant on October 4, 2023; (c) the spatial distribution of light in greenhouse with plant canopy on December 1, 2023

the middle and south parts, with average daily intercepted solar radiation differing by  $39.1\%$  and  $49.6\%$  respectively. There was a vertical decreasing in radiation intensity, with the daily average solar radiation in the upper and middle sections exceeding that of the bottom by  $6.2\%$  and  $3.5\%$  respectively. In the east- west direction, there was a trend of higher daily intercepted solar radiation in the east compared to the west. Solar radiation intensity decreased significantly from top to bottom within the canopy with crops growth (Figure 5(c)). The differences in radiation intensity at different heights were pronounced, with the upper and middle canopy sections exceeding the bottom by  $133.8\%$  and  $91.2\%$  respectively. In the north- south direction, the radiation intensity remained weakest near the wall, being  $3.8\%$  and  $17.7\%$  lower than the south and middle parts, respectively.

The solar radiation captured on cloudy days inside the greenhouse is primarily the scattered radiation. Radiation intensity decreased gradually from top to bottom within the greenhouse (Figure 6(a)), with the upper and middle sections exceeding the bottom by  $31.3\%$  and  $27.0\%$  respectively. In the north- south direction, the average intercepted solar radiation in the south and middle parts exceeded that in the north by  $102.1\%$  and  $81.5\%$  respectively. This difference became more pronounced in greenhouses with dense canopy (Figure 6(b)), where the average intercepted solar radiation in the south and middle parts exceeded that in the north by  $104.3\%$  and  $108.4\%$  respectively. The upper and middle sections surpassed the bottom by  $57.0\%$  and  $44.7\%$  respectively.

# 3.1.2 Spatial distribution of temperature and humidity

As shown in Figure 7, the 27 multi- source sensors in the canopy were divided into three horizontal planes:  $0.5\mathrm{m}$ ,  $1.0\mathrm{m}$ , and  $1.5\mathrm{m}$ , with each plane containing 9 sensors. The variation trend of temperature at night was relatively stable, but fluctuated significantly across different positions during the day. The western part of the greenhouse exhibited higher temperature than those in the central and eastern parts (Figures S3 and S4 in the ESM). The sensor near the wall (C1) recorded the highest temperature of  $32.6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The lowest temperature of  $17.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  was recorded near the front of lighting roof (A3). The largest temperature difference within the greenhouse occurred at  $1:10\mathrm{p.m}$ , with the temperature at  $1.5\mathrm{m}$  (C1) reaching  $30.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , while the temperature at  $0.5\mathrm{m}$  (A3) was only  $13.9^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , resulting in a temperature difference of  $16.8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . When the quilt was closed, the relative humidity remained at a high level. Upon opening the quilt in the morning, the relative humidity rapidly decreased, reaching its lowest point around  $2:00\mathrm{p.m}$ . As the ventilation openings were closed, the relative humidity gradually increased. As the canopy height increased, the relative humidity in the greenhouse gradually decreased. Specifically, fluctuations in relative humidity were relatively minor at the top of the canopy. In the east- west direction of the greenhouse, the daily average humidity was lowest in the east at  $68.9\%$ , followed by the west at  $76.2\%$ , with the highest daily average relative humidity in the central part reaching  $78.9\%$  (Figure S3). In the north- south direction, the daily average relative humidity was  $70.8\%$ ,  $75.3\%$ , and  $78.0\%$ , respectively (Figure S4).

Temperature on cloudy days was notably lower, and the lower limit of humidity was significantly higher compared to sunny days in Figure 8. Before opening the quilt, temperature at the top of the canopy was noticeably higher than those in the middle and lower parts. Due to the lack of direct solar radiation after opening the quilt, the heat loss in the greenhouse exceeded heat gain, resulting in a sharp temperature drop. By  $9:00\mathrm{a.m.}$ , the first point of thermal equilibrium between heat loss and gain was reached, followed by a gradual temperature increase. The temperature near the wall was notably higher compared to the central and southern parts (Figure S6). At  $4:00\mathrm{p.m.}$ , when the quilt was closed, the greenhouse temperature reached the lowest point of the day. The greenhouse temperature gradually raised later. The canopy showed a decreasing temperature trend from top to bottom, with average temperatures of  $18.1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ,  $17.8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and  $17.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (Figure S5). The largest temperature difference in the greenhouse on cloudy days occurred at  $8:00\mathrm{a.m.}$ , with temperatures reaching  $19.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  at  $1.5\mathrm{m}$  (C1). Temperatures at  $0.5\mathrm{m}$  (A3) were only  $16.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , resulting in a temperature difference of  $3.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . This measurement point for the maximum temperature difference aligned with the location observed during sunny day. Relative humidity in the greenhouse rapidly decreased after opening the quilt on cloudy days. When the ventilation vent was opened at  $1:00\mathrm{p.m.}$ , the relative humidity reached its lowest point at  $68.5\%$ . The relative humidity gradually increased after closing the vents, reaching a maximum daily value of  $97.3\%$ . The relative humidity above the canopy was notably lower than in the middle and bottom parts, with daily average humidity of  $85.8\%$ ,  $89.3\%$ , and  $89.7\%$ , respectively. The daily average humidity was  $83.6\%$  in the eastern part, while it reached  $90.9\%$  and  $90.3\%$  in the central and western parts. The daily average humidity was  $85.3\%$ ,  $89.1\%$ , and  $90.5\%$  in the north- south direction (Figures S5 and S6).

between indoor and outdoor environments of CSGs during the coldest winter period under different heating conditions. The minimum daily temperature in CSG without heating devices (G17) was maintained below  $10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , which was often insufficient for temperature- loving crops to overwinter. Among the actively heated greenhouses, G14 demonstrated better nighttime warming performance compared to CK and G15, with CK showing higher daytime temperatures. Compared to the unheated greenhouse, G14 the minimum indoor temperature by  $5.2 - 10.2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , with a maximum temperature difference between indoor and outdoor reaching  $29.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (January 22,  $1:30\mathrm{p.m.}$ ). G15 raised the minimum temperature by  $3.0 - 7.6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , with a maximum temperature difference of  $30.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (January 22,  $10:00\mathrm{a.m.}$ ). During the nighttime, the indoor relative humidity was notably higher than outdoor. Specifically, G14 exhibited the lowest relative humidity, followed by CK. Compared to G17, G14 reduced the relative humidity by  $4.2\% - 14.6\%$ , while G15 achieved a decrease of  $0.2\% - 3.7\%$ .

Table 5 summarized the temperature and humidity extremes and averages during the coldest period (January 9, 2024 to January 12, 2024) for different greenhouses. The G14 recorded the highest average temperature at  $17.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , with an average temperature difference between indoor and outdoor of  $19.8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Compared to G17, the average temperatures in G14, G15, and CK were increased by  $6.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ,  $5.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and  $6.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , respectively. Regarding relative humidity, G14 exhibited the lowest average relative humidity, which was  $4.1\%$  lower than G17. Meanwhile, G15 showed the highest average humidity, reaching  $85.9\%$ .

To further clarify the impact of temperature fluctuations caused by different greenhouse heating devices on crop production, we introduced the coefficient of thermal load leveling (TLL). The G14 exhibited the smallest TLL, with a mean value reaching 0.28 during the experimental stage. The G15 and CK recorded the TLL of 0.31 and 0.34, respectively. The non- heated greenhouse G17 showed the highest TLL with a value of 0.57 (Figure 10).

An analysis of the daily effective accumulated temperature during the coldest period was conducted for CSGs (Figure 11). Both the G14 and CK exhibited significantly higher daily effective accumulated temperature compared to the G15 and G17. Specifically, the average accumulated temperatures of G14, CK and G15 were  $7.45^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ,  $7.24^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and  $4.15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , respectively. In contrast, G17 had a low accumulated temperature of  $0.15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  during the experimental period, indicating that this greenhouse could not meet the requirements for crop production.

As shown in Figure 12, the hourly variations in microclimate among the four experimental CSGs were compared. The G14 exhibited better nighttime heating performance during the period covered by the quilt (9:00 p.m.- 8:00 a.m.) with an average temperature reaching  $16.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , significantly outperforming the other three CSGs. Specifically, the average temperatures during this period of G15, G17 and CK were  $12.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ,  $6.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and  $14.9^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , respectively. During the daytime under sunny day, the temperature in the CK reached  $26.1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , while temperatures in G14, G15, and G17 were  $21.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ,  $20.1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and  $15.1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , respectively. On cloudy days, G14 showed the best temperature performance with an average temperature of  $15.8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , compared to  $14.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in CK,  $13.6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in G15, and  $6.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  in G17. In terms of humidity, G14 demonstrated better

dehumidification capabilities under both sunny and cloudy days, with the average relative humidity of  $68.2\%$  and  $86.7\%$  respectively. G15, G17, and CK exhibited average humidity of  $80.7\%$ $74.9\%$  and  $79.5\%$  under sunny day, and  $95.1\%$ $87.4\%$  and  $88.8\%$  under cloudy day.

Based on the comprehensive analysis, the greenhouse equipped with distributed tubular radiator (G14) provided a more suitable environment for crop growth. This device maintained average nighttime temperatures above  $15^{\circ}C$  and effectively reduced relative humidity. Compared to similar type of greenhouses, it decreased nighttime relative humidity by  $3.9\% - 9.0\%$ . The use of the heating device effectively reduced the TLL, thereby preventing growth inhibition caused by temperature fluctuations. The G14 demonstrated better performance in daily accumulated effective temperature, offering a microclimate with high temperature and low humidity, which is conducive to higher yield and enhancing crop quality.

# 3.3 Interaction between greenhouse and crop

# 3.3.1 The same greenhouse

The spatial and temporal variations in average temperature and humidity within the same greenhouse (G14) were compared under the scenarios with and without a canopy structure (Figure 13). Considering the characteristic of temperature and humidity distribution in the east- west direction of greenhouse, the eastern and western canopies were removed (considered as an empty greenhouse area), while the central canopy was retained for analyzing the interaction between crops and the greenhouse environment. Figure 13(a) illustrates that under cloudy conditions, the average temperature of the central crop canopy was lower than that of the eastern and western regions by  $0.36^{\circ}C$  and  $0.31^{\circ}C$ , respectively. During the night, the average temperature of the central crop canopy was lower than that

Note: the data was from the greenhouse with the heating piping

of the eastern and western regions by  $0.18^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and  $0.15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , respectively. On sunny day, the night temperature in the central region was significantly lower than in the eastern and western regions, with the average temperature lower by  $0.47^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and  $1.1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , respectively. The daytime temperature in the central region was lower than in the western region but higher than in the eastern region, with average temperatures of  $20.9^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ,  $18.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and  $17.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , respectively. The presence of canopy significantly affected relative humidity inside greenhouse. The average humidity in the central region was higher by  $7.6\%$  and  $3.0\%$  compared to the eastern and western regions under cloudy conditions, respectively (Figure 13(b)). On sunny days, the average relative humidity in the central region was higher by  $14.6\%$  and  $3.8\%$  compared to that of the eastern and western regions, respectively (Figure 13(d)).

# 3.3.2 The different greenhouses

After the complete harvesting of G14, as an empty greenhouse, the microclimate was compared with G15, which had a dense canopy. Both greenhouses followed identical management practices and had ceased heating. The night temperature of G14 was significantly higher than that of G15 under both sunny and cloudy day, with average temperature differences of  $0.8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and  $1.6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , respectively (Figure 14). After opening the quilt, temperatures of G15 rapidly increased in the morning, particularly evident on sunny day, where the maximum temperature difference between the two greenhouses could reach  $5.1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  by 11:30 a.m. The average daytime temperature for G14 and G15 were  $18.8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and  $19.8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , respectively. The temperature of G15 was generally lower than G14 for cloudy day, with a maximum temperature difference reaching  $1.8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  at noon. The average daytime temperatures for G14 and G15 were  $15.3^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and  $14.9^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , respectively.

It was noteworthy that the temperature in G14 exceeded that of G15 around noon during both the sunny and cloudy days. This phenomenon was closely related to the absence of canopy in G14. After the quilt was opened in the morning, the solar radiation passing through the G14 film was absorbed by the walls and ground, where it was converted into heat and stored. In G15, the tomato canopy was relatively dense, creating a localized microclimate with limited ventilation. As a result, the air temperature in G15 rose rapidly in the morning due to the increasing solar altitude and radiation intensity. During winter, brief ventilation is required around noon to maintain an appropriate concentration of carbon dioxide within the greenhouse, causing a rapid temperature drop in the canopy region of G15. Meanwhile, G14 has reached a certain amount of heat accumulation, which strengthened the release of heat to the outside while storing heat. This resulted in the temperature in G14 being higher than that in G15. With the decrease of the solar radiation intensity in the afternoon, the temperature difference between the two greenhouses was not significant. After covering the quilt, the heat storage capacity of the

G14 was again reflected. Figure 14(b) illustrated that on both sunny and cloudy days, the presence of canopies significantly increased the relative humidity. The relative humidity was  $87.0\%$  in G14 and  $92.6\%$  in G15 on the sunny day, and it was  $87.6\%$  in G14 and  $93.8\%$  in G15 on the cloud day, representing increases of  $5.6\%$  and  $6.2\%$ , respectively.

# 3.4 Evaluation of the heating system

# 3.4.1 Calculation of heating load of CSG in winter

The heat losses of CSG were determined by using heat transfer theory, with the specific formulas and relevant parameters listed in Table 2 and Table 3. The detailed calculating process was shown in the supplementary material of the online version of this paper. The results indicated that when the quilt was opened, the greenhouse released an average of  $165.73\mathrm{kW}$  of heat per hour. After the cover was closed, the average heat release decreased to  $56.94\mathrm{kW}$ . Upon opening the quilt, the CSG primarily lost heat through the lighting roof and ventilation, accounting for  $55.9\%$  and  $38.5\%$ , respectively (Figure 15). Other components contributed relatively lower percentages with only  $5.6\%$  totally. After closing the quilt, the heat loss occurred predominantly through infiltration of cold air  $(47.4\%)$  and the lighting roof  $(33.0\%)$ . Heat losses from the soil and wall accounted for  $6.5\%$  with the roof contributing  $5.2\%$ . The lighting roof served as the main pathway for heat dissipation, with a heat load of approximately  $27.6\mathrm{Wm}^{- 2}$  (Figure 15(b)). This was followed by losses from the roof, wall, and cold air infiltration, with heat loads of  $24.72\mathrm{Wm}^{- 2}$ ,  $16.56\mathrm{Wm}^{- 2}$ , and  $15.78\mathrm{Wm}^{- 2}$ , respectively.

In the process of greenhouse heating design, it is crucial to analyze the greenhouse's heat gains and losses. Unlike previous methods that treated the lighting roof as a flat plane to calculate captured solar energy, we employed a 3D simulation model to integrate considerations of curved surface refraction, reflection, transmission. The results showed that the average solar radiation captured by the lighting roof amounted to  $2025\mathrm{kW}$ . By assessing the greenhouse's captured solar radiation and day- to- night heat losses, we identified a heat deficit of  $211.88\mathrm{kW}$  required to achieve the optimal growing environment. This highlighted the necessity of designing heating devices for Beijing's greenhouse systems. Giving the irreversible damage cold stress can cause to crops, the nighttime greenhouse heat losses was served as the basis for calculating the radiator's heat output, which results in an hourly heat supply of  $56.94\mathrm{kW}$ . Theoretical calculations show that, at an extreme temperature of  $- 12^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , the average energy consumption per hour required to maintain the greenhouse temperature

Fig. 15 The composition of the greenhouse heat loss and proportions: (a) heat loss of greenhouse components; (b) heat loss intensity of each greenhouse components

at  $12^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  is  $88.97 \mathrm{Wm}^{- 2}$ . By incorporating the required heat and performance parameters of the electric heating device into equations (Equation B7 in Table 2) and (Equation B8), the appropriate radiator configuration for the greenhouse can be calculated. Specifically, 444 column radiators and  $390 \mathrm{m}$  of tube radiators were needed. G14 was equipped with 14 sets of tube radiators totaling  $398 \mathrm{m}$  of pipes, while greenhouse G15 currently had 19 sets of 24- column column radiators totaling 456 columns, both meeting the thermal load requirements. During experimental period, on January 22, 2024, at  $2:00 \mathrm{a.m.}$ , when the lowest temperature was  $- 11.1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , G14 maintained an internal temperature of  $15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , essentially meeting design requirements. However, greenhouse G15 achieved only  $10.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , slightly below the design requirement. At this time, the temperature in the non- heated greenhouse was  $4.9^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , while in CK, it was  $11.7^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .

# 3.4.2 Heating system optimization and management

To gain a clearer understanding of the temperature distribution within experimental greenhouses using different heating systems, this study conducted thermal environment visualization and simulation analyses. The accuracy of the simulations was verified by comparing simulated values with sensor- measured data at corresponding positions inside G14. Specific verification results were shown in Figure S7 and Table S2, which fully proved the reliability of the model. Figure 16 presented side views of temperature distribution at midnight and schematic diagrams of heat distribution on walls for different heating systems (March 1, 2024). The CK greenhouse showed the highest temperature distribution. For greenhouses with the same structure parameters, G14 with tubular radiators exhibited significantly higher nighttime temperatures compared to the G15 and G17. Figure 16(a) showed the temperature variation along the north- south direction, with highest temperatures near the wall, gradually decreasing from north to south. Heat dissipated by radiators traveled upward along the wall, resulting in surface temperatures on the top noticeably higher than the air temperature. Although the greenhouse equipped with column radiators similarly demonstrated the heating process during nighttime, its overall heating effectiveness was inferior to that of tubular radiators. This disparity was more clearly observed in the temperature distribution across the wall, where tubular radiators exhibited a more uniform heat distribution compared to column radiators.

# 3.4.3 System operating cost and return on investment

Considering initial investment, operational time, running costs, and device performance is essential for maximizing economic efficiency in agricultural production. We have calculated the electricity consumption of the heating systems in CSG, with the relevant performance parameters listed in Table 1. The results indicated that the daily electricity consumption was  $255.2 \mathrm{kWh}$  for G14 and  $254.2 \mathrm{kWh}$  for G15. With an electricity cost of  $0.08 \mathrm{USD}$  per kWh in Beijing, the daily operational costs were  $20.93 \mathrm{USD}$  and  $20.85 \mathrm{USD}$ , respectively. By measuring the inflow and outlet water temperatures, water flow rates, and operational hours of greenhouse heating systems, the effective heat output of the tubular radiator and column radiator was calculated (Equation C2 in Table 2). The heat output for the heating system in greenhouse G14 was  $850 \mathrm{MJ}$ , while that for G15

was  $680\mathrm{MJ}$  . Incorporating these results into formula (Equation C1), the values of Coefficient of Performance COP) for G14 and G15 were calculated to be 0.93 and 0.68, respectively.

The initial investment of per unit area for the heating system in G14 was 3.98 USD, with operational costs of 1.96 USD. It was expected to increase cucumber yield by  $26.1\%$  have a design lifespan of 15 years, and achieve an estimated payback period of 4.7 years. For G15, the initial investment of per unit area for the heating system was 2.91 USD, with operational costs of 1.95 USD. It was expected to increase tomato yield by  $16.2\%$  have a design lifespan of 10 years, and achieve an estimated payback period of 6.0 years (Table 6).

# 4 Discussion

# 4.1 Spatial distribution of solar greenhouse microclimate

Solar greenhouse is a complex and integrated system, where temperature and humidity distributions result from a combination of external meteorological factors and internal crop energy conversion (Xu et al. 2022a). These environmental factors directly impact the intrinsic physiological changes of crops (Liu et al. 2012). The excessively low humidity can lead to crop water stress and inhibit growth (Yang et al. 2023). For the experimental greenhouse discussed here, the minimum relative humidity in winter was maintained at  $25.5\%$  with an average relative humidity of  $76.6\%$  which fully met the lower limit of humidity required for crop growth. Due to the unique lighting structure of CSG, solar radiation intensity gradually decreased from south to north, with the light environment being weakest near the wall, regardless of whether it was a sunny or cloudy day (Li et al. 2016). There was no significant difference in lighting conditions along the east- west direction. Vertically, solar radiation intensity decreased gradually from top to bottom (Li et al. 2023).

Changes in internal humidity in the greenhouse are primarily influenced by solar radiation, crop transpiration, and evaporation. On sunny day, there was a significant difference in relative humidity from top to bottom, with values of  $70.1\%$ $76.0\%$  and  $78.0\%$  respectively. Along the east- west direction, the daily average relative humidity was lowest in the east at  $68.9\%$  followed by the west at  $76.2\%$  and highest in the central area at  $78.9\%$  .The analysis revealed that the buffer room of the experimental greenhouse was situated in the eastern part, where daily human activities cause rapid heat loss and the expulsion of humid air. Thus, humidity in the eastern part was significantly reduced, which also affected temperature distribution. From south to north, the average temperatures gradually decreased. In practical production, crops in the southern and northern parts of the greenhouse tended to exhibit weaker growth and lower fruit yield compared to those in the central part due to low temperature and weak light. Therefore, optimizing the CSG microclimate should focus on increasing temperatures in the southern part and improving lighting near the northern wall, while ensuring the tightness of buffer room in winter. The installation of dehumidification equipment near the southern part of the greenhouse should also be considered.

# 4.2 Interaction between solar greenhouse and crop

The presence of crops significantly affects the spatial distribution of temperature and humidity within the greenhouse (Reza et al. 2023). The solar shortwave radiation penetrates the lighting roof, and is converted into long- wave radiation inside CSG. This radiation is then reflected back by the internal of lighting roof, creating a high- temperature environment (Zhang et al. 2023). The crop canopy intercepts a portion of solar radiation for photosynthesis and transpiration, resulting in a relative reduction of solar radiation acquired by the greenhouse structures. Consequently, this leads to lower nighttime temperatures compared to empty greenhouse without crops, while transpiration simultaneously consumes heat and increases the relative humidity in the air. The findings of this study revealed that, on sunny days, the average temperature in areas with cucumber canopies inside the greenhouse decreased by  $2.5^{\circ}C$  compared to areas without crops, and the relative humidity increased by  $3.8\%$  The average temperature with canopy decreased by  $0.31^{\circ}C,$  and accompanied by a  $3.0\%$  increase in relative humidity on cloudy day. During the clear night, the presence of the cucumber canopy negatively affected the air temperature, causing a decrease of  $1.1^{\circ}C$  compared to areas without crops, while on cloudy nights, the decrease was  $0.15\%$

The presence of tomato crops significantly increased the relative humidity in the greenhouse, with an increase of  $5.6\%$  on sunny days and  $6.2\%$  on cloudy days. The effects of cucumber and tomato crop canopies on air temperature

during daytime were distinct. The average temperature in the greenhouse containing tomato crops was  $1.0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  higher than in the empty greenhouse on sunny days, while on cloudy days, the greenhouse with tomato crops was  $0.4^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  cooler than the empty greenhouse. The temperature within the cucumber canopy was lower than that without canopy area, attributed to the canopy's photosynthetic activity consuming energy, thereby lowering the air temperature (Barron- Gafford et al. 2019). Interestingly, the tomato canopy, although absorbing heat, created a locally warmer microclimate in the morning compared to the empty greenhouse area due to its denser canopy and poor ventilation. Future studies should conduct a more detailed analysis of this process by combining photosynthesis instruments with model simulations. To understand the complex responses of crops to greenhouse environments and artificial management measures, as well as the dynamic responses of greenhouse environments to external conditions, researchers have developed greenhouse climate models and crop models (Kahlen et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2020; de Vries 2021; Xu et al. 2022a; Batnassi et al. 2023). The information obtained in this study is crucial for the improvement and optimization of these models, especially for precise microclimate interpretation.

# 4.3 Suggestions on active temperature heating and structural optimization of solar greenhouse

The obtained results indicated that, during the coldest period, solar radiation provides sufficient heat to meet approximately  $90\%$  of the energy needs for CSG. The daily solar influx into the greenhouse is insufficient, and indefinitely enhancing insulation is impractical. Therefore, to ensure profitability for greenhouse growers, supplementary heating facilities are essential under the premise of high efficiency and energy savings. The CSG lighting roof intercepts solar energy during the day as the primary surface for heat acquisition, but becomes the weakest part for insulation at night, with  $33\%$  of heat loss directly escaping through it. Effective thermal insulation strategies for CSG should focus on maintaining the integrity and sealing of greenhouse covering materials and structural components, thereby reducing gaps and preventing heat transfer through infiltration. Simultaneously, efforts should be made to optimize these materials without compromising light transmission, aiming to enhance the economic efficiency of winter production in daylight greenhouses and reduce energy consumption per unit of greenhouse output (Tong et al. 2022). Moreover, optimizing greenhouse structures to maximize solar energy utilization can effectively enhance the economic viability of crop production processes (Zhang et al. 2022a). It is crucial to consider structure adaptability to different climatic conditions during the greenhouse design phase. Comparative data analysis in this study revealed that the CK achieves higher temperatures on sunny day but experiences weaker thermal conditions on cloudy day, attributed to its smaller volume and lower proportion of heat storage materials.

The electric heating system used in this study employed water as a heat medium, benefiting from water's high thermal inertia, which ensures high stability and uniformity in temperature regulation of the heating system (Xu et al. 2020). Although the initial investment and operational costs for heat storage devices are higher, the system offers strong controllability and is unaffected by external weather conditions, thus safeguarding crops from irreversible cold stress. Heat dissipation devices in both G14 and G15 meet the requirements based on calculations of greenhouse heat loads. However, the performance of tubular radiators exceeds that of columnar radiators in practical production. Columnar radiators are prone to rust and blockage in high humidity greenhouse environments, limiting their heat dissipation efficiency. G14 demonstrated similar effectiveness in TLL and accumulated temperature effects compared to the gas- heated CK, while electric heating is not constrained by greenhouse geographical location and can be applied for independent heating in remote areas. Overall, tubular radiators are more suitable for greenhouse heating, and electric heating devices can effectively replace fossil fuels for clean greenhouse heating. Further research should focus on optimizing parameters such as installation height and tube type for tubular radiators. With advancements in energy technologies like photovoltaics, future integration of greenhouse operations with photovoltaic electricity generation could achieve self- sufficiency in electricity production and sales, promoting the development of high- value greenhouses in northern regions (La Notte et al. 2020).

# 5 Conclusions

The purpose of this study was to accurately assess the microclimate spatial heterogeneity of Chinese solar greenhouse, the interaction mechanisms between crops and greenhouse environments, and the performance of different heating systems through experimental methods. The main conclusions are as follows:

(1) For east-west oriented CSG, the spatial distribution of the microclimate exhibits distinct patterns. Vertically, temperature and solar radiation decrease gradually from top to bottom, whereas relative humidity increases. Horizontally, temperature decreases gradually, while relative humidity and solar radiation intensity increase from north to south. Additionally, the relative humidity and temperature increase gradually from east to west.

(2) The presence of canopies leads to a nighttime temperature

reduction of  $1.1^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (cucumber) and  $1.6^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (tomato). During the daytime, the presence of tomato canopies increases air temperature by approximately  $1.0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , whereas cucumber canopies decrease air temperature by approximately  $2.5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The presence of canopies significantly increases air relative humidity, with cucumber canopy increasing by  $3.0\% - 3.8\%$  and tomato canopy by  $5.6\% - 6.2\%$ .

(3) The tubular radiators provide more suitable growing environments for greenhouses. Compared to non-heated greenhouses, minimum temperatures increase by  $5.2^{\circ}\mathrm{C} - 10.2^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and maximum relative humidity decreases by  $4.2\% - 14.6\%$ . The investment payback period for tubular radiators is 4.7 years.

These findings elucidate the complex dynamics of the greenhouse microclimate and its interactions with crops, highlighting the efficacy of specific heating systems in optimizing crop production environments under varying conditions.
