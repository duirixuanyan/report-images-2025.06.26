Michael F. Modest出生于柏林，在德国度过了前25年的人生。在慕尼黑工业大学获得Dipl.-Ing.学位后，他来到美国，并于1972年在加州大学伯克利分校获得机械工程硕士和博士学位，在那里他首次接触了热辐射的理论和实验。此后，他在辐射传热的所有领域开展了许多研究项目（测量表面、液体和气体特性；表面传输和参与介质内的理论建模）。由于许多激光束是热辐射的一种形式，他的工作还包括材料激光加工中的传热方面。

他曾在伦斯勒理工学院和南加州大学任教多年，并在宾夕法尼亚州立大学担任机械工程教授24年。如今，Modest博士是加州大学默塞德分校的Shaffer和George工程教授，这是加州大学系统的第10个校区，也是21世纪第一所新成立的研究型大学。他是美国机械工程师学会会士，美国航空航天学会副会士。Modest博士和他的妻子Monika居住在加利福尼亚州默塞德。

自《辐射传热》第二版出版以来，又一个十年过去了。热辐射仍然是一个相对年轻的领域，其基本关系可追溯至20世纪初，而系统的传热模型直到1950年代才开始出现。过去十年间，该领域的持续关注催生了许多重大进展和新兴研究课题。因此，本书第三版的内容再次进行了重大调整以反映这些新增知识，并进一步提升了可读性和实用性。

本书的宗旨保持不变，其定位不仅限于作为一学期热辐射核心课程的标准教材——因为单门研究生课程显然无法涵盖辐射传热领域的所有重要主题。书中对一些超出"标准"课程范围的重要领域进行了详细阐述。我们期望那些曾以本书作为研究生教材的工程师，能够通过自学掌握这些进阶内容。通过囊括所有重要的高级主题以及大量延伸阅读文献，本书也致力于成为执业工程师的参考手册。

第三版的主要变化包括：将统计蒙特卡罗方法的章节拆分为两部分。第一部分涉及表面辐射，现被大幅提前至教材前部，使教师能将其纳入单学期课程的表面辐射讨论环节。第二部分针对参与性介质的内容则大幅扩充，纳入了该领域的诸多新进展，如光谱解析方案、随机介质扩展方法等。过去十年间，逆辐射问题与微纳尺度辐射传热领域尤为活跃。因此，逆辐射章节已完全重写，并新增了纳米尺度辐射传热章节。这两章应视为对这些广阔领域的入门导引，为工程师提供基础认知以便进一步研读相关文献。气体物性章节与非灰模型章节也因该领域的持续突破及对非平衡辐射日益增长的研究兴趣而进行了重大修订。

描述计算机程序的附录得以保留，相关代码可通过专属网站 https://booksite.elsevier.com/9780123869449 下载。部分基础代码专为辅助读者解决表面传热章节的习题而设计，另一些则源自研究项目：既有适合研究生完成复杂作业或学期项目的初级程序，也有仅供开展自主研究的执业工程师使用的高阶工具。考虑到许多研究生不再学习Fortran和$\mathrm{C + + }$等编译语言，基础程序现已同步提供MATLAB®版本。

此外还进行了诸多细节调整：删减过时内容，增补最新研究成果，重组章节结构以提升可读性。当然，文献引用已全面更新，各章末尾也新增了大量习题。与前两版相同，每章都详尽展示所有解析方法的推导过程，并通过实例演示如何将理论关系应用于实际问题。章末习题则为学生提供额外练习机会，帮助掌握前文所述的解析方法。这种全面的解析阐述使得任何具备微积分和微分方程基础的科研人员——无论是从事炉膛计算的热传导工程师、研究建筑照明的建筑师、关注海洋透光性的海洋学家，还是探究大气辐射问题的气象学家——都能通过自学理解相关内容。采用本书授课的教师可通过注册 https://www.inspectioncopy.elsevier.com/book/details/9780323984065 获取扩展版教师解答手册。

本书现分为24章，涵盖辐射传热领域的四大主要方向。在引言之后，有两章专门讨论不透明表面辐射特性的理论与应用，包括实验方法的简要介绍。随后五章研究无"辐射参与性介质"的封闭空间内表面间纯辐射交换，另有一章探讨传导、对流与表面辐射的相互作用。其余章节则聚焦于吸收、发射和散射介质（或称"参与性介质"）中的辐射传输问题。在详细推导辐射传递方程后，本书继续讨论气体、颗粒及半透明介质的辐射特性，同样包含实验方法的简要说明。接下来八章系统阐述参与性介质中辐射传热理论，划分为若干基础问题领域与求解方法。最终以三章作结，分别讨论多模式耦合传热以及逆辐射与纳米尺度辐射传热这两个新兴领域。

本书采用模块化写作方式。第2章虽对电磁波理论进行了相当详尽（尽管简明）的论述，但多数教师在首门辐射传热课程中会跳过该章。关于不透明表面特性的章节自成体系，并非后续内容的必要基础。表面传输相关五章（第4至9章）同样独立成篇，不构成参与性介质辐射研究的先决条件。同理，参与性介质特性的论述也非求解方法章节的必备基础。遵循相同逻辑，第14至21章讨论的不同求解视角与方法可任意调整学习顺序（尽管第21章需以第8章知识为前提）。最后三章是否讲授完全取决于教师或其学生的偏好。

我未刻意标注单学期热辐射课程应涵盖的内容，因不同教师对此必有不同见解。事实上，各主题的相对重要性不仅因教师而异，还取决于学生背景、地域或授课年份。个人建议单学期课程应均衡覆盖四大领域（表面特性、表面传输、参与性介质特性及参与性介质中的传输）。针对本科阶段接触热辐射较少的美国学生，建议用约半数课时讲授第1、3、4、5章及第7、8/9章部分内容（略过高级专题）。尽管第8章的蒙特卡罗方法属"进阶内容"，但极受学生欢迎，同时能让学生掌握这一日益重要的工程工具。后半学期应聚焦第10、11、12章（同样略去次要内容），适当覆盖第14章，并深入讨论第15章。若时间允许（主要取决于表面和/或参与性介质特性的讲解深度），建议补充$P_1$近似法（可独立讲授，如第16章开头所示）、离散坐标法的基本思想，和/或第20章部分内容（非灰介质求解方法）。

第三版在增补新材料的同时，虽删减了过时内容，篇幅仍较前版显著增加。衷心感谢全球多位挚友与同仁在本书修订决策过程中给予的指导，包括：A. Charette（魁北克）、P. Coelho（里斯本）、K. Daun（加拿大滑铁卢）、L. Dombrovsky（莫斯科）、W. Lipinski（明尼苏达）、S. Mazumder（俄亥俄）、K. Mitra（佛罗里达）、L. Pilon（加利福尼亚）、S. Thynell（宾夕法尼亚）及R. Viskanta（印第安纳）。当然，十位教授必有十二种见解：若未采纳全部建议，还望海涵。特别感谢Z. Zhang（佐治亚）提供的MATLAB®小程序，据此生成了图24-7与24-8。另向两位年轻同事致以特殊谢意：Wojciech Lipinski撰写了"多孔固体辐射特性"（第13章）与"聚光太阳能系统中的辐射"（第22章）两节；Kyle Daun则投入大量时间协助重写"逆辐射"章节（第23章）。同时感谢博士后J. Cai与R. Marquez将基础计算机程序（附录F）转换为MATLAB®版本。最后，谨以此纪念我已故的秘书Eileen Stevenson，她多年前为初版书稿打字，近期不幸早逝。

The following is a list of symbols used frequently in this book. A number of symbols have been used for several different purposes. Alas, the Roman alphabet has only 26 lowercase and another 26 uppercase letters, and the Greek alphabet provides 34 more different ones, for a total of 86, which is, unfortunately, not nearly enough. Hopefully, the context will always make it clear which meaning of the symbols is to be used. I have used what I hope is a simple and uncluttered set of variable names. This usage, of course, comes at a price. For example, the subscript  $\lambda$  is often dropped (meaning "at a given wavelength," or "per unit wavelength"), assuming that the reader recognizes the variable as a spectral quantity from the context. Whenever applicable, units have been attached to the variables in the following table. Variables without indicated units have multiple sets of units.

# CHAPTER 1

# FUNDAMENTALS OF THERMAL RADIATION

# 1.1 INTRODUCTION

The terms radiative heat transfer and thermal radiation are commonly used to describe the science of the heat transfer caused by electromagnetic waves. Obvious everyday examples of thermal radiation include the heating effect of sunshine on a clear day, the fact that- - when one is standing in front of a fire- - the side of the body facing the fire feels much hotter than the back, and so on. More subtle examples of thermal radiation are that the clear sky is blue, that sunsets are red, and that, during a clear winter night, we feel more comfortable in a room whose curtains are drawn than in a room (heated to the same temperature) with open curtains.

All materials continuously emit and absorb electromagnetic waves, or photons, by lowering or raising their molecular energy levels. The strength and wavelengths of emission depend on the temperature of the emitting material. As we shall see, for heat transfer applications wavelengths between  $10^{- 7}\mathrm{m}$  and  $10^{- 3}\mathrm{m}$  (ultraviolet, visible, and infrared) are of greatest importance and are, therefore, the only ones considered here.

Before embarking on the analysis of thermal radiation we want briefly to compare the nature of this mode of heat transfer with the other two possible mechanisms of transferring energy, conduction and convection. In the case of conduction in a solid, energy is carried through the atomic lattice by free electrons or by phonon- phonon interactions (i.e., excitation of vibrational energy levels for interatomic bonds). In gases and liquids, energy is transferred from molecule to molecule through collisions (i.e., the faster molecule loses some of its kinetic energy to the slower one). Heat transfer by convection is similar, but many of the molecules with raised kinetic energy are carried away by the flow and are replaced by colder fluid (low- kinetic- energy molecules), resulting in increased energy transfer rates. Thus, both conduction and convection require the presence of a medium for the transfer of energy. Thermal radiation, on the other hand, is transferred by electromagnetic waves, or photons, which may travel over a long distance without interacting with a medium. The fact that thermal radiation does not require a medium for its transfer makes it of great importance in vacuum and space applications. This so- called "action at a distance" also manifests itself in a number of everyday thermodynamic applications. For example, on a cold winter day in a heated room we feel more comfortable when the curtains are closed: our bodies exchange heat by convection with the warm air surrounding us, but also by radiation with walls (including cold window panes if they are without curtains); we feel the heat from a fire a distance away from us, and so on.

Another distinguishing feature between conduction and convection on the one hand and thermal radiation on the other is the difference in their temperature dependencies. For the vast majority of conduction applications heat transfer rates are well described by Fourier's law as

$$
q_{x} = -k\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}, \tag{1.1}
$$

where  $q_{x}$  is conducted heat flux<sup>1</sup> in the  $x$ - direction,  $T$  is temperature, and  $k$  is the thermal conductivity of the medium. Similarly, convective heat flux may usually be calculated from a correlation such as

$$
q = h(T - T_{\infty}), \tag{1.2}
$$

where  $h$  is known as the convective heat transfer coefficient, and  $T_{\infty}$  is a reference temperature. While  $k$  and  $h$  may depend on temperature, this dependence is usually not very strong. Thus, for most applications, conductive and convective heat transfer rates are linearly proportional to temperature differences. As we shall see, radiative heat transfer rates are generally proportional to differences in temperature to the fourth (or higher) power, i.e.,

$$
q\propto T^4 -T_\infty^4. \tag{1.3}
$$

Therefore, radiative heat transfer becomes more important with rising temperature levels and may be totally dominant over conduction and convection at very high temperatures. Thus, thermal radiation is important in combustion applications (fires, furnaces, rocket nozzles, engines, etc.), in nuclear reactions (such as in the sun, in a fusion reactor, or in nuclear bombs), during atmospheric reentry of space vehicles, etc. As modern technology strives for higher efficiencies, this will require higher and higher temperatures, making thermal radiation ever more important. Other applications that are increasing in importance include solar energy collection and the greenhouse effect (both due to emission from our high- temperature sun). And, finally, one of the most pressing issues for mankind today are the effects of global warming, caused by the absorption of solar energy by man- made carbon dioxide released into the Earth's atmosphere.

The same reasons that make thermal radiation important in vacuum and high- temperature applications also make its analysis more difficult, or at least quite different from "conventional" analyses. Under normal conditions, conduction and convection are short- range phenomena: The average distance between molecular collisions (mean free path for collision) is generally very small, maybe around  $10^{- 10}$  m. If it takes, say, 10 collisions until a high- kinetic- energy molecule has a kinetic energy similar to that of the surrounding molecules, then any external influence is not directly felt over a distance larger than  $10^{- 9}$  m. Thus we are able to perform an energy balance on an "infinitesimal volume," i.e., a volume negligibly small in comparison with overall dimensions, but very large in comparison with the mean free path for collision. The principle of conservation of energy then leads to a partial differential equation to describe the temperature field and heat fluxes for both conduction and convection. This equation may have up to four independent variables (three space coordinates and time) and is linear in temperature for the case of constant properties. Thermal radiation, on the other hand, is generally a long- range phenomenon. The mean free path for a photon (i.e., the average distance a photon travels before interacting with a molecule) may be as short as  $10^{- 10}$  m (e.g., absorption in a metal), but can also be as long as  $10^{+10}$  m or larger (e.g., the sun's rays hitting Earth). Thus, conservation of energy cannot be applied over an infinitesimal volume, but must be applied over the entire volume under consideration. This leads to an integral equation in up to seven independent variables (the frequency of radiation, three space coordinates, two coordinates describing the direction of travel of photons, and time).

The analysis of thermal radiation is further complicated by the behavior of the radiative properties of materials. Properties relevant to conduction and convection (thermal conductivity,

kinematic viscosity, density, etc.) are fairly easily measured and are generally well behaved (isotropic throughout the medium, perhaps with weak temperature dependence). Radiative properties are usually difficult to measure and often display erratic behavior. For liquids and solids the properties normally depend only on a very thin surface layer, which may vary strongly with surface preparation and often even from day to day. All radiative properties (in particular for gases) may vary strongly with wavelength, adding another dimension to the governing equation. Rarely, if ever, may this equation be assumed to be linear.

Because of these difficulties inherent in the analysis of thermal radiation, a good portion of this book has been set aside to discuss radiative properties and different approximate methods to solve the governing energy equation for radiative transport.

# 1.2 THE NATURE OF THERMAL RADIATION

Thermal radiative energy may be viewed as consisting of electromagnetic waves (as predicted by electromagnetic wave theory) or as consisting of massless energy parcels, called photons (as predicted by quantum mechanics). Neither point of view is able to describe completely all radiative phenomena that have been observed. It is, therefore, customary to use both concepts interchangeably. In general, radiative properties of liquids and solids (including tiny particles), and of interfaces (surfaces) are more easily predicted using electromagnetic wave theory, while radiative properties of gases are more conveniently obtained from quantum mechanics.

All electromagnetic waves, or photons, are known to propagate through any medium at a high velocity. Since light is a part of the electromagnetic wave spectrum, this velocity is known as the speed of light, c. The speed of light depends on the medium through which it travels, and may be related to the speed of light in vacuum,  $c_{0}$ , by the formula

$$
c = \frac{c_0}{n},\qquad c_0 = 2.998\times 10^8\mathrm{m / s}, \tag{1.4}
$$

where  $n$  is known as the refractive index of the medium. By definition, the refractive index of vacuum is  $n \equiv 1$ . For most gases the refractive index is very close to unity, for example, air at room temperature has  $n = 1.00029$  over the visible spectrum. Therefore, light propagates through gases nearly as fast as through vacuum. Electromagnetic waves travel considerably slower through dielectrics (electric nonconductors), which have refractive indices between approximately 1.4 and 4, and they hardly penetrate at all into electrical conductors (metals). Each wave may be identified either by its frequency,  $\nu$  (measured in cycles  $\mathrm{s} = \mathrm{s}^{- 1} = \mathrm{Hz}$ ); wavelength,  $\lambda$ ; (measured in  $\mu \mathrm{m} = 10^{- 6}\mathrm{m}$  or  $\mathrm{nm} = 10^{- 9}\mathrm{m}$ ); wavenumber,  $\eta$  (measured in  $\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ); or angular frequency,  $\omega$  (measured in radians  $\mathrm{s} = \mathrm{s}^{- 1}$ ).

All four quantities are related to one another through the formulae

$$
\nu = \frac{\omega}{2\pi} = \frac{c}{\lambda} = c\eta . \tag{1.5}
$$

Each wave or photon carries with it an amount of energy,  $\epsilon$ , determined from quantum mechanics as

$$
\epsilon = h\nu ,h = 6.626\times 10^{-34}\mathrm{Js}, \tag{1.6}
$$

where  $h$  is known as Planck's constant. The frequency of light does not change when light penetrates from one medium to another since the energy of the photon must be conserved. On the other hand, wavelength and wavenumber do, depending on the values of the refractive

FIGURE 1-1 Electromagnetic wave spectrum (for radiation traveling through vacuum,  $n = 1$ ).

index for the two media. Sometimes electromagnetic waves are characterized in terms of the energy that a photon carries,  $h\nu$ , using the energy unit electron volt  $(1\mathrm{eV} = 1.6022\times 10^{- 19}\mathrm{J})$ . Thus, light with a photon energy (or "frequency") of  $a\mathrm{eV}$  has a wavelength (in vacuum) of

$$
\lambda = \frac{h c}{h\nu} = \frac{6.626\times 10^{-34}\mathrm{J}\mathrm{s}\times 2.998\times 10^{8}\mathrm{m} / \mathrm{s}}{a1.6022\times 10^{-19}\mathrm{J}} = \frac{1.240}{a}\mu \mathrm{m}. \tag{1.7}
$$

Since electromagnetic waves of vastly different wavelengths carry vastly different amounts of energy, their behavior is often quite different. Depending on their behavior or occurrence, electromagnetic waves have been grouped into a number of different categories, as shown in Fig. 1- 1. Thermal radiation may be defined to be those electromagnetic waves which are emitted by a medium due solely to its temperature [1]. As indicated earlier, this definition limits the range of wavelengths of importance for heat transfer considerations to between  $0.1\mu \mathrm{m}$  (ultraviolet) and  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  (midinfrared).

# 1.3 BASIC LAWS OF THERMAL RADIATION

When an electromagnetic wave traveling through a medium (or vacuum) strikes the surface of another medium (solid or liquid surface, particle or bubble), the wave may be reflected (either partially or totally), and any nonreflected part will penetrate into the medium. While passing through the medium the wave may become continuously attenuated. If attenuation is complete so that no penetrating radiation reemerges, it is known as opaque. If a wave passes through a medium without any attenuation, it is termed transparent, while a body with partial attenuation is called semitransparent.2 Whether a medium is transparent, semitransparent or opaque depends on the material as well as on its thickness (i.e., the distance the electromagnetic wave must travel through the medium). Metals are nearly always opaque, although it is a

![](images/ae004f6c7757b7d2158a9500c5385fe74298e7be3cf5527e81f3778c4f9c77f0.jpg)  
FIGURE 1-2 Kirchhoff's law.

common high school physics experiment to show that light can penetrate through extremely thin layers of gold. Nonmetals generally require much larger thicknesses before they become opaque, and some are quite transparent over part of the spectrum (for example, window glass in the visible part of the spectrum).

An opaque surface that does not reflect any radiation is called a perfect absorber or a black surface: When we "see" an object, our eyes absorb electromagnetic waves from the visible part of the spectrum, which have been emitted by the sun (or artificial light) and have been reflected by the object toward our eyes. We cannot see a surface that does not reflect radiation, and it appears "black" to our eyes.<sup>3</sup> Since black surfaces absorb the maximum possible amount of radiative energy, they serve as a standard for the classification of all other surfaces.

It is easy to show that a black surface also emits a maximum amount of radiative energy, i.e., more than any other body at the same temperature. To show this, we use one of the many variations of Kirchhoff's law:<sup>4</sup> Consider two identical black- walled enclosures, thermally insulated on the outside, with each containing a small object—one black and the other one not—as shown in Fig. 1- 2. After a long time, in accordance with the Second Law of Thermodynamics, both entire enclosures and the objects within them will be at a single uniform temperature. This characteristic implies that every part of the surface (of the enclosure as well as the objects) emits precisely as much energy as it absorbs. Both objects in the different enclosures receive exactly the same amount of radiative energy. But since the black object absorbs more energy (i.e., the maximum possible), it must also emit more energy than the nonblack object (i.e., also the maximum possible).

By the same reasoning it is easy to show that a black surface is a perfect absorber and emitter at every wavelength and for any direction (of incoming or outgoing electromagnetic waves), and that the radiation field within an isothermal black enclosure is isotropic (i.e., the radiative energy density is the same at any point and in any direction within the enclosure).

# 1.4 EMISSIVE POWER

Every medium continuously emits electromagnetic radiation randomly into all directions at a rate depending on the local temperature and on the properties of the material. This is sometimes referred to as Prévos's law (after Pierre Prévost, an early 19th century Swiss philosopher and physicist). The radiative heat flux emitted from a surface is called the emissive power,  $E$ . We distinguish between total and spectral emissive power (i.e., heat flux emitted over the entire

![](images/c877d969b685e8d4981765b7a378b3db69837e2ecc671e267e9f39d0efc7a123.jpg)

spectrum, or at a given frequency per unit frequency interval), so that spectral emissive power,  $E_{\nu}\equiv$  emitted energy/time/surface area/frequency, total emissive power  $E\equiv$  emitted energy/time/surface area.

Here and elsewhere we use the subscripts  $\nu ,\lambda ,$  or  $\eta$  (depending on the choice of spectral variable) to express a spectral quantity whenever necessary for clarification. Thermal radiation of a single frequency or wavelength is sometimes also called monochromatic radiation (since, over the visible range, the human eye perceives electromagnetic waves to have the colors of the rainbow). It is clear from their definitions that the total and spectral emissive powers are related by

$$
E(T) = \int_0^\infty E_\nu (T,\nu)dv. \tag{1.8}
$$

# Blackbody Emissive Power Spectrum

Blackbody Emissive Power SpectrumScientists had tried for many years to theoretically predict the sun's emission spectrum, which we know today to behave very nearly like a blackbody at approximately 5777 K [2]. The spectral solar flux falling onto Earth, or solar irradiation, is shown in Fig. 1- 3 for extraterrestrial conditions (as measured by high- flying balloons and satellites) and for unity air mass (air mass is defined as the value of  $1 / \cos \theta_{S}$ , where the zenith angle  $\theta_{S}$  is the angle between the local vertical and a vector pointing toward the sun) [3,4]. Solar radiation is attenuated significantly as it penetrates through the atmosphere by phenomena that will be discussed in Sections 1.12 and 1.14. Lord Rayleigh (1900) [5]* and Sir James Jeans (1905) [6]* independently applied the principles of

classical statistics with its equipartition of energy to predict the spectrum of the sun, with dismal results. Wilhelm Wien (1896)  $[7]^{\ddagger}$  used some thermodynamic arguments together with experimental data to propose a spectral distribution of blackbody emissive power that was very accurate over large parts of the spectrum. Finally, in 1901 Max Planck  $[8]^{\S}$  published his work on quantum statistics: Assuming that a molecule can emit photons only at distinct energy levels, he found the spectral blackbody emissive power distribution, now commonly known as Planck's law, for a black surface bounded by a transparent medium with refractive index  $n$ , as

$$
E_{b\nu}(T,\nu) = \frac{2\pi h\nu^3n^2}{c_0^2\left[e^{h\nu / kT} - 1\right]}, \tag{1.9}
$$

where  $k = 1.3807\times 10^{- 23}\mathrm{J / K}$  is known as Boltzmann's constant.4 While frequency  $\nu$  appears to be the most logical spectral variable (since it does not change when light travels from one medium into another), the spectral variables wavelength  $\lambda$  (primarily for surface emission and absorption) and wavenumber  $\eta$  (primarily for radiation in gases) are also frequently (if not more often) employed. Equation (1.9) may be readily expressed in terms of wavelength and wavenumber through the relationships

$$
\nu = \frac{c_0}{n\lambda} = \frac{c_0}{n}\eta ,\qquad d\nu = -\frac{c_0}{n\lambda^2}\left[1 + \frac{\lambda}{n}\frac{dn}{d\lambda}\right]d\lambda = \frac{c_0}{n}\left[1 - \frac{\eta}{n}\frac{dn}{d\eta}\right]d\eta , \tag{1.10}
$$

and

$$
E_{b\nu}(T) = \int_{0}^{\infty}E_{b\nu}d\nu = \int_{0}^{\infty}E_{b\lambda}d\lambda = \int_{0}^{\infty}E_{b\eta}d\eta , \tag{1.11}
$$

or

$$
E_{b\nu}d\nu = -E_{b\lambda}d\lambda = E_{b\eta}d\eta . \tag{1.12}
$$

Here  $\lambda$  and  $\eta$  are wavelength and wavenumber for the electromagnetic waves within the medium of refractive index  $n$  (while  $\lambda_0 = n\lambda$  and  $\eta_0 = \eta /n$  would be wavelength and wavenumber of the same wave traveling through vacuum). Equation (1.10) shows that equation (1.9) gives convenient relations for  $E_{b\nu}$  and  $E_{b\eta}$  only if the refractive index is independent of frequency (or wavelength, or wavenumber). This is certainly the case for vacuum  $(n = 1)$  and ordinary gases  $(n\geq 1)$ , and may be of acceptable accuracy for some semitransparent media over large parts of the spectrum (for example, for quartz  $1.52< n< 1.68$  between the wavelengths of 0.2 and  $2.4\mu \mathrm{m}$ ). Thus, with the assumption of constant refractive index,

$$
E_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda) = \frac{2\pi hc_0^2}{n^2\lambda^5\left[e^{hc_0 / n\lambda kT} - 1\right]}, \tag{n=const},
$$

# $\ddagger$  Wilhelm Wien (1864-1928)

German physicist, who served as professor of physics at the University of Giessen and later at the University of Munich. Besides his research in the area of electromagnetic waves, his interests included other rays, such as electron beams, X- rays, and  $\alpha$ - particles. For the discovery of his displacement law he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1911.

# $\S$  Max Planck (1858-1947)

German physicist. Planck studied in Berlin with H. L. F. von Helmholtz and G. R. Kirchhoff, but obtained his doctorate at the University of Munich before returning to Berlin as professor in theoretical physics. He later became head of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society (today the Max Planck Institute). For his development of the quantum theory he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918.

Equation (1.9) is valid for emission into a medium whose absorptive index (to be introduced in Chapter 2) is much less than the refractive index. This includes semitransparent media such as water, glass, quartz, etc., but not opaque materials. Emission into such bodies is immediately absorbed and is of no interest.

![](images/4654def7c2d3edda32079eb122fc2504e14abf2c43781657011b5ee5801514f9.jpg)  
FIGURE 1-4 Blackbody emissive power spectrum.

$$
E_{b\eta}(T,\eta) = \frac{2\pi hc_0^2\eta^3}{n^2[e^{hc_{0\eta} / nkT} - 1]}, \tag{n=const.}
$$

Figure 1- 4 is a graphical representation of equation (1.13) for a number of blackbody temperatures. As one can see, the overall level of emission rises with rising temperature (as dictated by the Second Law of Thermodynamics), while the wavelength of maximum emission shifts toward shorter wavelengths. The blackbody emissive power is also plotted in Fig. 1- 3 for an effective solar temperature of 5777 K. This plot is in good agreement with extraterrestrial solar irradiation data.

It is customary to introduce the abbreviations

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & C_1 = 2\pi hc_0^2 = 3.7418\times 10^{-16}\mathrm{Wm}^2,\\ & C_2 = hc_0 / k = 14,388\mu \mathrm{mK} = 1.4388\mathrm{cmK}, \end{array}
$$

so that equation (1.13) may be recast as

$$
\frac{E_{b\lambda}}{n^3T^5} = \frac{C_1}{(n\lambda T)^5[e^{C_2 / (n\lambda T)} - 1]},\qquad (n = \mathrm{const}), \tag{1.15}
$$

which is seen to be a function of  $(n\lambda T)$  only. Thus, it is possible to plot this normalized emissive power as a single line vs. the product of wavelength in vacuum  $(n\lambda)$  and temperature  $(T)$ , as shown in Fig. 1- 5, and a detailed tabulation is given in Appendix C. The maximum of this curve may be determined by differentiating equation (1.15),

$$
\frac{d}{d(n\lambda T)}\left(\frac{E_{b\lambda}}{n^3T^5}\right) = 0,
$$

leading to a transcendental equation that may be solved numerically as

$$
(n\lambda T)_{\mathrm{max}} = C_3 = 2898\mu \mathrm{mK}. \tag{1.16}
$$

Equation (1.16) is known as Wien's displacement law since it was developed independently by Wilhelm Wien [9] in 1891 (i.e., well before the publication of Planck's emissive power law).

Example 1.1. At what wavelength has the sun its maximum emissive power? At what wavelength Earth?

![](images/a902e6d9de4b1f60855f61337be6db6ea64ea7425e3d834d2426c34a8b915dfc.jpg)  
FIGURE 1-5 Normalized blackbody emissive power spectrum.

# Solution

From equation (1.16), with the sun's surface at  $T_{\mathrm{sun}} \simeq 5777 \mathrm{~K}$  and bounded by vacuum  $(n = 1)$ , it follows that

$$
\lambda_{\mathrm{max,sun}} = \frac{C_3}{T_{\mathrm{sun}}} = \frac{2898\mu\mathrm{mK}}{5777\mathrm{K}} = 0.50\mu \mathrm{m},
$$

which is near the center of the visible region. Apparently, evolution has caused our eyes to be most sensitive in that section of the electromagnetic spectrum where the maximum daylight is available. In contrast, Earth's average surface temperature may be in the vicinity of  $T_{\mathrm{Earth}} = 290 \mathrm{~K}$ , or

$$
\lambda_{\mathrm{max,Earth}}\simeq \frac{2898\mu\mathrm{mK}}{290\mathrm{K}} = 10\mu \mathrm{m},
$$

that is, Earth's maximum emission occurs in the intermediate infrared, leading to infrared cameras and detectors for night "vision."

It is of interest to look at the asymptotic behavior of Planck's law for small and large wavelengths. For very small values of  $hc_0 / n \lambda kT$  (large wavelength, or small frequency), the exponent in equation (1.13) may be approximated by a two- term Taylor series, leading to

$$
E_{b\lambda} = \frac{2\pi c_0kT}{n\lambda^4},\qquad \frac{hc_0}{n\lambda kT}\ll 1. \tag{1.17}
$$

The same result is obtained if one lets  $h \to 0$ , i.e., if one allows photons of arbitrarily small energy content to be emitted, as postulated by classical statistics. Thus, equation (1.17) is identical to the one derived by Rayleigh and Jeans and bears their names. The Rayleigh- Jeans distribution is also included in Fig. 1- 5. Obviously, this formula is accurate only for very large values of  $(n \lambda T)$ , where the energy of the emissive power spectrum is negligible. Thus, this formula is of little significance for engineering purposes.

For large values of  $(hc_0 / n \lambda kT)$  the  $- 1$  in the denominator of equation (1.13) may be neglected, leading to Wien's distribution (or Wien's law),

$$
E_{b\lambda}\simeq \frac{2\pi hc_0^2}{n^2\lambda^5} e^{-hc_0 / n\lambda kT} = \frac{C_1}{n^2\lambda^5} e^{-C_2 / n\lambda T},\qquad \frac{hc_0}{n\lambda kT}\gg 1, \tag{1.18}
$$

since it is identical to the formula first proposed by Wien, before the advent of quantum mechanics. Examination of Wien's distribution in Fig. 1- 5 shows that it is very accurate over most

of the spectrum, with a total energy content of the entire spectrum approximately  $8\%$  lower than for Planck's law. Thus, Wien's distribution is frequently utilized in theoretical analyses in order to facilitate integration.

# Total Blackbody Emissive Power

The total emissive power of a blackbody may be determined from equations (1.11) and (1.13) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{E_b(T) = \int_0^\infty E_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda)d\lambda = C_1n^2 T^4\int_0^\infty \frac{d(n\lambda T)}{(n\lambda T)^3[e^{C_2 / n\lambda T}} -1]}\\ {= [\frac{C_1}{C_2^4}\int_0^\infty \frac{\xi^3d\xi}{e^\xi - 1}]n^2 T^4,(n = \mathrm{const}).} \end{array} \tag{1.19}
$$

The integral in this expression may be evaluated by complex integration, and is tabulated in many good integral tables:

$$
E_{b}(T) = n^{2}\sigma T^{4},\quad \sigma = \frac{\pi^{4}C_{1}}{15C_{2}^{4}} = 5.670\times 10^{-8}\frac{W}{\mathrm{m}^{2}\mathrm{K}^{4}}, \tag{1.20}
$$

where  $\sigma$  is known as the Stefan- Boltzmann constant.* If Wien's distribution is to be used then the  $- 1$  is absent from the denominator of equation (1.19), and a corrected Stefan- Boltzmann constant should be employed, evaluated as

$$
\sigma_{w} = \frac{6C_{1}}{C_{2}^{4}} = 5.239\times 10^{-8}\frac{W}{m^{2}\mathrm{K}^{4}}, \tag{1.21}
$$

indicating that Wien's distribution underpredicts total emissive power by about  $7.5\%$ . Historically, the  $T^4$  radiation law," equation (1.20), predates Planck's law and was found through thermodynamic arguments. A short history may be found in [10].

It is often necessary to calculate the emissive power contained within a finite wavelength band, say between  $\lambda_{1}$  and  $\lambda_{2}$ . Then

$$
\int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2}E_{b\lambda}d\lambda = \frac{C_1}{C_2^4}\int_{C_2 / n\lambda_2T}^{C_2 / n\lambda_1T}\frac{\xi^3d\xi}{e^\xi - 1} n^2 T^4. \tag{1.22}
$$

It is not possible to evaluate the integral in equation (1.22) in simple analytical form. Therefore, it is customary to express equation (1.22) in terms of the fraction of blackbody emissive power contained between 0 and  $n\lambda T$ ,

$$
f(n\lambda T) = \frac{\int_{0}^{\lambda}E_{b\lambda}d\lambda}{\int_{0}^{\infty}E_{b\lambda}d\lambda} = \int_{0}^{n\lambda T}\left(\frac{E_{b\lambda}}{n^3\sigma T^3}\right)d(n\lambda T) = \frac{15}{\pi^4}\int_{C_2 / n\lambda T}^{\infty}\frac{\xi^3d\xi}{e^\xi - 1}. \tag{1.23}
$$

# Ludwig Erhard Boltzmann (1844-1906)

Austrian physicist. After receiving his doctorate from the University of Vienna he held professorships in Vienna, Graz (both in Austria), Munich, and Leipzig (in Germany). His greatest contributions were in the field of statistical mechanics (Boltzmann statistics). He derived the fourth- power law from thermodynamic considerations in 1889.

so that

$$
\int_{\lambda_1}^{\lambda_2}E_{b\lambda}d\lambda = \left[f(n\lambda_2T) - f(n\lambda_1T)\right]n^2\sigma T^4. \tag{1.24}
$$

Equation (1.23) can be integrated only after expanding the denominator into an infinite series, resulting in

$$
f(n\lambda T) = \frac{15}{\pi^{4}}\sum_{m = 1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-m\zeta}}{m^{4}}\left[6 + 6(m\zeta) + 3(m\zeta)^{2} + (m\zeta)^{3}\right],\quad \zeta = \frac{C_{2}}{n\lambda T}. \tag{1.25}
$$

The fractional emissive power is a function in a single variable,  $n\lambda T,$  and is therefore easily tabulated, as has been done in Appendix C. For computer calculations a little Fortran routine of equation (1.25), bbfn, is given in Appendix F, as well as a stand- alone program, p1anck, which, after inputting wavelength (or wavenumber) and temperature, returns  $E_{b\lambda},E_{b\eta},$  and  $f$

Example 1.2. What fraction of total solar emission falls into the visible spectrum (0.4 to  $0.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  -

# Solution

With  $n = 1$  and a solar temperature of  $5777\mathrm{K}$  it follows that for  $\lambda_{1} = 0.4\mu \mathrm{m},n\lambda_{1}T_{\mathrm{sun}} = 1\times 0.4\times 5777 =$ $2310.8\mu \mathrm{mK};$  and for  $\lambda_{2} = 0.7\mu \mathrm{m},n\lambda_{2}T_{\mathrm{sun}} = 4043.9\mu \mathrm{mK}$  .From Appendix C we find  $f(n\lambda_{1}T_{\mathrm{sun}}) =$  0.12220 and  $f(n\lambda_{2}T_{\mathrm{sun}}) = 0.48869$  . Thus, from equations (1.20) and (1.24) the visible fraction of sunlight is

$$
f(n\lambda_{2}T_{\mathrm{sun}}) - f(n\lambda_{1}T_{\mathrm{sun}}) = 0.48869 - 0.12220 = 0.36649.
$$

(Writing a one- line program bbfn(4043.9)- bbfn(2310.8) returns the slightly more accurate value of 0.36661. ) Therefore, with a bandwidth of only  $0.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  the human eye responds to approximately  $37\%$  of all emitted sunlight!

# 1.5 SOLID ANGLES

When radiative energy leaves one medium and enters another (i.e., emission from a surface into another medium), this energy flux usually has different strengths in different directions. Similarly, the electromagnetic wave, or photon, flux passing through any point inside any medium may vary with direction. It is customary to describe the direction vector in terms of a spherical or polar coordinate system. Consider a point  $P$  on an opaque surface  $dA$  radiating into another medium, say air, as shown in Fig. 1- 6. It is apparent that the surface can radiate into infinitely many directions, with every ray penetrating through a hemisphere of unit radius as indicated in the figure. The total surface area of this hemisphere,  $2\pi 1^2 = 2\pi$ , is known as the

total solid angle above the surface. An arbitrary emission direction from the surface is specified by the unit direction vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , which may be expressed in terms of the polar angle  $\theta$  (measured from the surface normal  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ ) and the azimuthal angle  $\psi$  (measured between an arbitrary axis on the surface and the projection of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  onto the surface). It is seen that, for a hemisphere,  $0 \leq \theta \leq \pi /2$  and  $0 \leq \psi \leq 2\pi$ .

The solid angle with which an infinitesimal surface  $dA_{j}$  is seen from a point  $P$  is defined as the projection of the surface onto a plane normal to the direction vector, divided by the square of the distance  $S$  between  $dA_{j}$  and  $P$ , as also shown in Fig. 1- 6. If the surface is projected onto the unit hemisphere above the point, the solid angle is equal to the projected area itself, or

$$
d\Omega = \frac{dA_{jp}}{S^2} = \frac{\cos\theta_jdA_j}{S^2} = dA_j^{\prime \prime}. \tag{1.26}
$$

Thus, an infinitesimal solid angle is simply an infinitesimal area on a unit sphere, or

$$
d\Omega = dA_j^{\prime \prime} = (1\times \sin \theta d\psi)(1\times d\theta) = \sin \theta d\theta d\psi . \tag{1.27}
$$

Integrating over all possible directions we obtain

$$
\int_{\psi = 0}^{2\pi}\int_{\theta = 0}^{\pi /2}\sin \theta d\theta d\psi = 2\pi , \tag{1.28}
$$

for the total solid angle above the surface, as already seen earlier. The solid angle, with which a finite surface  $A_{j}$  is seen from point  $P$ , follows immediately from equation (1.26) as

$$
\Omega = \int_{A_{jp}}\frac{dA_{jp}}{S^2} = \int_A\frac{\cos\theta_jdA_j}{S^2} = \int_{A_j}dA_j^{\prime \prime} = A_j^{\prime \prime}, \tag{1.29}
$$

i.e., the projection of  $A_{j}$  onto the hemisphere above  $P$ .

While a little unfamiliar at first, solid angles are simply two- dimensional angular space: Similar to the way a one- dimensional angle can vary between 0 and  $\pi$  (measured in dimensionless radians, equivalent to length along a semicircular line), the solid angle may vary between 0 and  $2\pi$  (measured in dimensionless steradians, sr, equivalent to surface area on a hemisphere).

Example 1.3. Determine the solid angle with which the sun is seen from Earth.

# Solution

The area of the sun projected onto a plane normal to the vector pointing from Earth to the sun (or, simply, the image of the sun that we see from Earth) is a disk of radius  $R_{s} \simeq 6.96 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m}$  (i.e., the radius of the sun), at a distance of approximately  $S_{ES} \simeq 1.496 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{~m}$  (averaged over Earth's yearly orbit). Thus the solid angle of the sun is

$$
\Omega_{S} = \frac{(\pi R_{S}^{2})}{S_{ES}^{2}} = \frac{\pi\times(6.955\times 10^{8})^{2}}{(1.496\times 10^{11})^{2}} = 6.79\times 10^{-5}\mathrm{sr}.
$$

This solid angle is so small that we may generally assume that solar radiation comes from a single direction, i.e., that all the light beams are parallel.

Example 1.4. What is the solid angle with which the narrow strip shown in Fig. 1- 7 is seen from point "0"?

# Solution

Since the strip is narrow we may assume that the projection angle for equation (1.29) varies only in the  $x$ - direction as indicated in Fig. 1- 7, leading to

$$
\Omega = w\int_{0}^{L}\frac{\cos\theta_{0}dx}{r^{2}},\qquad \cos \theta_{0} = \frac{h}{r},\qquad r^{2} = h^{2} + x^{2},
$$

$$

# 1.6 RADIATIVE INTENSITY

While emissive power appears to be the natural choice to describe radiative heat flux leaving a surface, it is inadequate to describe the directional dependence of the radiation field, in particular inside an absorbing/emitting medium, where photons may not have originated from a surface. Therefore, very similar to the emissive power, we define the radiative intensity  $I$ , as radiative energy flow per unit solid angle and unit area normal to the rays (as opposed to surface area). Again, we distinguish between spectral and total intensity. Thus, spectral intensity,  $I_{\lambda}\equiv$  radiative energy flow/time/area normal to rays/solid angle/wavelength, total intensity,  $I\equiv$  radiative energy flow/time/area normal to rays/solid angle.

Again, spectral and total intensity are related by

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}},\lambda)d\lambda . \tag{1.30}
$$

Here,  $\mathbf{r}$  is a position vector fixing the location of a point in space, and  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  is a unit direction vector as defined in the previous section. While emissive power depends only on position and wavelength, the radiative intensity depends, in addition, on the direction vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ . The emissive power can be related to intensity by integrating over all the directions pointing away from the surface. Considering Fig. 1- 8, we find that the emitted energy from  $dA$  into the direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , and contained within an infinitesimal solid angle  $d\Omega = \sin \theta d\theta d\psi$  is, from the definition of intensity,

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})dA_p d\Omega = I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})dA\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\psi ,
$$

where  $dA_{p}$  is the projected area of  $dA$  normal to the rays (i.e., the way  $dA$  is seen when viewed from the  $- \hat{\mathbf{s}}$  direction). Thus, integrating this expression over all possible directions gives the

![](images/2418105bd6173e1193cfcbc09965622c226a214f83d4ab4b2d768b3954d6856f.jpg)  
FIGURE 1-9 Kirchhoff's law for the directional behavior of blackbody intensity.

total energy emitted from  $dA$ , or, after dividing by  $dA$

$$
E(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi /2}I(\mathbf{r},\theta ,\psi)\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\psi = \int_{2\pi}I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega . \tag{1.31}
$$

This expression is, of course, also valid on a spectral basis.

The directional behavior of the radiative intensity leaving a blackbody is easily obtained from a variation of Kirchhoff's law: Consider a small, black surface suspended at the center of an isothermal spherical enclosure, as depicted in Fig. 1- 9. Let us assume that the enclosure has a (hypothetical) surface coating that reflects all incoming radiation totally and like a mirror everywhere except over a small area  $dA_{s}$ , which also reflects all incoming radiation except for a small wavelength interval between  $\lambda$  and  $\lambda + d\lambda$ . Over this small range of wavelengths  $dA_{s}$  behaves like a blackbody. Now, all radiation leaving  $dA$ , traveling to the sphere (with the exception of light of wavelength  $\lambda$  traveling toward  $dA_{s}$ ), will be reflected back toward  $dA$  where it will be absorbed (since  $dA$  is black). Thus, the net energy flow from  $dA$  to the sphere is, recalling the definitions for intensity and solid angle,

$$
I_{b\lambda}(T,\theta ,\psi ,\lambda)(dA\cos \theta)d\Omega_{s}d\lambda = I_{b\lambda}(T,\theta ,\psi ,\lambda)(dA\cos \theta)\left(\frac{dA_{s}}{R^{2}}\right)d\lambda ,
$$

where  $d\Omega_{s}$  is the solid angle with which  $dA_{s}$  is seen from  $dA$ . On the other hand, also by Kirchhoff's law, the sphere does not emit any radiation (since it does not absorb anything), except over  $dA_{s}$  at wavelength  $\lambda$ . All energy emitted from  $dA_{s}$  will eventually come back to itself except for the fraction intercepted by  $dA$ . Thus, the net energy flow from the sphere to  $dA$  is

$$
I_{bn\lambda}(T,\lambda)dA_s d\Omega d\lambda = I_{bn\lambda}(T,\lambda)dA_s\left(\frac{dA\cos\theta}{R^2}\right)d\lambda ,
$$

where the subscript  $n$  denotes emission into the normal direction ( $\theta_{s} = 0$ ,  $\psi_{s}$  arbitrary), and  $d\Omega$  is the solid angle with which  $dA$  is seen from  $dA_{s}$ . Now, from the Second Law of Thermodynamics, these two fluxes must be equal for an isothermal enclosure. Therefore,

$$
I_{b\lambda}(T,\theta ,\psi ,\lambda) = I_{bn\lambda}(T,\lambda).
$$

Since the direction ( $\theta$ ,  $\psi$ ), with which  $dA_{s}$  is oriented, is quite arbitrary we conclude that  $I_{b\lambda}$  is independent of direction, or

$$
I_{b\lambda} = I_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda)\mathrm{only}. \tag{1.32}
$$

FIGURE 1-10 Radiative heat flux on an arbitrary surface.

Substituting this expression into equation (1.31) we obtain the following relationship between blackbody intensity and emissive power:

$$
E_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) = \pi I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda). \tag{1.33}
$$

This equation implies that the intensity leaving a blackbody (or any surface whose outgoing intensity is independent of direction, or diffuse) may be evaluated from the blackbody emissive power (or outgoing heat flux) as

$$
I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) = E_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) / \pi . \tag{1.34}
$$

In the literature the spectral blackbody intensity is sometimes referred to as the Planck function. The directional behavior of the emission from a blackbody is found by comparing the intensity (energy flow per solid angle and area normal to the rays) and directional emitted flux (energy flow per solid angle and per unit surface area). The directional heat flux is sometimes called directional emissive power, and

$$
E_{b\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\theta ,\psi)dA = I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda)dA_{p},
$$

or

$$
E_{b\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\theta ,\psi) = I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda)\cos \theta , \tag{1.35}
$$

that is, the directional emitted flux of a blackbody varies with the cosine of the polar angle. This is sometimes referred to as Lambert's law* or the cosine law.

# 1.7 RADIATIVE HEAT FLUX

Consider the surface shown in Fig. 1- 10. Let thermal radiation from an infinitesimal solid angle around the direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  impinge onto the surface with an intensity of  $I_{\lambda}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)$ . Such radiation is often called a "pencil of rays" since the infinitesimal solid angle is usually drawn looking like the tip of a sharpened pencil. Recalling the definition for intensity we see that it imparts an infinitesimal heat flow rate per wavelength on the surface in the amount of

$$
d\Omega_{\lambda} = I_{\lambda}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)d\Omega_idA_p = I_{\lambda}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)d\Omega_i(dA\cos \theta_i),
$$

where heat rate is taken as positive in the direction of the outward surface normal (going into the medium), so that the incoming flux going into the surface is negative since  $\cos \theta_i < 0$ . Integrating

over all  $2\pi$  incoming directions and dividing by the surface area gives the total incoming heat flux per unit wavelength, i.e.,

$$
(q_{\lambda})_{\mathrm{in}} = \int_{\cos \theta_i< 0}I_{\lambda}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\cos \theta_id\Omega_i. \tag{1.36}
$$

Heat loss from the surface, along a pencil of rays into the direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o$ , and integrated over all outgoing directions, follows as

$$
(q_{\lambda})_{\mathrm{out}} = \int_{\cos \theta_o > 0}I_{\lambda}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o)\cos \theta_id\Omega_o. \tag{1.37}
$$

If the surface is black  $(\epsilon_{\lambda} = 1)$ , there is no energy reflected from the surface and  $I_{\lambda} = I_{b\lambda}$ , leading to  $(q_{\lambda})_{\mathrm{out}} = E_{b\lambda}$ . If the surface is not black, the outgoing intensity consists of contributions from emission as well as reflections. The outgoing heat flux is positive since it is going into the medium. The net heat flux from the surface may be calculated by adding both contributions, or

$$
(q_{\lambda})_{\mathrm{net}} = (q_{\lambda})_{\mathrm{in}} + (q_{\lambda})_{\mathrm{out}} = \int_{4\pi}I_{\lambda}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})\cos \theta d\Omega , \tag{1.38}
$$

where a single direction vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  was used to describe the total range of solid angles,  $4\pi$ . It is readily seen from Fig. 1- 10 that  $\cos \theta = \hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}$  and, since the net heat flux is evaluated as the flux into the positive  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ - direction, one gets

$$
(q_{\lambda})_{\mathrm{net}} = \mathbf{q}_{\lambda}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \int_{4\pi}I_{\lambda}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega . \tag{1.39}
$$

In order to obtain the total radiative heat flux at the surface, equation (1.39) needs to be integrated over the spectrum, and

$$
\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \int_{0}^{\infty}\mathbf{q}_{\lambda}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} d\lambda = \int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{4\pi}I_{\lambda}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega d\lambda . \tag{1.40}
$$

Example 1.5. A solar collector mounted on a satellite orbiting Earth is directed at the sun (i.e., normal to the sun's rays). Determine the total solar heat flux incident on the collector per unit area.

# Solution

The total heat rate leaving the sun is  $\dot{Q}_S = 4\pi R_S^2 E_b(T_S)$ , where  $R_S\simeq 6.96\times 10^8\mathrm{m}$  is the radius of the sun. Placing an imaginary spherical shell around the sun of radius  $S_{ES} = 1.496\times 10^{11}\mathrm{m}$ , where  $S_{ES}$  is the distance between the sun and Earth, we find the heat flux going through that imaginary sphere (which includes the solar collector) as

$$
q_{\mathrm{sol}} = \frac{4\pi R_S^2E_b(T_S)}{4\pi S_{\mathrm{sol}}^2} = I_b(T_S)\frac{\pi R_S^2}{S_{\mathrm{sol}}^2} = I_b(T_S)\Omega_S,
$$

where we have replaced the sun's emissive power by intensity,  $E_{b} = \pi I_{b}$ , and  $\Omega_{S} = 6.79\times 10^{- 5}\mathrm{sr}$  is the solid angle with which the sun is seen from Earth, as determined in Example 1.3. Therefore, with  $I_{b}(T_{S}) = \sigma T_{S}^{4} / \pi$  and  $T_{S} = 5777\mathrm{K}$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q_{\mathrm{in}} = -(\sigma T_S^4 /\pi)(\Omega_S) = -\frac{1}{\pi} 5.670\times 10^{-8}\times 5777^4\times 6.79\times 10^{-5}\mathrm{W / m^2}}\\ {= -1366\mathrm{W / m^2},} \end{array}
$$

where we have added a minus sign to emphasize that the heat flux is going into the collector. The total incoming heat flux may, of course, also be determined from equation (1.36) as

$$
q_{\mathrm{in}} = \int_{\cos \theta_i< 0}I(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\cos \theta_id\Omega_i.
$$

Since light from the sun arrives only from the extremely small solid angle of  $\Omega_{S}$  (over which  $\cos \theta_{i} \simeq - 1$ ), the integral may be written as

$$
q_{\mathrm{in}} = I_i\times (-1)\times \Omega_S.
$$

Comparing this with the previous expression we see that the incoming solar intensity at the collector,  $I_{i},$  is identical to the intensity leaving from the sun's surface,  $I_{b}(T_{S})$  . This invariability property of radiative intensity as it travels through vacuum will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 10.

Solar Constant. The absolute value of the heat flux determined in the previous example is known as the solar constant. In reality, however, solar irradiation onto the surface of the Earth varies continuously, exhibiting variations on all time scales, from minutes to decades. The most prominent feature is its annual fluctuation due to Earth's varying distance from the Sun (with a maximum of about  $1412\mathrm{W / m^2}$  in early January, and a minimum of about  $1321\mathrm{W / m^2}$  in early July; a variation of approximately  $\pm 3.4\%$ ). Accurate satellite- based observations have also confirmed an 11- year cycle due to cyclical solar activity, with annual averages varying between approximately  $1365.6\mathrm{W / m^2}$  and  $1366.7\mathrm{W / m^2}$  (or  $\pm 0.04\%$ ) [11,12]. The generally accepted annual mean value for the 'solar constant' appears to be

$$
q_{\mathrm{sol}} = 1366\mathrm{W / m}^2, \tag{1.41}
$$

and is qualitatively indicated in Fig. 1- 3. The effective solar temperature of  $T = 5777\mathrm{K}$  has been determined by working Example 1.5 in reverse.

# 1.8 RADIATION PRESSURE

If we think of radiative energy as photons or (massless) particles carrying an energy of  $h\nu$  and traveling at the speed of light  $c$  into a certain direction, then these particles should carry momentum in the amount of energy/speed  $= h\nu /c = h\eta$  (even though they do not possess mass). Therefore, if photons hit a material surface a momentum transfer takes place, which implies that a stream of photons exerts pressure on the walls of a container, known as radiation pressure or photon pressure.

Consider a monochromatic beam of intensity  $I_{\lambda}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)$  incident on a surface element  $dA$  from a direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  and over a solid angle  $d\Omega_{i}$ . The energy flow incident on  $dA$  due to this beam is  $I_{\lambda}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\cos \theta_i dA d\Omega_i$ . Therefore, the beam carries with it momentum at a rate of

$$
\frac{1}{c} I_{\lambda}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)|\cos \theta_i|dAd\Omega_i\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,
$$

where the unit vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  has been added to emphasize that the momentum flow is a vector pointing into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$ . The fraction of momentum falling onto  $dA$  in the normal direction is  $|\cos \theta_i| = |\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i|$ . Therefore, the flow of momentum onto  $dA$  in the normal direction is, per unit area,

$$
\frac{1}{c} I_{\lambda}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\cos^2\theta_id\Omega_i.
$$

According to Newton's Second Law the total momentum flux normal to the surface, due to irradiation from all possible directions, must be counteracted by a pressure force  $p_{\lambda} dA$  leading to a spectral radiation pressure

$$
p_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{c}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}I_{\lambda}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})\cos^{2}\theta \sin \theta d\theta d\psi . \tag{1.42}
$$

As for other spectral properties, a total radiation pressure is defined as

$$
p = \int_0^\infty p_\lambda d\lambda . \tag{1.43}
$$

Example 1.6. A very light spacecraft had been entered in the Columbus Competition (which was originally scheduled for 1992, the 500th anniversary of Columbus' discovery of the New World, but which was eventually cancelled for lack of funds), whose goal was to sail the craft to Mars, using solar radiation pressure as the only propellant. Assuming a black sail and a necessary pushing force of  $100\mathrm{N}$ , determine the necessary surface area for the solar sail.

# Solution

The solar pressure exerted on the sail may be calculated from equation (1.42). As in the previous example solar radiation is incident over an extremely small solid angle,  $\Omega_{S} = 6.79\times 10^{- 5}\mathrm{sr}$ . Thus, the solar pressure may be evaluated as

$$
p = \frac{1}{c}\frac{\sigma T_S^4}{\pi} (-1)^2\Omega_S = \frac{q_{\mathrm{sol}}}{c} = \frac{1366\mathrm{W / m^2}}{2.998\times 10^8\mathrm{m / s}} = 4.56\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{W s / m^3} = 4.56\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{N / m^2}.
$$

The total force on the sail is  $F = pA$ , so that a force of  $100\mathrm{N}$  would require a sail area of  $A = 100 / 4.56\times 10^{- 6} = 22\times 10^{6}\mathrm{m}^{2} = 22\mathrm{km}^{2}$ .

Note that, for a perfectly reflecting sail, the reflected intensity would be equal to the incoming intensity, but in the opposite direction with  $\cos \theta = +1$ . The contribution to the radiation pressure would be positive again, doubling the pressure to  $9\times 10^{- 6}\mathrm{N}$  and halving the necessary sail area to  $11\mathrm{km}^2$ .

This example demonstrates that radiation pressure, while measurable and nonnegligible for some applications, can certainly not compete with the pressure exerted by a molecular gas.

# 1.9 VISIBLE RADIATION (LUMINANCE)

Because of the great importance of visible radiation, and since much of the theory developed in this book is directly applicable to lighting design calculations, we shall very briefly discuss the nature of electromagnetic waves as perceived by the human eye. For a more detailed treatment of lighting, the reader should refer to books on the subject, such as the ones by Moon [13] and by Hopkinson and coworkers [14], or the IES (Illuminating Engineering Society) Handbook [15].

When electromagnetic waves of spectral intensity  $I_{\lambda}$  fall onto the human eye, a certain fraction of the intensity is observed as "light," known as spectral luminance,

$$
L_{\lambda} = K_{\lambda}I_{\lambda}, \tag{1.44}
$$

where the proportionality factor  $K_{\lambda}$  is called the luminous efficacy. Spectral luminance is measured in lumen per unit wavelength, per unit solid angle, and per unit area normal to the rays  $(\mathrm{lm} / \mathrm{m}^2\mu \mathrm{msr})$ . Therefore, the units of the luminous efficacy are  $\mathrm{lm} / \mathrm{W}$ . Luminance may also be measured using candelas (cd), lux (lx) or lamberts (L), where the different units are related by

$$
1\mathrm{L} = \frac{1}{\pi}\mathrm{cd} / \mathrm{cm}^2,1\mathrm{cd} = 1\mathrm{lm} / \mathrm{sr},1\mathrm{lx} = 1\mathrm{lm} / \mathrm{m}^2.
$$

The average human eye responds to radiation in the wavelength interval between  $\sim 0.4\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $0.7\mu \mathrm{m}$ , and  $K_{\lambda}$  thus vanishes outside this range. A standard luminous efficacy to approximate the average human eye was set by the CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage or International Commission on Illumination) in 1924 and is shown in Fig. 1- 11. Also shown is the standard luminous efficiency, defined as

$$
\eta_{\mathrm{lum},\lambda} = K_{\lambda} / K_{\mathrm{max}};K_{\mathrm{max}} = K_{\lambda}(\lambda = 0.555\mu \mathrm{m}) = 683\mathrm{lm} / \mathrm{W}, \tag{1.45}
$$

where  $K_{\mathrm{max}}$  is the spectral maximum of  $K_{\lambda}$ , which occurs (for the standard) at  $\lambda = 0.555\mu \mathrm{m}$ . The total luminance is calculated from

$$
L = \int_0^\infty K_\lambda I_\lambda d\lambda , \tag{1.46}
$$

![](images/af47a596979e1016c95c0ab2e38839f00aa69546f8c6ec275b95d6312449dc18.jpg)  
FIGURE 1-11 CE standards for luminous efficiency and luminous efficacy.

which—if  $I_{\lambda}$  does not vary too much over the interval  $0.4\mu \mathrm{m} < \lambda < 0.7\mu \mathrm{m}$ —may be approximated as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{L\simeq I_{\lambda}(\lambda = 0.555\mu \mathrm{m})K_{\mathrm{max}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\eta_{\mathrm{lum},\lambda}d\lambda}\\ {\simeq 86\frac{\mathrm{lm}\mu\mathrm{m}}{\mathrm{W}}\times I_{\lambda}(\lambda = 0.555\mu \mathrm{m})\simeq 286\frac{\mathrm{lm}}{\mathrm{W}}\int_{0.4\mu \mathrm{m}}^{0.7\mu \mathrm{m}}I_{\lambda}d\lambda ,} \end{array} \tag{1.47}
$$

where  $86\mathrm{lm}\mu \mathrm{m} / \mathrm{W}$  is the area underneath the luminous efficiency in Fig. 1- 11, and  $286\mathrm{lm} / \mathrm{W}$  is an appropriate average value for  $K_{\lambda}$ .

Example 1.7. On a clear day the strength of solar radiation has been measured as  $q_{\mathrm{sun}} = 800\mathrm{W / m}^2$  (normal to the sun's rays), while total sky radiation (from all directions), falling onto a horizontal surface, has been determined as  $q_{\mathrm{sky}} = 200\mathrm{W / m}^2$ . Determine the luminous flux, or illumination, onto a horizontal surface if the sun is at a zenith angle of  $60^{\circ}$ .

# Solution

Similar to the radiative heat flux, the luminous flux onto a surface is defined as

$$
q_{\mathrm{lum}} = \int_{2\pi}L(\hat{\mathbf{s}})\cos \theta d\Omega .
$$

Therefore, from equations (1.46) and (1.47)

$$
q_{\mathrm{lum}} = \int_{2\pi}286\frac{\mathrm{lm}}{\mathrm{W}}\int_{0.4\mu \mathrm{m}}^{0.7\mu \mathrm{m}}I_{\lambda}d\lambda \cos \theta d\Omega = 286\frac{\mathrm{lm}}{\mathrm{W}}\int_{0.4\mu \mathrm{m}}^{0.7\mu \mathrm{m}}\int_{2\pi}I_{\lambda}\cos \theta d\Omega = 286\frac{\mathrm{lm}}{\mathrm{W}}\int_{0.4\mu \mathrm{m}}^{0.7\mu \mathrm{m}}q_{\lambda}d\lambda ,
$$

where  $q_{\lambda}$  is the total spectral irradiation from the sun and the sky. Since both contributions are due to solar emission (either by direct travel or after atmospheric scattering), we may write  $q_{\lambda} = (q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \theta_{\mathrm{sun}} + q_{\mathrm{sky}})E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{sun}}) / E_{b}(T_{\mathrm{sun}})$ , or

$$
q_{\mathrm{lum}} = 286\frac{\mathrm{lm}}{\mathrm{W}} (q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \theta_{\mathrm{sun}} + q_{\mathrm{sky}})\left[f(0.7\mu \mathrm{m}T_{\mathrm{sun}}) - f(0.4\mu \mathrm{m}T_{\mathrm{sun}})\right],
$$

or, with  $T_{\mathrm{sun}} = 5777\mathrm{K}$ ,

$$
q_{\mathrm{lum}} = 286\frac{\mathrm{lm}}{\mathrm{W}}\left(860\times \frac{1}{2} +200\right)\frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2} [0.48869 - 0.12220] = 62,890\mathrm{lm} / \mathrm{m}^2 = 62,890\mathrm{lx}.
$$

Actually, for the visible wavelengths a solar temperature of  $T_{\mathrm{sun}} = 5777\mathrm{K}$  is not very accurate (cf. Fig. 1- 3) so usually a solar temperature of  $6500\mathrm{K}$  is employed for luminance calculations. With such a temperature  $f(0.7\times 6500\mu \mathrm{mK}) - f(0.4\times 6500\mu \mathrm{mK}) = 0.57177 - 0.18311$  and

$$
q_{\mathrm{lum}}\simeq 66,694\mathrm{lx}.
$$

All relationships for radiative intensity and radiative heat flux that will be developed in this book may also be used to determine luminance and luminous flux simply by using units of lumens instead of watts.

# 1.10 RADIATIVE INTENSITY IN VACUUM

Before we discuss how radiative intensity is affected by absorption, emission, and scattering, it is important to understand how intensity penetrates through a vacuum. When discussing emission from a black surface we noticed that the concept of intensity had one advantage over emissive power, namely, that the emitted intensity did not vary with direction. Within a medium, the definition of an emissive power is not applicable since there is no surface to which to relate it. The intensity, defined as radiative energy transferred per unit time, solid angle, spectral variable, and area normal to the pencil of rays, is the most appropriate variable to describe the radiative transfer within a medium.

Consider radiative intensity penetrating at normal angle through a (fictitious) infinitesimal area  $dA_{1}$ , at location  $s_{1}$  and time  $t_{1}$ , as shown in the sketch of Fig. 1- 12. Based on the definition of intensity, we see that the amount of energy passing through  $dA_{1}$  over a duration  $dt$  and spectral range  $d\eta$  that will—a little later—fall onto the infinitesimal surface  $dA_{2}$ , is

$$
I_{\eta}(s_1,t_1)dt d\Omega_{1\rightarrow 2}d\eta dA_1 = I_{\eta}(s_1,t_1)dt\frac{dA_2}{(s_2 - s_1)^2} d\eta dA_1,
$$

where  $d\Omega_{1\rightarrow 2}$  is the solid angle with which  $dA_{2}$  is seen from an observer on  $dA_{1}$ . Since it takes the radiation until the time  $t_2 = t_1 + (s_2 - s_1) / c$  to travel from  $s_{1}$  to  $s_{2}$ , we can say that the energy going through  $dA_{2}$  that is coming from  $dA_{1}$  is

$$
I_{\eta}(s_2,t_2)dt d\Omega_{2\rightarrow 1}d\eta dA_2 = I_{\eta}(s_2,t_2)dt\frac{dA_1}{(s_2 - s_1)^2} d\eta dA_2.
$$

Since both energies must be equal, we conclude that

$$
I_{\eta}(s_2,t_1 + (s_2 - s_1) / c) = I_{\eta}(s_1,t_1). \tag{1.48}
$$

Since the speed of light is so large in comparison with nearly every time scale in engineering problems, we may almost always assume that the radiative energy arrives "instantaneously" everywhere in the medium, i.e.,

$$
I_{\eta}(s_2) = I_{\eta}(s_1), \tag{1.49}
$$

or

$$
I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \mathrm{const}. \tag{1.50}
$$

Therefore, within a medium that does not emit, absorb, or scatter radiation (known as a "non- participating medium"), the radiative intensity in any given direction is constant along its path.

![](images/1206e507b5baab04651519d7a2afaaf12f2d7f08e7f688153513c171036c610d.jpg)  
FIGURE 1-13 Absorption, reflection, and transmission by a slab.

Conversely, in a "participating medium" (a medium that does absorb, emit, and/or scatter) any changes in intensity along any given path must be due to one or more of these phenomena.

# 1.11 INTRODUCTION TO RADIATION CHARACTERISTICS OF OPAQUE SURFACES

We have already noted that thermal radiation, unlike conduction and convection, is a long- range phenomenon. When making an energy balance for a point in space we must account for all photons that may arrive at this point, no matter from how far away. Thus, a conservation of energy balance must be performed on an enclosure bounded by opaque walls (i.e., a medium thick enough that no electromagnetic waves can penetrate through it). Strictly speaking, the surface of an enclosure wall can only reflect radiative energy or allow a part of it to penetrate into the substrate. A surface cannot absorb or emit photons: Attenuation takes place inside the solid, as does emission of radiative energy (and some of the emitted energy escapes through the surface into the enclosure). In practical systems the thickness of the surface layer over which absorption of irradiation from inside the enclosure occurs is very small compared with the overall dimensions of an enclosure—usually a few  $\mathring{\mathrm{A}}$  for metals and a few  $\mu \mathrm{m}$  for most nonmetals. The same may be said about emission from within the walls that escapes into the enclosure. Thus, in the case of opaque walls it is customary to speak of absorption by and emission from a "surface," although a thin surface layer is implied.

Consider thermal radiation impinging on a medium of finite thickness, as shown in Fig. 1- 13. In general, some of the irradiation will be reflected away from the medium, a fraction will be absorbed inside the layer, and the rest will be transmitted through the slab. Based on this observation we define three fundamental radiative properties:5

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\mathrm{Reflectance,}\quad \rho \equiv \frac{\mathrm{reflected~part~of~in~coming~radiation}}{\mathrm{total~in~coming~radiation}},}\\ & {\mathrm{Absorption,}\quad \alpha \equiv \frac{\mathrm{absorbed~part~of~in~coming~radiation}}{\mathrm{total~in~coming~radiation}},}\\ & {\mathrm{Transmittance,}\quad \tau \equiv \frac{\mathrm{transmitted~part~of~in~coming~radiation}}{\mathrm{total~in~coming~radiation}}.} \end{array} \tag{1.51a}
$$

![](images/ec08e3f0dfb43251642cd1878ed660b07a590a9a4bf3aee5426820bb14686ea8.jpg)  
FIGURE 1-14 Normal, spectral emittances for selected materials, from [16].

Since all radiation must be either reflected, absorbed, or transmitted, we conclude

$$
\rho +\alpha +\tau = 1. \tag{1.52}
$$

If the medium is sufficiently thick to be opaque, then  $\tau = 0$  and

$$
\rho +\alpha = 1. \tag{1.53}
$$

We note that all three of these properties are nondimensional and may vary in magnitude between the values 0 and 1. Since a black surface absorbs all incoming radiation it follows for such a surface that  $\alpha = 1$  and  $\rho = \tau = 0$

All surfaces also emit thermal radiation (or, rather, radiative energy is emitted within the medium, some of which escapes from the surface). Since we know that, at a given temperature, the maximum possible is emitted by a black surface, we define a fourth nondimensional property:

$$
E m i t t a n c e,\epsilon = \frac{e n e r g y e m i t t e d f r o m a s u r f a c e}{e n e r g y e m i t t e d b y a b l a c k s u r f a c e a t s a m e t e m p e r a t u r e}. \tag{1.54}
$$

The emittance can, therefore, also vary between the values of 0 and 1, and for a black surface we have  $\epsilon = 1$

All four properties may be functions of temperature as well as of wavelength (or frequency). The absorptance may be different for different directions of irradiation, while emittance may vary with outgoing directions. Finally, the magnitude of reflectance and transmittance may depend on both incoming and outgoing directions. Thus, we distinguish between spectral and total properties (i.e., an average value over the spectrum), and between directional and hemispherical properties (i.e., an average value over all directions).

Typical spectral behavior of surface emittances is shown in Fig. 1- 14 for a few materials, as collected by White [16]. Shown are values for directional emittances in the direction normal to the surface. However, the spectral behavior is similar to hemispherical emittances (i.e., emittances averaged over all directions). In general, nonmetals have relatively high emittances, which may vary erratically across the spectrum, and metals behave similarly for short wavelengths but tend to have lower emittances with more regular spectral dependence in the infrared. A more detailed description of the definitions, evaluation, and measurement of radiative surface properties is given in Chapter 3.

FIGURE 1-15 Spectral lines due to electronic, vibrational, and rotational energy changes in a gas molecule.

# 1.12 INTRODUCTION TO RADIATION CHARACTERISTICS OF GASES

Like a solid medium (or the thin layer next to its surface), gases can absorb and emit radiative energy. All gas atoms or molecules carry a certain amount of energy, consisting of kinetic energy (translational energy of a molecule) and energy internal to each molecule. The internal molecular energy, in turn, consists of a number of contributions, primarily of the levels of electronic, vibrational, and rotational energy states. Thus, a passing photon may be absorbed by a molecule raising the level of one of the internal energy states. On the other hand, a molecule may spontaneously release (emit) a photon in order to lower one of its internal energy states.

Quantum mechanics postulates that only a finite number of discrete energy levels are possible, i.e., that electrons can circle around the nucleus only on a number of allowed orbits, vibration between nuclei can only occur with a number of distinct frequencies, and the nuclei can rotate around one another only with a number of allowed rotational velocities. Therefore, changing the internal energy of a molecular gas can only destroy or generate photons with very distinct energy levels  $h\nu$  and, consequently, only at distinct frequencies or wavelengths. It takes a relatively large amount of energy to change the orbit of an electron, giving rise to absorption- emission lines in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum, but generally only at extremely high temperatures rarely encountered in engineering. In the case of a monatomic gas only the electronic energy level can be altered by a photon. Changing the vibrational energy level of a molecule requires an intermediate amount of energy, resulting in spectral lines in the near to intermediate infrared  $(1\mu \mathrm{m}\lesssim \lambda \lesssim 15\mu \mathrm{m})$ . Finally, rotational energy changes take place with an even smaller amount of energy, so that rotational lines are found in the intermediate to far infrared  $(\lambda \gtrsim 10\mu \mathrm{m})$ . Usually, vibrational energy changes are accompanied by simultaneous changes in rotational energy levels, so that the vibrational lines are surrounded by many rotational lines, as illustrated in Fig. 1- 15. Similarly, electronic transitions in molecules are accompanied by many different vibrational and rotational energy changes.

Unless the temperature of a gas is extremely high, the gas will essentially be free of ions and free electrons. In this case, absorption or emission of photons results in bound- bound transitions (i.e., there is no ionization before and after the transition), and discrete spectral lines, as shown in Fig. 1- 15. If absorption of a photon results in ionization and the release of an electron, the transition is termed bound- free. Conversely, a free electron may combine with an ion in a free- bound transition, producing a photon. Finally, a free electron can absorb or emit photons, resulting in free- free transitions. Since an electron can have arbitrary kinetic energy, all transitions involving free electrons are not limited to discrete wavelengths and produce continuous spectra.

In reality, not even the lines from bound- bound transitions are truly discrete, but are broad-

ened slightly. The rotational lines accompanying a vibrational transition usually overlap, forming what is termed vibration- rotation bands, as also indicated in Fig. 1- 15.

As radiative energy penetrates through a gas layer it gradually becomes attenuated by absorption. Experience (and theoretical development) shows that this absorption leads to an exponential decay of incident radiation, so that the transmissivity of a homogeneous isothermal gas layer may be written as

$$
\tau_{\eta} = e^{-\kappa_{\eta}s}, \tag{1.55}
$$

where  $s$  is the thickness of the gas layer and the proportionality constant  $\kappa_{\eta}$  is known as the absorption coefficient. The exponential decay of incident radiation is also commonly called Beer's law. In the expression for transmissivity we have used the wavenumber  $\eta$  as the spectral variable, since the wavenumber is commonly chosen by researchers working in the field of gas radiation. Since, in the case of a gas layer, incident radiation is either transmitted or absorbed, we define the spectral absorptivity of a gas layer as

$$
\alpha_{\eta} = 1 - \tau_{\eta} = 1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}s}. \tag{1.56}
$$

Figure 1- 16 shows a typical absorption spectrum for a nitrogen- carbon dioxide mixture, taken from the early work of Edwards [17]. The formation of vibration- rotation bands in the infrared due to bound- bound transitions, separated by spectral windows, is clearly visible. The line structure is lost in this figure, partly because of the aforementioned line broadening, which tends to be strong for high pressures, and partly because of poor spectral resolution in these old measurements.

Not all gases have vibration- rotation bands. In particular, dry air (i.e., nitrogen and oxygen) at moderate temperature does not absorb or emit radiation in the infrared. Radiative properties of gases are described in much more detail in Chapter 11.

# 1.13 INTRODUCTION TO RADIATION CHARACTERISTICS OF SOLIDS AND LIQUIDS

There are a number of liquid and solid substances that absorb radiative energy only gradually, such that these materials cannot be approximated as "opaque surfaces." They are known

FIGURE 1-17 Spectral absorption coefficient of window glass, from Neuroth [18].

as semitransparent. Typical examples for the visible part of the spectrum are water, glass, quartz, etc. Absorption and emission of photons in liquids are due to interactions with free electrons, and within solids due to interactions with free electrons as well as due to excitation of lattice vibrations (phonons). Consequently, semitransparent materials are always poor electric conductors (few free electrons). The absorption behavior of these materials is qualitatively similar to that of dissociated gases (free- free transitions for the electrons), with the possibility of strong absorption bands due to photon- phonon interactions. As an example the absorption coefficient for window glass is shown in Fig. 1- 17, taken from measurements by Neuroth [18]. A slightly more detailed discussion of the radiative properties of semitransparent media is given in Chapter 13.

# 1.14 INTRODUCTION TO RADIATION CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICLES

The interaction between photons, or electromagnetic waves, and small particles is somewhat different from that with a homogeneous gas, liquid, or solid. As for a homogeneous medium, radiation traveling through a particle cloud may be transmitted, reflected, or absorbed. In addition, interaction with a particle may change the direction in which a photon travels, as schematically shown in Fig. 1- 18. This can occur by one of three different mechanisms: (i) The path of a photon may be altered, without ever colliding with the particle, by diffraction, (ii) a photon may change its direction by reflection from the particle, and (iii) the photon may penetrate into the particle, changing its direction because of refraction. All three phenomena together are known as the scattering of radiation. Absorption takes place as the electromagnetic wave penetrates into the particle. Therefore, in the presence of scattering, the equation for transmissivity of a material layer, equation (1.55), must be augmented to

$$
\tau_{\eta} = e^{-(\kappa_{\eta} + \sigma_{s\eta})s} = e^{-\beta_{\eta}s}, \tag{1.57}
$$

where  $\sigma_{s\eta}$  is known as the scattering coefficient and  $\beta_{\eta} = \kappa_{\eta} + \sigma_{s\eta}$  as the extinction coefficient. Scattered rays travel on unattenuated, and the probability that a ray from one direction will be scattered into a certain other direction by an angle  $\theta$  is described by the scattering phase function,

![](images/e082cc4c0aae4b8aab8590416ad73e193cffd2e43bf40937495ac6dbf47df395.jpg)  
FIGURE 1-18 Interaction of electromagnetic waves with small particles.

$\Phi_{\eta}$ . It is also common practice to introduce the single scattering albedo, defined as

$$
\omega_{\eta}\equiv \frac{\sigma_{s\eta}}{\kappa_{\eta} + \sigma_{s\eta}} = \frac{\sigma_{s\eta}}{\beta_{\eta}}, \tag{1.58}
$$

which gives the relative importance of scattering: a medium that does not scatter at all has  $\omega = 0$ , while  $\omega = 1$  indicates a pure scatterer (nonabsorbing).

The nature of the interaction between electromagnetic waves and particles is determined by the relative size of the particles compared with the wavelength of the radiation. Defining a size parameter

$$
x = \frac{2\pi a}{\lambda}, \tag{1.59}
$$

where  $a$  is the effective radius of the particle, we distinguish among three different regimes:

1.  $x\ll 1$ , or Rayleigh scattering, named after Lord Rayleigh, who studied the interaction of atmospheric air (whose molecules are, in fact, very small particles) with sunlight [19]. He observed that, for very small particles, scattering is proportional to  $\nu^4$  or  $1 / \lambda^4$ . Thus, within the visible part of the spectrum, blue light is scattered the most (accounting for blue skies) and red the least (resulting in red sunsets). 
2.  $x = \mathcal{O}(1)$ , or Mie scattering, named after Gustav Mie, who developed a comprehensive (and difficult) theory for the interaction between electromagnetic waves and particles [20]. 
3.  $x\gg 1$ . In this case the surface of the particle may be treated as a normal surface, and properties may be found through geometric optics.

A more detailed discussion of the radiative properties of particles is given in Chapter 12.

# 1.15 THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER EQUATION

To determine the radiative flux onto a surface (or at any point inside the medium) requires knowledge of the radiative intensity at that point, for all directions and for all wavelengths or wavenumbers. The intensity field inside a participating medium is governed by the radiative transfer equation, which is a radiative energy balance along a thin pencil of rays, as was done in Section 1.10, but now for a medium that emits, absorbs, and/or scatters radiation. This equation, which will be rigorously developed in Chapter 10, states that, along a line of sight into the direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , the spectral radiative intensity changes according to

$$
\frac{dI_{\eta}}{ds} = \kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta} - \kappa_{\eta}I_{\eta} - \sigma_{s\eta}I_{\eta} + \frac{\sigma_{s\eta}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega_i. \tag{1.60}
$$

The terms on the right- hand- side indicate how, along a path  $s$ , the intensity is augmented by emission  $(\kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta})$  and decreased by absorption  $(\kappa_{\eta}I_{\eta})$  and by scattering away from  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ $(\sigma_{s\eta}I_{\eta})$ .

![](images/59a1c8084f72d684175221800b1d19ccd6651621f5b728b493508e15f7aaf3dd.jpg)  
FIGURE 1-19 Intensity variation inside a participating medium.

Scattered radiation is simply channeled into other directions and, thus, the last term in equation (1.60) is the increase of intensity due to radiation from other directions (the scattering phase function  $\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}})$  gives the probability that a ray coming from  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  is scattered toward  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ ). We note that if  $\kappa_{\eta} = \sigma_{s\eta} = 0$  (nonparticipating medium) equation (1.60) reduces to equation (1.50):

$$
\frac{dI_{\eta}}{ds} = 0\quad \mathrm{or}\quad I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \mathrm{const.} \tag{1.61}
$$

To better distinguish between attenuation and augmentation of radiation, we may introduce the source function for radiative intensity,

$$
S_{\eta}(s,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = (1 - \omega_{\eta})I_{b\eta} + \frac{\omega_{\eta}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega_{i}, \tag{1.62}
$$

where we have used the single scattering albedo  $\omega$ , defined by equation (1.58). This simplifies the radiative transfer equation, commonly abbreviated as RTE, to

$$
\frac{dI_{\eta}}{ds} = \beta_{\eta}[S_{\eta}(s,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) - I_{\eta}]. \tag{1.63}
$$

Its formal solution is readily found, and for the special case of a spatially invariant extinction coefficient,  $\beta_{\eta} = \mathrm{const}$ , follows as

$$
I_{\eta}(s) = I_{\eta}(0)e^{-\beta_{\eta}s} + \int_{0}^{s}S_{\eta}(s^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}})e^{-\beta_{\eta}(s - s^{\prime})}\beta_{\eta}ds^{\prime}. \tag{1.64}
$$

The local intensity at  $s$  consists of two parts (cf. Fig. 1- 19): (i) intensity entering the medium at  $s = 0$  (say, from a bounding wall) attenuated by absorption and out- scattering from 0 to  $s$ , and (ii) increase of intensity along the path at  $s'$  (by emission and/or in- scattering) attenuated along the remaining distance between  $s'$  and  $s$ . It is important to remember that, if the medium scatters  $(\omega > 0)$ , the source function in equation (1.64) contains the radiative intensity at every point along the path, for all possible directions (not just  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ ): the radiative transfer equation, equation (1.60), is an integro- differential equation (intensity appears, both, as a derivative and also inside the integral on the right- hand side) in five dimensions (three space dimensions and two directional coordinates). This makes the RTE extremely difficult to solve, and much of this book will be devoted to describing the various methods of solution that have been devised over the years (Chapters 14- 21).

# 1.16 OUTLINE OF RADIATIVE TRANSPORT THEORY

When considering heat transfer by conduction and/or convection within a medium, we require knowledge of a number of material properties, such as thermal conductivity  $k$ , thermal diffusivity  $\alpha$ , kinematic viscosity  $\nu$ , and so on. This knowledge, together with the law of conservation

of energy, allows us to calculate the energy field within the medium in the form of the basic variable, temperature  $T$ . Once the temperature field is determined, the local heat flux vector may be found from Fourier's law. The evaluation of radiative energy transport follows a similar pattern: Knowledge of radiative properties is required (emittance  $\epsilon$ , absorptance  $\alpha$ , and reflectance  $\rho$ , in the case of surfaces, as well as absorption coefficient  $\kappa$  and scattering coefficient  $\sigma_{s}$  for semitransparent media), and the law of conservation of energy is applied to determine the energy field. Two major differences exist between conduction/convection and thermal radiation that make the analysis of radiative transport somewhat more complex: (i) Unlike their thermophysical counterparts, radiative properties may be functions of direction as well as of wavelength, and (ii) the basic variable appearing in the law of conservation of radiative energy, the radiative transfer equation introduced in the previous section, is not temperature but radiative intensity, which is a function not only of location in space (as is temperature), but also of direction. Only after the intensity field has been determined can the local temperatures (as well as the radiative heat flux vector) be calculated.

Thermal radiation calculations are always performed by making an energy balance for an enclosure bounded by opaque walls (some of which may be artificial to account for radiation penetrating through openings in the enclosure). If the enclosure is evacuated or filled with a nonabsorbing, nonscattering medium (such as air at low to moderate temperatures), we speak of surface radiation transport. If the enclosure is filled with an absorbing gas or a semitransparent solid or liquid, or with absorbing and scattering particles (or bubbles), we refer to it as radiative transport in a participating medium. Of course, radiation in a participating medium is always accompanied by surface radiation transport.

# Problems

1.1 Solar energy impinging on the outer layer of Earth's atmosphere (usually called the "solar constant") has been measured as  $1366\mathrm{W / m^2}$ . What is the solar constant on Mars? (Distance from Earth to sun  $= 1.496\times 10^{11}\mathrm{m}$ , Mars to sun  $= 2.28\times 10^{11}\mathrm{m}$ .)

1.2 Assuming Earth to be a blackbody, what would be its average temperature if there was no internal heating from the core of Earth?

1.3 Assuming Earth to be a black sphere with a surface temperature of  $300\mathrm{K}$ , what must Earth's internal heat generation be in order to maintain that temperature (neglect radiation from the stars, but not the sun) (radius of the Earth  $R_{E} = 6.37\times 10^{6}\mathrm{m}$ ).

1.4 To estimate the diameter of the sun, one may use solar radiation data. The solar energy impinging onto the Earth's atmosphere (called the "solar constant") has been measured as  $1366\mathrm{W / m^2}$ . Assuming that the sun may be approximated to have a black surface with an effective temperature of  $5777\mathrm{K}$ , estimate the diameter of the sun (distance from sun to Earth  $S_{ES}\simeq 1.496\times 10^{11}\mathrm{m}$ ).

1.5 Solar energy impinging on the outer layer of Earth's atmosphere (usually called the "solar constant") has been measured as  $1366\mathrm{W / m^2}$ . Assuming the sun may be approximated as having a surface that behaves like a blackbody, estimate its effective surface temperature (distance from sun to Earth  $S_{ES}\simeq 1.496\times 10^{11}\mathrm{m}$ , radius of sun  $R_{S}\simeq 6.96\times 10^{8}\mathrm{m}$ ).

1.6 A rocket in space may be approximated as a black cylinder of length  $L = 20\mathrm{m}$  and diameter  $D = 2\mathrm{m}$ . It flies past the sun at a distance of 140 million km such that the cylinder axis is perpendicular to the sun's rays. Assuming that  $(i)$  the sun is a blackbody at  $5777\mathrm{K}$  and  $(ii)$  the cylinder has a high conductivity (i.e., is essentially isothermal), what is the temperature of the rocket? (Radius of sun  $R_{S} = 696,000\mathrm{km}$ ; neglect radiation from Earth and the stars.)

1.7 A black sphere of very high conductivity (i.e., isothermal) is orbiting Earth. What is its temperature? (Consider the sun but neglect radiation from the Earth and the stars.) What would be the temperature of the sphere if it were coated with a material that behaves like a blackbody for wavelengths between  $0.4\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $3\mu \mathrm{m}$ , but does not absorb and emit at other wavelengths?

1.8 A  $100\mathrm{W}$  lightbulb may be considered to be an isothermal black sphere at a certain temperature. If the light flux (i.e., visible light,  $0.4\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < 0.7\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) impinging on the floor directly  $(2.5\mathrm{m})$  below the bulb is  $42.6\mathrm{mW / m^2}$ , and assuming conduction/convection losses to be negligible, what is the lightbulb's effective temperature? What is its efficiency?

1.9 When a metallic surface is irradiated with a highly concentrated laser beam, a plume of plasma (i.e., a gas consisting of ions and free electrons) is formed above the surface that absorbs the laser's energy, often blocking it from reaching the surface. Assume that a plasma of  $1\mathrm{cm}$  diameter is located  $1\mathrm{cm}$  above the surface, and that the plasma behaves like a blackbody at  $20,000\mathrm{K}$ . Based on these assumptions calculate the radiative heat flux and the total radiation pressure on the metal directly under the center of the plasma.

1.10 Solar energy incident on the surface of the Earth may be broken into two parts: a direct component (traveling unimpeded through the atmosphere) and a sky component (reaching the surface after being scattered by the atmosphere). On a clear day the direct solar heat flux has been determined as  $q_{\mathrm{sun}} = 1000\mathrm{W / m^2}$  (per unit area normal to the rays), while the intensity of the sky component has been found to be diffuse (i.e., the intensity of the sky radiation hitting the surface is the same for all directions) and  $I_{\mathrm{sky}} = 70\mathrm{W / m^2}$  sr. Determine the total solar irradiation onto Earth's surface if the sun is located  $60^{\circ}$  above the horizon (i.e.,  $30^{\circ}$  from the normal).

1.11 A window (consisting of a vertical sheet of glass) is exposed to direct sunshine at a strength of  $1000\mathrm{W / m^2}$ . The window is pointing due south, while the sun is in the southwest,  $30^{\circ}$  above the horizon. Estimate the amount of solar energy that  $(i)$  penetrates into the building,  $(ii)$  is absorbed by

the window, and  $(iii)$  is reflected by the window. The window is made of  $(a)$  plain glass,  $(b)$  tinted glass, whose radiative properties may be approximated by

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\rho_{\lambda} = 0.08\quad \mathrm{for~all~wavelengths~(both~glass)}}\\ & {\tau_{\lambda} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0.90 & \mathrm{for~0.35\mu m< \lambda< 2.7\mu m}\\ 0 & \mathrm{for~all~other~wavelengths}\quad \mathrm{(plain~glass)}, \end{array} \right.}\\ & {\tau_{\lambda} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0.90 & \mathrm{for~0.5\mu m< \lambda< 1.4\mu m}\\ 0 & \mathrm{for~all~other~wavelengths}\quad \mathrm{(tinted~glass)}. \end{array} \right.} \end{array}
$$

(c) By what fraction is the amount of visible light  $(0.4\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < 0.7\mu \mathrm{m})$  reduced, if tinted rather than plain glass is used? How would you modify this statement in the light of Fig. 1-11?

1.12 On an overcast day the directional behavior of the intensity of solar radiation reaching the surface of the Earth after being scattered by the atmosphere may be approximated as  $I_{\mathrm{sky}}(\theta) = I_{\mathrm{sky}}(\theta = 0)\cos \theta ,$  where  $\theta$  is measured from the surface normal. For a day with  $I_{\mathrm{sky}}(0) = 100\mathrm{W / m^2}$  sr determine the solar irradiation hitting a solar collector, if the collector is  $(a)$  horizontal,  $(b)$  tilted from the horizontal by  $30^{\circ}$  . Neglect radiation from the Earth's surface hitting the collector (by emission or reflection).

1.13 A 100 W lightbulb is rated to have a total light output of  $1750\mathrm{lm}$  . Assuming the lightbulb to consist of a small, black, radiating body (the light filament) enclosed in a glass envelope (with a transmittance  $\tau_{g} = 0.9$  throughout the visible wavelengths), estimate the filament's temperature. If the filament has an emittance of  $\epsilon_{f} = 0.7$  (constant for all wavelengths and directions), how does it affect its temperature?

1.14 A pyrometer is a device with which the temperature of a surface may be determined remotely by measuring the radiative energy falling onto a detector. Consider a black detector of  $1\mathrm{mm}\times 1\mathrm{mm}$  area that is exposed to a  $1\mathrm{cm}^2$  hole in a furnace located a distance of  $1\mathrm{m}$  away. The inside of the furnace is at  $1500\mathrm{K}$  and the intensity escaping from the hole is essentially blackbody intensity at that temperature.  $(a)$  What is the radiative heat rate hitting the detector?  $(b)$  Assuming that the pyrometer has been calibrated for the situation in  $(a)$  , what temperature would the pyrometer indicate if the nonabsorbing gas between furnace and detector were replaced by one with an (average) absorption coefficient of  $\kappa = 0.1\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$  2

1.15 Consider a pyrometer, which also has a detector area of  $1\mathrm{mm}\times 1\mathrm{mm}$  , which is black in the wavelength range  $1.0\mu \mathrm{m}\leq \lambda \leq 1.2\mu \mathrm{m},$  and perfectly reflecting elsewhere. In front of the detector is a focusing lens  $(f = 10\mathrm{cm})$  of diameter  $D = 2\mathrm{cm},$  and transmissivity of  $\tau_{l} = 0.9$  (around  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$  .In order to measure the temperature inside a furnace, the pyrometer is focused onto a hot black surface inside the furnace, a distance of  $1\mathrm{m}$  away from the lens.

(a) How large a spot on the furnace wall does the detector see? (Remember that geometric optics dictates

$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} +\frac{1}{v};\qquad M = \frac{h(\mathrm{detector~size})}{H(\mathrm{spot~size})} = \frac{v}{h},
$$

where  $u = 1\mathrm{m}$  is the distance from lens to furnace wall, and  $v$  is the distance from lens to detector.)

$(b)$  If the temperature of the furnace wall is  $1200\mathrm{K},$  how much energy is absorbed by the detector per unit time?  $(c)$  It turns out the furnace wall is not really black, but has an emittance of  $\epsilon = 0.7$  (around  $1\mu \mathrm{m})$  Assuming there is no radiation reflected from the furnace surface reaching the detector, what is the true surface temperature for the pyrometer reading of case  $(b)$ $(d)$  To measure higher temperatures pyrometers are outfitted with filters. If a  $\tau_{f} = 0.7$  filter is placed in front of the lens, what furnace temperature would provide the same pyrometer reading as case  $(b)$  2

# CHAPTER 2

# RADIATIVE PROPERTY PREDICTIONS FROM ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE THEORY

# 2.1 INTRODUCTION

The basic radiative properties of surfaces forming an enclosure, i.e., emissivity, absorptivity, reflectivity, and transmissivity, must be known before any radiative heat transfer calculations can be carried out. Many of these properties vary with incoming direction, outgoing direction, and wavelength, and must usually be found through experiment. However, for pure, perfectly smooth surfaces these properties may be calculated from classical electromagnetic wave theory.<sup>1</sup> These predictions make experimental measurements unnecessary for some cases, and help interpolating as well as extrapolating experimental data in many other situations.

The first important discoveries with respect to light were made during the seventeenth century, such as the law of refraction (by Snell in 1621), the decomposition of white light into monochromatic components (by Newton in 1666), and the first determination of the speed of light (by Romer in 1675). However, the true nature of light was still unknown: The corpuscular theory (suggested by Newton) competed with a rudimentary wave theory. Not until the early nineteenth century was the wave theory finally accepted as the correct model for the description of light. Young proposed a model of purely transverse waves in 1817 (as opposed to the model prevalent until then of purely longitudinal waves), followed by Fresnel's comprehensive treatment of diffraction and other optical phenomena. In 1845 Faraday proved experimentally that there was a connection between magnetism and light. Based on these experiments, Maxwell presented in 1861 his famous set of equations for the complete description of electromagnetic waves, i.e., the interaction between electric and magnetic fields. Their success was truly remarkable, in particular because the theories of quantum mechanics and special relativity, with

which electromagnetic waves are so strongly related, were not discovered until half a century later. To this day Maxwell's equations remain the basis for the study of light.*

# 2.2 THE MACROSCOPIC MAXWELL EQUATIONS

The original form of Maxwell's equations is based on electrical experiments available at the time, with their very coarse temporal and spatial resolution. Thus any of these measurements were spatial averages taken over many layers of atoms and temporal averages over many oscillations of an electromagnetic wave. For this reason the original set of equations is termed macroscopic. Today we know that electromagnetic waves interact with matter at the molecular level, with strong field fluctuations over each wave period. Therefore, more detailed treatises on optics and electromagnetic waves now generally start with a microscopic description of the wave equations, for example, the book by Stone [1]. While there is little disagreement in the literature on the microscopic equations, the macroscopic equations often differ somewhat from book to book, depending on assumptions made and constitutive relations used. Following the development of Stone [1], we may state the macroscopic Maxwell equations as

$$
\begin{array}{c}\nabla \cdot (\epsilon \mathbf{E}) = \rho_f,\\ \nabla \cdot (\mu \mathbf{H}) = 0,\\ \nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\mu \frac{\partial\mathbf{H}}{\partial t},\\ \nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \epsilon \frac{\partial\mathbf{E}}{\partial t} +\sigma_e\mathbf{E}, \end{array} \tag{2.4}
$$

where  $\mathbf{E}$  and  $\mathbf{H}$  are the electric field and magnetic field vectors, respectively,  $\epsilon$  is the electrical permittivity,  $\mu$  is the magnetic permeability,  $\sigma_{e}$  is the electrical conductivity, and  $\rho_{f}$  is the charge density due to free electrons, which is generally assumed to be related to the electric field by the equation

$$
\frac{\partial\rho_f}{\partial t} = -\nabla \cdot (\sigma_e\mathbf{E}). \tag{2.5}
$$

The phenomenological coefficients  $\sigma_{e}, \mu ,$  and  $\epsilon$  depend on the medium under consideration, but may be assumed independent of the fields (for a linear medium) and independent of position and direction (for a homogeneous and isotropic medium); they may, however, depend on the wavelength of the electromagnetic waves [2].

# 2.3 ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE PROPAGATION IN UNBOUNDED MEDIA

We seek a solution to the above set of equations in the form of a wave. The most general form of a time- harmonic field (i.e., a wave of constant frequency or wavelength) is

$$
\mathbf{F} = \mathbf{A}\cos \omega t + \mathbf{B}\sin \omega t = \mathbf{A}\cos 2\pi \nu t + \mathbf{B}\sin 2\pi \nu t, \tag{2.6}
$$

where  $\omega$  is the angular frequency (in radians/s), and  $\nu = \omega /2\pi$  is the frequency in cycles per second. While a little less convenient, we will use the cyclical frequency  $\nu$  in the following

development in order to limit the number of different spectral variables employed in this book. When it comes to the time- harmonic solution of linear partial differential equations, it is usually advantageous to introduce a complex representation of the real field. Thus, setting

$$
\mathbf{F}_c = \overline{\mathbf{F}}_ce^{2\pi ivt},\quad \overline{\mathbf{F}}_c = \mathbf{A} - i\mathbf{B}, \tag{2.7}
$$

where  $\overline{\mathbf{F}}_c$  is the time- average of the complex field, results in

$$
\mathbf{F} = \Re \{\mathbf{F}_c\} , \tag{2.8}
$$

where the symbol  $\Re$  denotes that the real part of the complex vector  $\mathbf{F}_c$  is to be taken. Since the Maxwell equations are linear in the fields  $\mathbf{E}$  and  $\mathbf{H}$ , one may solve them for their complex fields, and then extract their real parts after a solution has been found. Therefore, setting

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{E} = \Re \{\mathbf{E}_c\} = \Re \{\overline{\mathbf{E}}_ce^{2\pi ivt}\} ,\\ \mathbf{H} = \Re \{\mathbf{H}_c\} = \Re \{\overline{\mathbf{H}}_ce^{2\pi ivt}\} , \end{array} \tag{2.10}
$$

results in

$$
\begin{array}{r}\nabla \cdot (\gamma \mathbf{E}_c) = 0,\\ \nabla \cdot \mathbf{H}_c = 0,\\ \nabla \times \mathbf{E}_c = -2\pi i\nu \mu \mathbf{H}_c,\\ \nabla \times \mathbf{H}_c = 2\pi i\nu \gamma \mathbf{E}_c, \end{array} \tag{2.11}
$$

where

$$
\gamma = \epsilon -i\frac{\sigma_e}{2\pi\nu} \tag{2.15}
$$

is the complex permittivity. If  $\gamma \neq 0$ , then it can be shown that the solution to the above set of equations must be plane waves, i.e., the electric and magnetic fields are transverse to the direction of propagation (have no component in the direction of propagation). Thus, the solution of equations (2.11) through (2.14) will be of the form

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathbf{E} = \Re \{\overline{\mathbf{E}}_ce^{2\pi ivt}\} = \Re \{\mathbf{E}_0e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)}\} ,}\\ & {\mathbf{H} = \Re \{\overline{\mathbf{H}}_ce^{2\pi ivt}\} = \Re \{\mathbf{H}_0e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)}\} ,} \end{array} \tag{2.16}
$$

where  $\mathbf{r}$  is a vector pointing to an arbitrary point in space,  $\mathbf{w}$  is known as the wave vector and  $\mathbf{E}_0$  and  $\mathbf{H}_0$  are constant vectors. In general  $\mathbf{w}$  is a complex vector,

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{w}^{\prime} - i\mathbf{w}^{\prime \prime}, \end{array} \tag{2.18}
$$

where  $\mathbf{w}'$  turns out to be a vector whose magnitude is the wavenumber, and  $\mathbf{w}''$  is known as the attenuation vector. Employing equation (2.18), equations (2.16) and (2.17) may be rewritten as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{E}_c = \mathbf{E}_0e^{-2\pi \mathbf{w}''\cdot \mathbf{r}}e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}'\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)},\\ \mathbf{H}_c = \mathbf{H}_0e^{-2\pi \mathbf{w}''\cdot \mathbf{r}}e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}'\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)}. \end{array} \tag{2.19}
$$

Thus, the complex electric and magnetic fields have local amplitude vectors  $\mathbf{E}_0e^{- 2\pi \mathbf{w}''\cdot \mathbf{r}}$  and  $\mathbf{H}_0e^{- 2\pi \mathbf{w}''\cdot \mathbf{r}}$  and an oscillatory part  $e^{- 2\pi i(\mathbf{w}'\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)}$  with phase angle  $\phi = 2\pi (\mathbf{w}'\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)$ . The position vector  $\mathbf{r}$  may be considered to have two components: one parallel to  $\mathbf{w}'$ , and the other perpendicular to it. The vector product  $\mathbf{w}'\cdot \mathbf{r}$  is constant for all vectors  $\mathbf{r}$  that have the same component parallel to  $\mathbf{w}'$ , i.e., on planes normal to the vector  $\mathbf{w}'$ ; these planes are known as planes of equal phase. To see how the wave travels let us look at the phase angle at two different times and locations (Fig. 2- 1). First, consider the point  $\mathbf{r} = 0$  at time  $t = 0$  with a zero phase

![](images/c8089844316d53115dc3898fa5603e5b7fb6b0540209c63ed1fe7f10e6be27e9.jpg)  
FIGURE 2-1 Phase propagation of an electromagnetic wave.

angle. Second, consider another point a distance  $\mathcal{Z}$  away into the direction of  $\mathbf{w}^{\prime}$ ; we see that the phase angle is zero at that point when  $t = |\mathbf{w}^{\prime}|z / \nu$ . Thus, the phase velocity with which the wave travels from one point to the other is  $c = z / t = \nu /w^{\prime}$ . We conclude that the wave propagates into the direction of  $\mathbf{w}^{\prime}$ , and that the vector's magnitude,  $w^{\prime}$ , is equal to the wavenumber  $\eta$ . Examining the amplitude vectors we see that  $\mathbf{w}^{\prime \prime}\cdot \mathbf{r} =$  const are planes of equal amplitude, and that the amplitude of the fields diminishes into the direction of  $\mathbf{w}^{\prime \prime}$ . If planes of equal phase and equal amplitude coincide (i.e., if  $\mathbf{w}^{\prime}$  and  $\mathbf{w}^{\prime \prime}$  are parallel) we say the wave is homogeneous, otherwise the wave is said to be inhomogeneous. Since  $\mathbf{E}_0$  and  $\mathbf{w}$  are independent of position, we can substitute equation (2.19) into equation (2.11) and, assuming  $\gamma$  to be also invariant with space, find that

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\nabla \cdot (\gamma \mathbf{E}_c) = \gamma \nabla \cdot \left(\mathbf{E}_0e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)}\right) = \gamma \mathbf{E}_0\cdot \nabla \left(e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)}\right)}\\ & {\qquad = \gamma \mathbf{E}_0e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)}\cdot \nabla (-2\pi i\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{r}) = -2\pi i\gamma \mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{E}_0e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)} = 0.} \end{array} \tag{2.21}
$$

Similarly, substituting equation (2.19) into equation (2.13) results in

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\nabla \times \mathbf{E}_c = \nabla \times \left(\mathbf{E}_0e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)}\right) = \nabla \left(e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)}\right)\times \mathbf{E}_0}\\ & {\qquad = -2\pi i\mathbf{w}e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)}\times \mathbf{E}_0 = -2\pi i\nu \mu \mathbf{H}_0e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)}.} \end{array} \tag{2.22}
$$

Thus, the partial differential equations (2.11) through (2.14) may be replaced by a set of algebraic equations,

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{E}_0 = 0,}\\ & {\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{H}_0 = 0,}\\ & {\mathbf{w}\times \mathbf{E}_0 = \nu \mu \mathbf{H}_0,}\\ & {\mathbf{w}\times \mathbf{H}_0 = -\nu \gamma \mathbf{E}_0.} \end{array} \tag{2.25}
$$

It is clear from equations (2.23) and (2.24) that both  $\mathbf{E}_0$  and  $\mathbf{H}_0$  are perpendicular to  $\mathbf{w}$ , and it follows then from equations (2.25) and (2.26) that they are also perpendicular to each other. If the wave is homogeneous, then  $\mathbf{w}$  points into the direction of wave propagation, and the electric and magnetic fields lie in planes perpendicular to this direction, as indicated in Fig. 2- 2.

It remains to relate the complex wave vector  $\mathbf{w}$  to the properties of the medium. Taking the vector product of equation (2.25) with  $\mathbf{w}$  and recalling the vector identity derived, for example, in Wylie [3],

$$
\mathbf{A}\times (\mathbf{B}\times \mathbf{C}) = \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{C}) - \mathbf{C}(\mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{B}), \tag{2.27}
$$

FIGURE 2-2 Electric and magnetic fields of a homogeneous wave.

which leads to

$$
\mathbf{w}\times (\mathbf{w}\times \mathbf{E}_0) = \mathbf{w}(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{E}_0) - \mathbf{E}_0\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{w} = \nu \mu \mathbf{w}\times \mathbf{H}_0 = -\nu^2\mu \gamma \mathbf{E}_0,
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{w} = \nu^2\mu \gamma . \tag{2.28}
$$

If the wave travels through vacuum there can be no attenuation  $(\mathbf{w}^{\prime \prime} = 0)$  and  $\mu = \mu_0$ ,  $\gamma = \epsilon_0$ . We thus obtain the speed of light in vacuum as

$$
c_{0} = \nu /\upsilon^{\prime} = \nu /\sqrt{\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{w}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{0}\mu_{0}}}. \tag{2.29}
$$

It is customary to introduce the complex index of refraction

$$
m = n - ik \tag{2.30}
$$

into equation (2.28) such that

$$
\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{w} = \nu^2\mu \gamma = \nu^2\epsilon_0\mu_0\left(\frac{\epsilon\mu}{\epsilon_0\mu_0} -i\frac{\sigma_\epsilon\mu}{2\pi\nu\epsilon_0\mu_0}\right) = \eta_0^2 m^2, \tag{2.31}
$$

where  $\eta_0 = \nu /c_0$  is the wavenumber of a wave with frequency  $\nu$  and phase velocity  $c_0$ , i.e., of a wave traveling through vacuum. This definition of  $m$  demands that

$$
n^2 -k^2 = \frac{\epsilon\mu}{\epsilon_0\mu_0} = \epsilon \mu c_0^2, \tag{2.32}
$$

$$
n k = \frac{\sigma_{\epsilon}\mu}{4\pi\nu\epsilon_{0}\mu_{0}} = \frac{\sigma_{\epsilon}\mu\lambda_{0}c_{0}}{4\pi}, \tag{2.33}
$$

where  $\lambda_0 = 1 / \eta_0 = c_0 / \nu$  is the wavelength for the wave in vacuum. Equations (2.32) and (2.33) may be solved for the refractive index  $n$  and the absorptive index  $^4 k$  as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{n^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0} +\sqrt{\left(\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\lambda_0\sigma_e}{2\pi c_0\epsilon_0}\right)^2}\right],}\\ {k^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left[-\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0} +\sqrt{\left(\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\lambda_0\sigma_e}{2\pi c_0\epsilon_0}\right)^2}\right],} \end{array} \tag{2.34}
$$

where we have assumed the material to be nonmagnetic, or  $\mu = \mu_0$ . These relations do not reveal the frequency (wavelength) dependence of the complex index of refraction, since the phenomenological coefficients  $\epsilon$  and  $\sigma_{e}$  may depend on frequency. If the wave is homogeneous, the wave vector may be written as  $\mathbf{w} = (w' - iw'')\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , where  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  is a unit vector in the direction of wave propagation, and it follows from equation (2.31) that  $w' - iw'' = \eta_0(n - ik)$ , so that the electric and magnetic fields reduce to

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{E}_c = \mathbf{E}_0e^{-2\pi \eta_0kz}e^{-2\pi i\eta_0n(z - c_0t / n)},\\ \mathbf{H}_c = \mathbf{H}_0e^{-2\pi \eta_0kz}e^{-2\pi i\eta_0n(z - c_0t / n)}, \end{array} \tag{2.36}
$$

where  $z = \hat{\mathbf{s}} \cdot \mathbf{r}$  is distance along the direction of propagation. For a nonvacuum, the phase velocity  $c$  of an electromagnetic wave is<sup>5</sup>

$$
c = \frac{c_0}{n}. \tag{2.38}
$$

Further, the field strengths decay exponentially for nonzero values of  $k$ ; thus, the absorptive index gives an indication of how quickly a wave is absorbed within the medium. Inspection of equation (2.35) shows that a large absorptive index  $k$  corresponds to a large electrical conductivity  $\sigma_{e}$ : Electromagnetic waves tend to be attenuated rapidly in good electrical conductors, such as metals, but are often transmitted with weak attenuation in media with poor electrical conductivity, or dielectrics, such as glass.

The magnitude and direction of the transfer of electromagnetic energy is given by the Poynting vector, i.e., a vector of magnitude  $EH$  pointing into the direction of propagation (cf. Fig. 2- 2),<sup>6</sup>

$$
\mathbf{S} = \mathbf{E}\times \mathbf{H} = \Re \{\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{c}}\} \times \Re \{\mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{c}}\} . \tag{2.39}
$$

The instantaneous value for the Poynting* vector is a rapidly varying function of time. Of greater value to the engineer is a time- averaged value of the Poynting vector, say

$$
\overline{\mathbf{S}} = \frac{1}{\delta t}\int_t^{t + \delta t}\mathbf{S}(t)dt, \tag{2.40}
$$

where  $\delta t$  is a very small amount of time, but significantly larger than the duration of a period,  $1 / \nu$ ; since  $\mathbf{S}$  repeats itself after each period (if no attenuation occurs) a  $\delta t$  equal to any multiple of  $1 / \nu$  will give the same result for  $\overline{\mathbf{S}}$ , namely

$$
\begin{array}{r}\overline{\mathbf{S}} = \frac{1}{2}\Re \{\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{c}}\times \mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{c}}\} , \end{array} \tag{2.41}
$$

where  $\mathbf{H}^{*}$  denotes the complex conjugate of  $\mathbf{H}$ , and the factor of  $1 / 2$  results from integrating over  $\cos^{2}(2\pi \eta_{0}c_{0}t)$  and  $\sin^{2}(2\pi \eta_{0}c_{0}t)$  terms. Thus using equation (2.25) and the vector identity (2.27), the Poynting vector may be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\overline{\mathbf{S}} = \frac{1}{2\nu\mu}\Re \{\mathbf{E}_c\times (\mathbf{w}^*\times \mathbf{E}_c^*)\} = \frac{1}{2\nu\mu}\Re \{\mathbf{w}^* (\mathbf{E}_c\cdot \mathbf{E}_c^*)\} \\ \displaystyle = \frac{n}{2c_0\mu} |\mathbf{E}_0|^2 e^{-4\pi \eta_0kz}\hat{\mathbf{s}}. \end{array} \tag{2.42}
$$

The vector  $\mathbf{S}$  points into the direction of propagation, and—as the wave traverses the medium—its energy content is attenuated exponentially, where the attenuation factor

$$
\kappa = 4\pi \eta_0k \tag{2.43}
$$

is known as the absorption coefficient of the medium.

Example 2.1. A plane homogeneous wave propagates through a perfect dielectric medium  $(n = 2)$  in the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} = 0.8\hat{\mathbf{i}} +0.6\hat{\mathbf{k}}$  with a wavenumber of  $\eta_0 = 2500\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  and an electric field amplitude vector of  $\mathbf{E}_0 = E_0[(6 + 3i)\hat{\mathbf{i}} +(2 - 5i)\hat{\mathbf{j}} -(8 + 4i)\hat{\mathbf{k}} ] / \sqrt{154},$  where  $E_0 = 600\mathrm{N / C},$  and the  $\hat{\mathbf{I}},\hat{\mathbf{J}},$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{k}}$  are unit vectors in the  $x = y =$  and  $\Xi$  - directions. Determine the magnetic field amplitude vector and the energy contained in the wave, assuming that the medium is nonmagnetic.

# Solution

Since  $\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{w}^{\prime}$  is colinear with  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , we find from equation (2.31) that  $\mathbf{w} = w\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \eta_0w\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  and, from equation (2.25),

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathbf{H}_0 = \frac{1}{\nu\mu}\mathbf{w}\times \mathbf{E}_0 = \frac{1}{\nu\mu_0}\mathbf{w}\times \mathbf{E}_0 = \frac{n}{c_0\mu_0}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\times \mathbf{E}_0}\\ {= \frac{nE_0}{c_0\mu_0\sqrt{154}}\left| \begin{array}{ccc}\hat{\mathbf{i}} & \hat{\mathbf{j}} & \hat{\mathbf{k}}\\ 0.8 & 0.0 & 0.6\\ 6 + 3i & 2 - 5i & -8 - 4i \end{array} \right|}\\ {= \frac{nE_0}{c_0\mu_05\sqrt{154}} [(-6 + 15i)\hat{\mathbf{i}} +(50 + 25i)\hat{\mathbf{j}} +(8 - 20i)\hat{\mathbf{k}} ]}\\ {= \frac{H_0}{\sqrt{3850}} [(-6 + 15i)\hat{\mathbf{i}} +(50 + 25i)\hat{\mathbf{j}} +(8 - 20i)\hat{\mathbf{k}} ],} \end{array}
$$

where

$$
H_{0} = \frac{nE_{0}}{c_{0}\mu_{0}} = \frac{2\times 600\mathrm{N / C}}{2.998\times 10^{8}\mathrm{m / s}\times 4\pi\times 10^{-7}\mathrm{Ns}^{2} / \mathrm{C}^{2}} = 3.185\mathrm{C / m s},
$$

and it is assumed that, for a nonmagnetic medium, the magnetic permeability is equal to the one in vacuum,  $\mu = \mu_{0}$  (from Table A.1). The energy content of the wave is given by the Poynting vector, either equation (2.41) or equation (2.42). Choosing the latter, we get

$$
\overline{\mathbf{S}} = \frac{n}{2c_0\mu_0} E_0^2\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \overline{S}\hat{\mathbf{s}},\qquad \overline{S} = \frac{2\times 600^2\mathrm{N}^2 / \mathrm{C}^2}{2\times 2.2998\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{m / s}\times 4\pi\times 10^{-7}\mathrm{Ns}^2 / \mathrm{C}^2} = 955.6\mathrm{W / m}^2.
$$

# 2.4 POLARIZATION

Knowledge of the frequency, direction of propagation, and the energy content [i.e., the magnitude of the Poynting vector, equation (2.42)] does not completely describe a monochromatic (or time- harmonic) electromagnetic wave. Every train of electromagnetic waves has a property known as the state of polarization. Polarization effects are generally not very important to the heat transfer engineer since emitted light generally is randomly polarized. In some applications partially or fully polarized light is employed, for example, from laser sources; and the engineer

needs to know  $(i)$  how the reflective behavior of a surface depends on the polarization of incoming light, and  $(ii)$  how reflection from a surface tends to alter the state of polarization. We shall give here only a very brief introduction to polarization, based heavily on the excellent short description in Bohren and Huffman [2]. More detailed accounts on the subject may be found in the books by van de Hulst [4], Chandrasekhar [5], and others.

Consider a plane monochromatic wave with wavenumber  $\eta$  propagating through a nonabsorbing medium  $(k\equiv 0)$  in the  $\mathcal{Z}$  - direction. When describing polarization, it is customary to relate parameters to the electric field (keeping in mind that the magnetic field is simply perpendicular to it), which follows from equation (2.36) as

$$
\mathbf{E} = \Re \{\mathbf{E}_c\} = \Re \{(\mathbf{A} - i\mathbf{B})e^{-2\pi i\eta n(z - ct)}\} = \mathbf{A}\cos 2\pi \eta n(z - ct) - \mathbf{B}\sin 2\pi \eta n(z - ct), \tag{2.44}
$$

where the vector  $\mathbf{E}_0$  and its real components  $\mathbf{A}$  and  $\mathbf{B}$  are independent of position and lie, at any position  $\mathcal{Z}$ , in the plane normal to the direction of propagation. At any given location, say  $z = 0$ , the tip of the electric field vector traces out the curve

$$
\mathbf{E}(z = 0,t) = \mathbf{A}\cos 2\pi \nu t + \mathbf{B}\sin 2\pi \nu t. \tag{2.45}
$$

This curve, shown in Fig. 2- 3, describes an ellipse that is known as the vibration ellipse. The ellipse collapses into a straight line if either  $\mathbf{A}$  or  $\mathbf{B}$  vanishes, in which case the wave is said to be linearly polarized (sometimes also called plane polarized). If  $\mathbf{A}$  and  $\mathbf{B}$  are perpendicular to one another and are of equal magnitude, the vibration ellipse becomes a circle and the wave is known as circularly polarized. In general, the wave in equation (2.44) is elliptically polarized.

At any given time, say  $t = 0$ , the curve described by the tip of the electric field vector is a helix (Fig. 2- 4), or

$$
\mathbf{E}(z,t = 0) = \mathbf{A}\cos 2\pi n\eta z - \mathbf{B}\sin 2\pi n\eta z. \tag{2.46}
$$

Equation (2.46) describes the electric field at any one particular time. As time increases the helix moves into the direction of propagation, and its intersection with any plane  $z =$  const describes the local vibration ellipse.

The state of polarization, which is characterized by its vibration ellipse, is defined by its ellipticity,  $b / a$  (the ratio of the length of its semiminor axis to that of its semimajor axis, as shown in Fig. 2- 3), its azimuth  $\gamma$  (the angle between an arbitrary reference direction and its semimajor axis), and its handedness (i.e., the direction with which the tip of the electric field vector traverses through the vibration ellipse, clockwise or counterclockwise). These three parameters together with the magnitude of the Poynting vector are the ellipsometric parameters of a plane wave.

Example 2.2. Calculate the ellipsometric parameters  $a,b,$  and  $\gamma$  for the wave considered in Example 2.1.

# Solution

From equation (2.44) we find

$$
\mathbf{A} = E_0(6\hat{\mathbf{1}} +2\hat{\mathbf{j}} -8\hat{\mathbf{k}}) / \sqrt{154},\quad \mathbf{B} = -E_0(3\hat{\mathbf{1}} -5\hat{\mathbf{j}} -4\hat{\mathbf{k}}) / \sqrt{154},
$$

FIGURE 2-4 Space variation of electric field at fixed times.

and at any given location, say  $z = 0$ , the electric field vector may be written as

$$
\mathbf{E} = E_0\left[(6\cos 2\pi \nu t - 3\sin 2\pi \nu t)\hat{\mathbf{i}} +(2\cos 2\pi \nu t + 5\sin 2\pi \nu t)\hat{\mathbf{j}} -(8\cos 2\pi \nu t - 4\sin 2\pi \nu t)\hat{\mathbf{k}}\right] / \sqrt{154}.
$$

The time- varying magnitude  $|\mathbf{E}|$  at this location then is

$$
\begin{array}{c}{|\mathbf{E}|^2 = \mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{E_0^2}{154} (36\cos^2 2\pi \nu t - 36\cos 2\pi \nu t\sin 2\pi \nu t + 9\sin^2 2\pi \nu t}\\ {+4\cos 2\pi \nu t + 20\cos^2 2\pi \nu t\sin 2\pi \nu t + 25\sin^2 2\pi \nu t}\\ {+64\cos 2\pi \nu t - 64\cos^2 2\pi \nu t\sin 2\pi \nu t + 16\sin^2 2\pi \nu t)}\\ {= E_0^2 (50 - 80\cos 2\pi \nu t\sin 2\pi \nu t + 54\cos^2 2\pi \nu t) / 154.} \end{array}
$$

The maximum  $(a)$  and minimum  $(b)$  of  $|\mathbf{E}|$  may be found by differentiating the last expression with respect to  $t$  and setting the result equal to zero. This operation leads to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{-80(\cos^2 2\pi \nu t - \sin^2 2\pi \nu t) = 108\sin 2\pi \nu t\cos 2\pi \nu t}\\ {-80\cos 4\pi \nu t = 54\sin 4\pi \nu t} \end{array}
$$

or

$$
2\pi \nu t = 0.5\tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{80}{54}\right).
$$

This function is double- valued, leading to  $(2\pi \nu t)_1 = - 27.99^\circ$  and  $(2\pi \nu t)_2 = 62.01^\circ$ . Substituting these values into the expression for  $\mathbf{E}$  gives

$$
\mathbf{E}_1 = E_0(0.5404\hat{\mathbf{u}} -0.0468\hat{\mathbf{j}} -0.7205\hat{\mathbf{k}}),\quad |\mathbf{E}| = a = 0.9009E_0
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{E}_2 = E_0(0.0134\hat{\mathbf{u}} +0.4314\hat{\mathbf{j}} -0.0179\hat{\mathbf{k}}),\quad |\mathbf{E}| = b = 0.4339E_0.
$$

The evaluation of the azimuth depends on the choice of a reference axis in the plane of the vibration ellipse. In the present problem the  $y$ - axis lies in this plane and is, therefore, the natural choice. Thus,

$$
\cos \gamma = \frac{\mathbf{E}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{j}}}{|\mathbf{E}|} = -\frac{0.0468}{0.9009} = -0.0519,\quad \gamma = 92.97^\circ .
$$

While the ellipsometric parameters completely describe any monochromatic wave, they are difficult to measure directly (with the exception of the Poynting vector). In addition, when

two or more waves of the same frequency but different polarization are superposed, only their strengths are additive: The other three ellipsometric parameters must be calculated anew. For these reasons a different but equivalent description of polarized light, known as Stokes' parameters, is usually preferred. The Stokes' parameters are defined by separating the wave train into two perpendicular components:

$$
\mathbf{E}_c = \mathbf{E}_0e^{-2\pi i\eta n(z - ct)};\quad \mathbf{E}_0 = E_{\parallel}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel} + E_{\perp}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}, \tag{2.47}
$$

where  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel}$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}$  are real orthogonal unit vectors in the plane normal to wave propagation, such that  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel}$  lies in an arbitrary reference plane that includes the wave propagation vector, and  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}$  is perpendicular to it.7 The parallel  $(E_{\parallel})$  and perpendicular  $(E_{\perp})$  polarization components are generally complex and may be written as

$$
E_{\parallel} = a_{\parallel}e^{-i\delta_{\parallel}},\quad E_{\perp} = a_{\perp}e^{-i\delta_{\perp}}, \tag{2.48}
$$

where  $a$  is the magnitude of the electric field and  $\delta$  is the phase angle of polarization. Waves with parallel polarization (i.e., with electric field in the plane of incidence, and magnetic field normal to it) are also called transverse magnetic (TM) waves; and perpendicular polarization is transverse electric (TE). Substitution into equation (2.44) leads to

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathbf{E} = \Re \{a_{\parallel}e^{-i\delta_{\parallel} - 2\pi i\eta n(z - ct)}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel} + a_{\perp}e^{-i\delta_{\perp} - 2\pi i\eta n(z - ct)}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}\}}\\ & {\quad = a_{\parallel}\cos [\delta_{\parallel} + 2\pi \eta n(z - ct)]\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel} + a_{\perp}\cos [\delta_{\perp} + 2\pi \eta n(z - ct)]\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}.} \end{array} \tag{2.49}
$$

Thus, the arbitrary wave given by equation (2.44) has been decomposed into two linearly polarized waves that are perpendicular to one another. The four Stokes' parameters  $I, Q, U,$  and  $V$  are defined by

$$
\begin{array}{c}{I = E_{\parallel}E_{\parallel}^{*} + E_{\perp}E_{\perp}^{*} = a_{\parallel}^{2} + a_{\perp}^{2},}\\ {Q = E_{\parallel}E_{\parallel}^{*} - E_{\perp}E_{\perp}^{*} = a_{\parallel}^{2} - a_{\perp}^{2},}\\ {U = E_{\parallel}E_{\perp}^{*} + E_{\perp}E_{\parallel}^{*} = 2a_{\parallel}a_{\perp}\cos (\delta_{\parallel} - \delta_{\perp}),}\\ {V = i(E_{\parallel}E_{\perp}^{*} - E_{\perp}E_{\parallel}^{*}) = 2a_{\parallel}a_{\perp}\sin (\delta_{\parallel} - \delta_{\perp}),} \end{array} \tag{2.50}
$$

where the asterisks again denote complex conjugates. It can be shown that these four parameters may be determined through power measurements either directly  $(I)$ , using a linear polarizer (arranged in the parallel and perpendicular directions for  $Q$ , rotated  $45^{\circ}$  for  $U$ ), or a circular polarizer  $(V)$  (see, for example, Bohren and Huffman [2]). It is clear that only three of the Stokes' parameters are independent, since

$$
I^2 = Q^2 +U^2 +V^2. \tag{2.54}
$$

Since the Stokes' parameters of a wave train are expressed in terms of the energy contents of its component waves [which can be seen by comparison with equation (2.42)], it follows that the Stokes' parameters for a collection of waves are additive.

The Stokes' parameters may also be related to the ellipsometric parameters by

$$
\begin{array}{c}{I = a^2 +b^2,}\\ {Q = (a^2 -b^2)\cos 2\gamma ,}\\ {U = (a^2 -b^2)\sin 2\gamma ,}\\ {V = \pm 2ab,} \end{array} \tag{2.58}
$$

where the azimuth  $\gamma$  is measured from  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel}$ , and the sign of  $V$  specifies the handedness of the vibration ellipse. The sets of Stokes' parameters for a few special cases of polarization are shown—normalized, and written as column vectors—in Table 2.1 (from [2]). The parameters  $Q$  and  $U$  show the degree of linear polarization (plus its orientation), while  $V$  is related to the degree of circular polarization.

The above definition of the Stokes' parameters is correct for strictly monochromatic waves as given by equation (2.47). Most natural light sources, such as the sun, lightbulbs, fires, and so on, produce light whose amplitude,  $\mathbf{E}_0$ , is a slowly varying function of time (i.e., in comparison with a full wave period,  $1 / \nu$ ), or

$$
\mathbf{E}_0(t) = E_{\parallel}(t)\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel} + E_{\perp}(t)\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}. \tag{2.59}
$$

Such waves are called quasi- monochromatic. If, through their slow respective variations with time,  $E_{\parallel}$  and  $E_{\perp}$  are uncorrelated, then the wave is said to be unpolarized. In such a case the vibration ellipse changes slowly with time, eventually tracing out ellipses of all shapes, orientations, and handedness. All waves discussed so far had a fixed relationship between  $E_{\parallel}$  and  $E_{\perp}$ , and are known as (completely) polarized. If some correlation between  $E_{\parallel}$  and  $E_{\perp}$  exists (for example, a wave of constant handedness, ellipticity, or azimuth), then the wave is called partially polarized. For quasi- monochromatic waves the Stokes' parameters are defined in terms of time- averaged values, and equation (2.54) must be replaced by

$$
I^2\geq Q^2 +U^2 +V^2, \tag{2.60}
$$

where the equality sign holds only for polarized light. For unpolarized light one gets  $Q = U = V = 0$ , while for partially polarized light the magnitudes of  $Q$ ,  $U$ , and  $V$  give the following:

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & \text{degree of polarization} = \sqrt{Q^2 + U^2 + V^2} /I, \\ & \text{degree of linear polarization} = \sqrt{Q^2 + U^2} /I, \\ & \text{degree of circular polarization} = V / I. \end{array}
$$

Example 2.3. Reconsider the plane wave of the last two examples. Decompose the wave into two linearly polarized waves, one in the  $x$ - z- plane, and the other perpendicular to it. What are the Stokes' coefficients, the phase differences between the two polarizations, and the different degrees of polarization?

# Solution

With  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} = 0.8\hat{\mathbf{1}} +0.6\hat{\mathbf{k}}$  and the knowledge that  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel}$  must lie in the  $x - z$  - plane, i.e.,  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{j}} = 0,$  and that  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel}$  must be normal to  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  or  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} = 0,$  and finally that  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}$  must be perpendicular to both of them, we get

$$
\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel} = 0.6\hat{\mathbf{1}} -0.8\hat{\mathbf{k}},\quad \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp} = \hat{\mathbf{j}},
$$

where the choice of sign for both vectors is arbitrary (and we have chosen to let  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel},\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp},$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  form a right- handed coordinate system). Thus, from equation (2.47) and

$$
\mathbf{E}_0 = E_0[(6 + 3i)\hat{\mathbf{1}} +(2 - 5i)\hat{\mathbf{j}} -(8 + 4i)\hat{\mathbf{k}} ] / \sqrt{154}
$$

it follows immediately that

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathbf{E}_0 = E_0(2 + i)(3\hat{\mathbf{1}} -4\hat{\mathbf{k}}) / \sqrt{154} = \left(5 / \sqrt{154}\right)(2 + i)E_0\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel},}\\ & {\mathbf{E}_{\perp} = E_0(2 - 5i)\hat{\mathbf{j}} /\sqrt{154} = \left[(2 - 5i) / \sqrt{154}\right]E_0\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp},} \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{l}{E_{\parallel} = \left(5 / \sqrt{154}\right)(2 + i)E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{125}{154}} E_0e^{-i\delta_{\parallel}},}\\ {E_{\perp} = \left[(2 - 5i) / \sqrt{154}\right]E_0 = \sqrt{\frac{29}{154}} E_0e^{-i\delta_{\perp}},} \end{array}
$$

with

$$
\begin{array}{l}\delta_{\parallel} = -\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -26.565^{\circ},\\ \delta_{\perp} = -\tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{5}{2}\right) = 68.199^{\circ}, \end{array}
$$

and a phase difference between the two polarizations of

$$
\delta_{\parallel} - \delta_{\perp} = -94.76^{\circ}
$$

(since  $\tan^{- 1}$  is a double- valued function, the correct value is determined by checking the signs of the real and imaginary parts of  $E$  ). The Stokes' parameters can be calculated either directly from equations (2.50) through (2.53), or from equations (2.55) through (2.58) (using the ellipsometric parameters calculated in the last example). We use here the first approach so that we get

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & I = (125 + 29)E_0^2 /154 = E_0^2,\\ & Q = (125 - 29)E_0^2 /154 = 48E_0^2 /77,\\ & U = 5(4 + 2i + 10i - 5 + 4 - 2i - 10i - 5)E_0^2 /154 = -5E_0^2 /77,\\ & V = 5i(4 + 2i + 10i - 5 - 4 + 2i + 10i + 5)E_0^2 /154 = -60E_0^2 /77. \end{array}
$$

Finally, the degrees of polarization follow as  $\sqrt{Q^2 + U^2 + V^2} /I = 100\%$  total polarization,  $\sqrt{Q^2 + U^2} /I =$ $62.7\%$  linear polarization, and  $|V| / I = 77.9\%$  circular polarization.

In general, the state of polarization of an electromagnetic wave train is changed when it interacts with an optical element (which may be a polarizer or reflector, but can also be a reflecting surface in an enclosure, or a scattering element, such as suspended particles). While a polarized beam is characterized by its four- element Stokes vector, it is possible to represent the effects of an optical element by a  $4\times 4$  matrix, known as the Mueller matrix, which describes the relations between incident and transmitted Stokes vectors. Details can be found, e.g., in Bohren and Huffman [2].

# 2.5 REFLECTION AND TRANSMISSION

When an electromagnetic wave is incident on the interface between two homogeneous media, the wave will be partially reflected and partially transmitted into the second medium. We will

FIGURE 2-5 Geometry for derivation of interface conditions.

FIGURE 2- 5 Geometry for derivation of interface conditions.

limit our discussion here to plane interfaces, i.e., to cases where the local radius of curvature is much greater than the wavelength of the incoming light,  $\lambda$ , for which the problem may be reduced to algebraic equations. Some discussion on strongly curved surfaces in the form of small particles will be given in Chapter 12, which deals with radiative properties of particulate clouds.

In the following, after first establishing the general conditions for Maxwell's equations at the interface, we shall consider a wave traveling from one nonabsorbing medium into another nonabsorbing medium, followed by a short discussion of a wave incident from a nonabsorbing onto an absorbing medium.

# Interface Conditions for Maxwell's Equations

To establish boundary conditions for  $\mathbf{E}$  and  $\mathbf{H}$  at an interface between two media, we shall apply the theorems of Gauss and Stokes to Maxwell's equations. Both theorems convert volume integrals to surface integrals and are discussed in detail in standard mathematical texts such as Wylie [3]. Given a vector function  $\mathbf{F}$ , defined within a volume  $V$  and on its boundary  $\Gamma$ , the theorems may be stated as

Gauss' theorem:

$$
\int_{V}\nabla \cdot \mathbf{F}dV = \int_{\Gamma}\mathbf{F}\cdot d\Gamma , \tag{2.61}
$$

Stokes' theorem:

$$
\int_{V}\nabla \times \mathbf{F}dV = -\int_{\Gamma}\mathbf{F}\times d\Gamma , \tag{2.62}
$$

where  $d\Gamma = \hat{\mathbf{n}} d\Gamma$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$  is a unit surface normal pointing out of the volume.

Now consider a thin volume element  $\delta V = A\delta s$  containing part of the interface as shown in Fig. 2- 5. Applying Gauss' theorem to the first of Maxwell's equations, equation (2.11) yields

$$
\int_{\delta V}\nabla \cdot (\gamma \mathbf{E}_c)dV = \int_{\Gamma}\gamma \mathbf{E}_c\cdot d\Gamma \approx \int_A[(\gamma \mathbf{E}_c)_1\cdot (\hat{\mathbf{\Gamma}}\hat{\mathbf{n}}) + (\gamma \mathbf{E}_c)_2\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} ]dA = 0, \tag{2.63}
$$

where  $\Gamma$  is the total surface area of  $\delta V$ , and contributions to the surface integral come mainly from the two sides parallel to the interface since  $\delta s$  is small. Also, shrinking  $A$  to an arbitrarily small area, we conclude that, everywhere along the interface,

$$
m_1^2\mathbf{E}_{c1}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = m_2^2\mathbf{E}_{c2}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}, \tag{2.64}
$$

where equation (2.31) has been used, together with assuming nonmagnetic media, to eliminate the complex permittivity  $\gamma$ . Similarly, from equation (2.12)

$$
\mathbf{H}_{c1}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \mathbf{H}_{c2}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}. \tag{2.65}
$$

Thus, the normal components of  $m^2\mathbf{E}_c$  and  $\mathbf{H}_c$  are conserved across a plane boundary. Stokes' theorem may be applied to equations (2.13) and (2.14), again for the volume element shown in Fig. 2- 5. For example,

$$
\int_{\delta V}\nabla \times \mathbf{H}_c dV = -\int_{\Gamma}\mathbf{H}_c\times d\Gamma \approx \int_A(\mathbf{H}_{c1} - \mathbf{H}_{c2})\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} dA = \int_V2\pi i\nu \gamma \mathbf{E}_c dV, \tag{2.66}
$$

FIGURE 2-6 Transmission and reflection of a plane wave at the interface between two nonabsorbing media.

or, after shrinking  $\delta s \to 0$  and  $A$  to a small value,

$$
\mathbf{E}_{c1}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \mathbf{E}_{c2}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} \tag{2.67}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{H}_{c1}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \mathbf{H}_{c2}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}}. \tag{2.68}
$$

Therefore, the tangential components of both  $\mathbf{E}_c$  and  $\mathbf{H}_c$  are conserved across a plane boundary.

Given the incident wave, it is possible to find the complete fields from Maxwell's equations and the above interface conditions. However, it is obvious that there will be a reflected wave in the medium of incidence, and a transmitted wave in the other medium. We may also assume that all waves remain plane waves. A consequence of having guessed the solution to this point is that conditions (2.67) and (2.68) are sufficient to specify the reflected and transmitted waves, and it turns out that conditions (2.64) and (2.65) are automatically satisfied (Stone [1]).

# The Interface between Two Nonabsorbing Media

The reflection and transmission relationships become particularly simple if homogeneous plane waves reach the plane interface between two nonabsorbing media. For such a wave train the planes of equal phase and equal amplitude coincide and are normal to the direction of propagation, as shown in Fig. 2- 6. This plane, also called the wavefront, moves at constant speed  $c_{1} = c_{0} / n_{1}$  through Medium 1, and at a constant but speed  $c_{2} = c_{0} / n_{2}$  through Medium 2. If  $n_{2} > n_{1}$  then, as shown in Fig. 2- 6, the wavefront will move more slowly through Medium 2, lagging behind the wavefront traveling through Medium 1. This is readily put in mathematical terms by looking at points  $A$  and  $B$  on the wavefront at a certain time  $t$ . At time  $t + \Delta t$  the part of the wavefront initially at  $A$  will have reached point  $A'$  on the interface while the wavefront at point  $B$ , traveling a shorter distance through Medium 2, will have reached point  $B'$ , where

$$
\Delta t = \frac{\overline{A A^{\prime}}}{c_{1}} = \frac{\overline{B B^{\prime}}}{c_{2}}. \tag{2.69}
$$

Using geometric relations for  $\overline{AA'}$  and  $\overline{BB'}$  and substituting for the phase velocities, we obtain

$$
\Delta t = \frac{\overline{BA^{\prime}}\sin\theta_{i}}{c_{0} / n_{1}} = \frac{\overline{BA^{\prime}}\sin\theta_{2}}{c_{0} / n_{2}} = \frac{\overline{BA^{\prime}}\sin\theta_{r}}{c_{0} / n_{1}}, \tag{2.70}
$$

where the last term pertains to reflection, for which a similar relationship must exist (but which is not shown to avoid overcrowding of the figure). Thus we conclude that

$$
\theta_{r} = \theta_{i} = \theta_{1}, \tag{2.71}
$$

that is, according to electromagnetic wave theory, reflection of light is always purely specular. This is a direct consequence of a "plane" interface, i.e., a surface that is not only flat (with infinite radius of curvature) but also perfectly smooth. Equation (2.70) also gives a relationship between the directions of the incoming and transmitted waves as

$$
\frac{\sin\theta_2}{\sin\theta_1} = \frac{n_1}{n_2}, \tag{2.72}
$$

which is known as Snell's law.* The angles  $\theta_{1} = \theta_{i}$  and  $\theta_{2} = \theta_{r}$  are called the angles of incidence and refraction. The present derivation of Snell's law was based on geometric principles and is valid only for plane homogeneous waves, which limits its applicability to the interface between two nonabsorbing media, i.e., two perfect dielectrics. A more rigorous derivation of a generalized version of Snell's law is given when incidence on an absorbing medium is considered.

Besides the directions of reflection and transmission we should like to be able to determine the amounts of reflected and transmitted light. From equations (2.19) and (2.20) we can write expressions for the electric and magnetic fields in Medium 1 (consisting of incident and reflected waves) by setting  $\mathbf{w}'' = 0$  for a nonabsorbing medium as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{E}_{c1} = \mathbf{E}_{0i}e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}_{\mathbf{i}}^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)} + \mathbf{E}_{0r}e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}_{\mathbf{i}}^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)},\\ \mathbf{H}_{c1} = \mathbf{H}_{0i}e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}_{\mathbf{i}}^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)} + \mathbf{H}_{0r}e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}_{\mathbf{i}}^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)}. \end{array} \tag{2.74}
$$

Similarly for Medium 2,

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{E}_{c2} = \mathbf{E}_{0t}e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}_{\mathbf{i}}^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)},\\ \mathbf{H}_{c2} = \mathbf{H}_{0t}e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}_{\mathbf{i}}^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)}. \end{array} \tag{2.76}
$$

For convenience we place the coordinate origin at that point of the boundary where reflection and transmission are to be considered. Thus, at that point of the interface, with  $\mathbf{r} = 0$ , using boundary conditions (2.67) and (2.68),

$$
\begin{array}{r}(\mathbf{E}_{0i} + \mathbf{E}_{0r})\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \mathbf{E}_{0t}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}},\\ (\mathbf{H}_{0i} + \mathbf{H}_{0r})\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \mathbf{H}_{0t}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}}. \end{array} \tag{2.78}
$$

To evaluate the tangential components of the electric and magnetic fields at the interface, it is advantageous to break up the fields (which, in general, may be unpolarized or elliptically polarized) into two linearly polarized waves, one parallel to the plane of incidence (formed by the incident wave vector  $\mathbf{w}_i$  and the surface normal  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ ), and the other perpendicular to it, or

$$
\mathbf{E}_0 = E_{||}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{||} + E_{\perp}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp},\quad \mathbf{H}_0 = H_{||}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{||} + H_{\perp}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}. \tag{2.79}
$$

This is shown schematically in Fig. 2- 7. It is readily apparent from the figure that, in the plane of incidence, the unit vectors normal to the interface ( $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ ) and tangential to the interface ( $\hat{\mathbf{t}}$ ) may be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\hat{\mathbf{n}} = \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i\cos \theta_1 - \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{i\parallel}\sin \theta_1 = -\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r\cos \theta_1 + \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{r\parallel}\sin \theta_1 = \hat{\mathbf{s}}_t\cos \theta_2 - \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{t\parallel}\sin \theta_2,\\ \hat{\mathbf{t}} = \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i\sin \theta_1 + \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{i\parallel}\cos \theta_1 = \hat{\mathbf{s}}_r\sin \theta_1 + \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{r\parallel}\cos \theta_1 = \hat{\mathbf{s}}_t\sin \theta_2 + \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{t\parallel}\cos \theta_2. \end{array} \tag{2.80b}
$$

![](images/2b22f9a174e4b0c04b95ed8c8ee377c744706e93d2779a7ff93b8e88bbd04ed4.jpg)  
FIGURE 2-7 Orientation of wave vectors at an interface.

As defined in Fig. 2- 7 the unit vectors  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel}, \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  form right- handed coordinate systems for the incident and transmitted waves, i.e.,

$$
\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel} = \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}\times \hat{\mathbf{s}},\quad \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp} = \hat{\mathbf{s}}\times \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel},\quad \hat{\mathbf{s}} = \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel}\times \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}, \tag{2.81}
$$

and a left- handed coordinate system for the reflected wave (leading to opposite signs for the above cross- products of unit vectors).<sup>8</sup>

Therefore, from equation (2.80)

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \pm \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel}\times \hat{\mathbf{s}}\cos \theta = -\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}\cos \theta ,}\\ & {\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \pm \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}\times \hat{\mathbf{s}}\cos \theta \mp \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp}\times \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel}\sin \theta = \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel}\cos \theta +\hat{\mathbf{s}}\sin \theta = \hat{\mathbf{t}},} \end{array}
$$

where the top sign applies to the incident and transmitted waves, while the lower sign applies to the reflected component. The second of these relations can also be obtained directly from Fig. 2- 7. Using these relations, equations (2.77) and (2.78) may be rewritten in terms of polarized components as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{(E_{r\parallel} + E_{r\parallel})\cos \theta_1 = E_{t\parallel}\cos \theta_2,}\\ {E_{i\perp} + E_{r\perp} = E_{t\perp},}\\ {(H_{i\parallel} + H_{r\parallel})\cos \theta_1 = H_{t\parallel}\cos \theta_2,}\\ {H_{i\perp} + H_{r\perp} = H_{t\perp}.} \end{array} \tag{2.85}
$$

The magnetic field may be eliminated through the use of equation (2.25): With  $\mathbf{w} = \eta_0 m \hat{\mathbf{s}} = (\nu / c_0) m \hat{\mathbf{s}}$  from equation (2.31) we have

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{\bf H}_0 = \frac{m}{c_0\mu}\hat{\bf s}\times {\bf E}_0 = \pm \frac{m}{c_0\mu\cos\theta} (\hat{\bf n}\pm \hat{\bf e}_{\parallel}\sin \theta)\times (E_{\parallel}\hat{\bf e}_{\parallel} + E_{\perp}\hat{\bf e}_{\perp})}\\ {= \pm \frac{m}{c_0\mu\cos\theta}\left[E_{\parallel}\cos \theta \hat{\bf e}_{\perp} - E_{\perp}(\hat{\bf t} -\hat{\bf s}\sin \theta)\right]}\\ {= \pm \frac{m}{c_0\mu} (E_{\parallel}\hat{\bf e}_{\perp} - E_{\perp}\hat{\bf e}_{\parallel}).} \end{array} \tag{2.86}
$$

Again, the upper sign applies to incident and transmitted waves, and the lower sign to reflected waves. The last two conditions may now be rewritten in terms of the electric field. Assuming the magnetic permeability to be the same in both media, and setting  $m = n$  (nonabsorbing media), this leads to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{(E_{i\perp} - E_{r\perp})n_1\cos \theta_1 = E_{i\perp}n_2\cos \theta_2,}\\ {(E_{i\parallel} - E_{r\parallel})n_1 = E_{t\parallel}n_2.} \end{array} \tag{2.88}
$$

From this one may calculate the reflection coefficient  $r$  and the transmission coefficient  $t$  as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{r_{\parallel} = \frac{E_{r\parallel}}{E_{i\parallel}} = \frac{n_1\cos\theta_2 - n_2\cos\theta_1}{n_1\cos\theta_2 + n_2\cos\theta_1},}\\ {r_{\perp} = \frac{E_{r\perp}}{E_{i\perp}} = \frac{n_1\cos\theta_1 - n_2\cos\theta_2}{n_1\cos\theta_1 + n_2\cos\theta_2},}\\ {t_{\parallel} = \frac{E_{t\parallel}}{E_{i\parallel}} = \frac{2n_1\cos\theta_1}{n_1\cos\theta_2 + n_2\cos\theta_1},}\\ {t_{\perp} = \frac{E_{t\perp}}{E_{i\perp}} = \frac{2n_1\cos\theta_1}{n_1\cos\theta_1 + n_2\cos\theta_2}.} \end{array} \tag{2.90}
$$

For an interface between two nonabsorbing media these coefficients turn out to be real, even though the electric field amplitudes are complex. The reflectivity  $\rho$  is defined as the fraction of energy in a wave that is reflected and must, therefore, be calculated from the Poynting vector, equation (2.42), so that

$$
\rho_{\parallel} = \frac{\overline{S}_{r\parallel}}{\overline{S}_{i\parallel}} = \left(\frac{E_{r\parallel}}{E_{i\parallel}}\right)^2 = r_{\parallel}^2 \tag{2.93}
$$

gives the reflectivity of that part of the wave whose electric field vector lies in the plane of incidence (with its magnetic field normal to it), and

$$
\rho_{\perp} = \frac{\overline{S}_{r\perp}}{\overline{S}_{i\perp}} = \left(\frac{E_{r\perp}}{E_{i\perp}}\right)^2 = r_{\perp}^2 \tag{2.94}
$$

is the reflectivity for the part whose electric field vector is normal to the plane of incidence. In terms of these polarized components the overall reflectivity may be stated as "reflected energy for both polarizations, divided by the total incoming energy," or

$$
\rho = \frac{E_{i\parallel}E_{i\parallel}^{*}\rho_{\parallel} + E_{i\perp}E_{i\perp}^{*}\rho_{\perp}}{E_{i\parallel}E_{i\parallel}^{*} + E_{i\perp}E_{i\perp}^{*}}. \tag{2.95}
$$

For unpolarized and circularly polarized light  $E_{i\parallel} = E_{i\perp}$ , and the reflectivity for the entire wave train is

$$
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left(\rho_{\parallel} + \rho_{\perp}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{n_1\cos\theta_2 - n_2\cos\theta_1}{n_1\cos\theta_2 + n_2\cos\theta_1}\right)^2 +\left(\frac{n_1\cos\theta_1 - n_2\cos\theta_2}{n_1\cos\theta_1 + n_2\cos\theta_2}\right)^2\right]. \tag{2.96}
$$

From this relationship the refractive indices may be eliminated through Snell's law, giving

$$
\rho = \frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{\tan^2(\theta_1 - \theta_2)}{\tan^2(\theta_1 + \theta_2)} +\frac{\sin^2(\theta_1 - \theta_2)}{\sin^2(\theta_1 + \theta_2)}\right], \tag{2.97}
$$

which is known as Fresnel's relation.* Subroutine fresnel in Appendix F is a generalized version of Fresnel's relation for an interface between a perfect dielectric and an absorbing medium (see following section), where  $\mathbf{r} = n_2 / n_1$ ,  $\mathbf{k} = k_2 / n_1$ , and  $\mathbf{th} = \theta_1$ .

![](images/3a3f29f39b4e3b19b7a021f534f8f7aad708cab21460c3d37acb0c17b6d1ca83.jpg)  
FIGURE 2-8 Reflection coefficients and reflectivities for the interface between two dielectrics  $(n_{2} / n_{1} = 1.5)$ .

The overall transmissivity  $\tau$  may similarly be evaluated from the Poynting vector, equation (2.42), but the different refractive indices and wave propagation directions in the transmitting and incident media must be considered, so that

$$
\tau = \frac{n_2}{n_1}\frac{\cos\theta_2}{\cos\theta_1} t^2 = 1 - \rho . \tag{2.98}
$$

An example for the angular reflectivity at the interface between two dielectrics (with  $n_2 / n_1 = 1.5$ ) is given in Fig. 2- 8. It is seen that, at an angle of incidence of  $\theta_{1} = \theta_{p}, r_{\parallel}$  passes through zero resulting in a zero reflectivity for the parallel component of the wave. This angle is known as the polarizing angle or Brewster's angle,* since light reflected from the surface—regardless of the incident polarization—will be completely polarized. Brewster's angle follows from equations (2.72) and (2.89) as

$$
\tan \theta_{p} = \frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}. \tag{2.99}
$$

Different behavior is observed if light travels from one dielectric into another, optically less dense medium  $(n_{1} > n_{2})$ , shown in Fig. 2- 9. Examination of equation (2.72) shows that  $\theta_{2}$  reaches the value of  $90^{\circ}$  for an angle of incidence  $\theta_{c}$ , called the critical angle,

$$
\sin \theta_{c} = \frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}. \tag{2.100}
$$

It is left as an exercise for the reader to show that, for  $\theta_{1} > \theta_{c}$ , light of any polarization is reflected, and nothing is transmitted into the second medium.

It is important to realize that upon reflection a wave changes its state of polarization, since  $E_{\parallel}$  and  $E_{\perp}$  are attenuated by different amounts. If the incident wave is unpolarized (e.g., emission from a hot surface),  $E_{\parallel}$  and  $E_{\perp}$  are unrelated and will remain so after reflection. If the incident wave is polarized (e.g., laser radiation), the relationship between  $E_{\parallel}$  and  $E_{\perp}$  will change, causing a change in polarization.

Example 2.4. The plane homogeneous wave of the previous examples encounters the flat interface with another dielectric  $(n_{2} = 8 / 3)$  that is described by the equation  $z = 0$  (i.e., the  $x - y$ - plane at  $z = 0$ ). Calculate

the angles of incidence, reflection, and refraction. What fraction of energy of the wave is reflected, and how much is transmitted? In addition, determine the state of polarization of the reflected wave.

# Solution

Since the interface is described by  $z = 0$ , the surface normal (pointing into Medium 2) is simply  $\hat{\mathbf{n}} = \hat{\mathbf{k}}$ . From  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} = 0.8\hat{\mathbf{1}} +0.6\hat{\mathbf{k}}$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} = \cos \theta_{1} = 0.6$ , it follows that the angle of incidence is  $\theta_{1} = 53.13^{\circ}$  off normal, which is equal to the angle of reflection, while the angle of refraction follows from Snell's law, equation (2.72), as

$$
\sin \theta_{2} = \frac{n_{1}}{n_{2}}\sin \theta_{1} = \frac{2}{8 / 3}\times 0.8 = 0.6,\quad \theta_{2} = 36.82^{\circ}.
$$

It follows that  $\cos \theta_{2} = 0.8$  and the reflection coefficients are calculated from equations (2.89) and (2.90) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{r_{\parallel} = \frac{2\times 0.8 - (8 / 3)\times 0.6}{2\times 0.8 + (8 / 3)\times 0.6} = \frac{1.6 - 1.6}{3.2} = 0,}\\ {r_{\perp} = \frac{2\times 0.6 - (8 / 3)\times 0.8}{2\times 0.6 + (8 / 3)\times 0.8} = \frac{3.6 - 6.4}{10.0} = -0.28,} \end{array}
$$

and the respective reflectivities follow as

$$
\rho_{\parallel} = 0\mathrm{and}\rho_{\perp} = (-0.28)^{2} = 0.0784.
$$

For the present wave and interface, the wave impinges on the surface at Brewster's angle, i.e., the component of the wave that is linearly polarized in the plane of incidence is totally transmitted.

In general, to calculate the overall reflectivity, the wave must be decomposed into two linear polarized components, vibrating within the plane of incidence and perpendicular to it. Fortunately, this was already done in Example 2.3. From equation (2.95), together with the values of  $E_{\parallel} = [5(2 + i) / \sqrt{154}]E_{0}$  and  $E_{i\perp} = [(2 - 5i) / \sqrt{154}]E_{0}$  from the previous example, we obtain

$$
\rho = \frac{E_{i\parallel}E_{i\parallel}^{*}\rho_{\parallel} + E_{i\perp}E_{i\perp}^{*}\rho_{\perp}}{E_{i\parallel}E_{i\parallel}^{*} + E_{i\perp}E_{i\perp}^{*}} = \frac{125\times 0 + 29\times 0.0784}{154} = 0.0148,
$$

and the overall transmissivity  $\tau$  follows as

$$
\tau = 1 - \rho = 0.9852.
$$

To determine the polarization of the reflected beam, we first need to determine the reflected electric field amplitude vector. From the definition of the reflection coefficient we have

$$
E_{r\parallel} = r_{\parallel}E_{i\parallel} = 0,\quad E_{r\perp} = r_{\perp}E_{i\perp} = -0.28\times \frac{2 - 5i}{\sqrt{154}} E_{0}
$$

and, from equations (2.50) through (2.53),

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I = -Q = E_{r\perp}E_{r\perp}^{*} = \frac{0.28^{2}}{154} 29E_{0}^{2} = 0.01476E_{0}^{2},}\\ {U = V = 0.} \end{array}
$$

Therefore, the wave remains  $100\%$  polarized, but the polarization is not completely linear. Indeed, any polarized radiation reflecting off a surface at Brewster's angle will become linearly polarized with only a perpendicular component.

# The Interface between a Perfect Dielectric and an Absorbing Medium

The analysis of reflection and transmission at the interface between two perfect dielectrics is relatively straightforward, since an incident plane homogeneous wave remains plane and homogeneous after reflection and transmission. However, if a plane homogeneous wave is incident upon an absorbing medium, then the transmitted wave is, in general, inhomogeneous. If a beam travels from one absorbing medium into another absorbing medium, then the wave is usually inhomogeneous in both, making the analysis somewhat cumbersome. Fortunately, the interface between two absorbers is rarely important: A wave traveling through an absorbing medium is usually strongly attenuated, if not totally absorbed, before hitting a second absorber. In this section we shall consider a plane homogeneous light wave incident from a perfect dielectric on an absorbing medium.

The incident, reflected, and transmitted waves are again described by equations (2.73) through (2.76), except that the wave vector for transmission,  $\mathbf{w}_t$ , may be complex. Thus using equations (2.67) and (2.68), the interface condition may be written as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{E}_{0i}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} e^{-2\pi i\mathbf{w}_{i}^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r}} + \mathbf{E}_{0r}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} e^{-2\pi i\mathbf{w}_{i}^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{E}_{0t}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}_{i}^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r} - i\mathbf{w}_{i}^{\prime \prime}\cdot \mathbf{r})},\\ \mathbf{H}_{0i}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} e^{-2\pi i\mathbf{w}_{i}^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r}} + \mathbf{H}_{0r}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} e^{-2\pi i\mathbf{w}_{i}^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{H}_{0t}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}} e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}_{i}^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r} - i\mathbf{w}_{i}^{\prime \prime}\cdot \mathbf{r})}, \end{array} \tag{2.101}
$$

where  $\mathbf{r}$  is left arbitrary here in order to derive formally the generalized form of Snell's law although, for convenience, we still assume that the coordinate origin lies on the interface. We note that none of the amplitude vectors,  $\mathbf{E}_{0i}, \mathbf{H}_{0i},$  etc., depends on location, and that  $\mathbf{r}$  is a vector to an arbitrary point on the interface, which may be varied independently. Thus, in order for equations (2.101) and (2.102) to hold at any point on the interface, we must have

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{w}_i^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{w}_r^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{w}_t^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{r},\\ 0 = \mathbf{w}_t^{\prime \prime}\cdot \mathbf{r}, \end{array} \tag{2.103}
$$

that is, since  $\mathbf{r}$  is tangential to the interface, the tangential components of the wave vector  $\mathbf{w}^{\prime}$  must be continuous across the interface, while the tangential component of the attenuation vector  $\mathbf{w}_t^{\prime \prime}$  must be zero, or  $\mathbf{w}_t^{\prime \prime} = u_t^{\prime \prime} / \hat{\mathbf{n}}$ . Thus, within the absorbing medium, planes of equal amplitude are parallel to the interface, as indicated in Fig. 2- 10. Since  $\mathbf{w}_t^{\prime}$  has the same tangential component as  $\mathbf{w}_i^{\prime}$  as well as the same magnitude [cf. equation (2.31)], it follows again that the reflection must be specular, or  $\theta_r = \theta_i$ .

The continuity of the tangential component for the transmitted wave vector indicates that

$$
w_{i}^{\prime}\sin \theta_{1} = \eta_{0}n_{1}\sin \theta_{1} = w_{i}^{\prime}\sin \theta_{2}. \tag{2.105}
$$

The wave vector for transmission,  $w_{t}^{\prime}$ , may be eliminated from equation (2.105) by using equation (2.31):

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{w}_t\cdot \mathbf{w}_t = w_t^{\prime 2} - w_t^{\prime \prime 2} - 2i\mathbf{w}_t^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{w}_t^{\prime \prime} = \eta_0^2 m_2^2 = \eta_0^2 (n_2^2 -k_2^2 -2n_2k_2), \end{array} \tag{2.106a}
$$

or

FIGURE 2-10 Transmission and reflection at the interface between a dielectric and an absorbing medium.

$$
\begin{array}{c}{w_t^{\prime 2} - w_t^{\prime \prime 2} = \eta_0^2 (n_2^2 -k_2^2),}\\ {\mathbf{w}_t^{\prime}\cdot \mathbf{w}_t^{\prime \prime} = w_t^{\prime}w_t^{\prime \prime}\cos \theta_2 = \eta_0^2 n_2k_2.} \end{array} \tag{2.106b}
$$

Thus, equations (2.105) and (2.106) constitute three equations in the three unknowns  $\theta_{2},w_{t}^{\prime}$ , and  $w_{t}^{\prime \prime}$ . This system of equations may be solved to yield

$$
\begin{array}{l}{r^{2} = \left(\frac{w_{t}^{\prime}\cos\theta_{2}}{\eta_{0}}\right)^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\left[\sqrt{(n_{2}^{2} - k_{2}^{2} - n_{1}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1})^{2} + 4n_{2}^{2}k_{2}^{2}} +\left(n_{2}^{2} - k_{2}^{2} - n_{1}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1}\right)\right],}\\ {q^{2} = \left(\frac{w_{t}^{\prime\prime}}{\eta_{0}}\right)^{2} = \frac{1}{2}\left[\sqrt{(n_{2}^{2} - k_{2}^{2} - n_{1}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1})^{2} + 4n_{2}^{2}k_{2}^{2}} -\left(n_{2}^{2} - k_{2}^{2} - n_{1}^{2}\sin^{2}\theta_{1}\right)\right],} \end{array} \tag{2.107b}
$$

and the refraction angle  $\theta_{2}$  may be calculated from equation (2.105) as

$$
p\tan \theta_2 = n_1\sin \theta_1. \tag{2.108}
$$

Equation (2.108) together with equations (2.107) is known as the generalized Snell's law.

The reflection coefficients are calculated in the same fashion as was done for two dielectrics (left as an exercise). This leads to

$$
\begin{array}{r}\widetilde{r}_{||} = \frac{E_{r||}}{E_{i||}} = \frac{n_1^2(w_t'\cos\theta_2 - iw_t'') - m_2^2w_i'\cos\theta_1}{n_1^2(w_t'\cos\theta_2 - iw_t'') + m_2^2w_i'\cos\theta_1},\\ \widetilde{r}_{\perp} = \frac{E_{r\perp}}{E_{i\perp}} = \frac{w_i'\cos\theta_1 - (w_t'\cos\theta_2 - iw_t'')}{w_i'\cos\theta_1 + (w_t'\cos\theta_2 - iw_t'')}, \end{array} \tag{2.109b}
$$

where the tilde has been added to indicate that the reflection coefficients are now complex. From equations (2.106) through (2.107) we find

$$
m_2^2 = \frac{p^2}{\cos^2\theta_2} -q^2 -2ipq = p^2 (1 + \tan^2\theta_2) - q^2 -2ipq = p^2 -q^2 +n_1^2\sin^2\theta_1 - 2ipq. \tag{2.110}
$$

Eliminating the wave vectors, the reflection coefficients may be written as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\widetilde{r}_{||} = \frac{n_1(p - iq) - (p^2 - q^2 + n_1^2\sin^2\theta_1 - 2ipq)\cos\theta_1}{n_1(p - iq) + (p^2 - q^2 + n_1^2\sin^2\theta_1 - 2ipq)\cos\theta_1},\\ \widetilde{r}_{\perp} = \frac{n_1\cos\theta_1 - p + iq}{n_1\cos\theta_1 + p - iq}. \end{array} \tag{2.111b}
$$

The expression for  $\widetilde{r}_{\parallel}$  may be simplified by dividing the numerator (and denominator) of  $\widetilde{r}_{\parallel}$  by  $\cos \theta_1$  times the numerator (or denominator) of  $\widetilde{r}_{\perp}$ . This operation leads to

$$
\widetilde{r}_{\parallel} = \frac{p - n_1\sin\theta_1\tan\theta_1 - iq}{p + n_1\sin\theta_1\tan\theta_1 - iq}\widetilde{r}_{\perp}. \tag{2.112}

Finally, the reflectivities are again calculated as

$$
\begin{array}{c}\rho_{\parallel} = \widetilde{r_{\parallel}}\widetilde{r_{\parallel}} = \frac{(p - n_1\sin\theta_1\tan\theta_1)^2 + q^2}{(p + n_1\sin\theta_1\tan\theta_1)^2 + q^2}\rho_{\perp},\\ \rho_{\perp} = \widetilde{r_{\perp}}\widetilde{r_{\perp}} = \frac{(n_1\cos\theta_1 - p)^2 + q^2}{(n_1\cos\theta_1 + p)^2 + q^2}. \end{array} \tag{2.113b}
$$

Subroutine fresnel in Appendix F calculates  $\rho_{\parallel},\rho_{\perp},$  and  $\rho = (\rho_{\parallel} + \rho_{\perp}) / 2$  from this generalized version of Fresnel's relation for an interface between a perfect dielectric and an absorbing medium, where  $\mathbf{n} = n_2 / n_1,\mathbf{k} = k_2 / n_1,$  and  $\mathrm{th} = \theta_{1}$

We note that for normal incidence  $\theta_{1} = \theta_{2} = 0$ , resulting in  $p = n_2$ ,  $q = k_2$  and

$$
\rho_{\parallel} = \rho_{\perp} = \frac{(n_1 - n_2)^2 + k_2^2}{(n_1 + n_2)^2 + k_2^2}. \tag{2.114}

Calculate the incidence, reflection, and refraction angles. What fraction of energy of the wave is reflected, and how much is transmitted?

# Solution

If  $n_2$  and  $k_2$  are much larger than  $n_1$  it follows from equations (2.107) that  $p\approx n_2$  and  $q\approx k_2$  and, from equation (2.105),

$$
n_1\sin \theta_1\approx n_2\tan \theta_2\approx n_2\sin \theta_2
$$

(i.e., as long as  $n_2\gg n_1$ , Snell's law between dielectrics holds) and it follows that  $\theta_2 = 1.02^\circ$ . With  $n_2 = k_2$

equations (2.113) reduce to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\rho_{\perp} = \frac{(n_1\cos\theta_1 - n_2)^2 + n_2^2}{(n_1\cos\theta_1 + n_2)^2 + n_2^2} = \frac{(1.2 - 90)^2 + 90^2}{(1.2 + 90)^2 + 90^2} = 0.9737,}\\ {\rho_{\parallel} = \frac{(n_2 - n_1\sin\theta_1\tan\theta_1)^2 + n_2^2}{(n_2 + n_1\sin\theta_1\tan\theta_1)^2 + n_2^2}\rho_{\perp} = \frac{(90 - 2\times 0.8^2 / 0.6)^2 + 90^2}{(90 + 2\times 0.8^2 / 0.6)^2 + 90^2}\times 0.9737 = 0.9286,} \end{array}
$$

and the total reflectivity is again evaluated from equation (2.95) as

$$
\rho = \frac{E_{\parallel}E_{\parallel\parallel}\rho_{\parallel} + E_{i\perp}E_{i\perp}^{*}\rho_{\perp}}{E_{\parallel}E_{\parallel\parallel}^{*} + E_{i\perp}E_{i\perp}^{*}} = \frac{125\times 0.9286 + 29\times 0.9737}{154} = 0.9371.
$$

Thus, nearly  $94\%$  of the radiation is being reflected (and even more would have been reflected if the metal was surrounded by air with  $n \approx 1$ ), and only  $6\%$  is transmitted into the metal, where it undergoes total attenuation after a very short distance because of the large value of  $k_{2}$ : Equation (2.42) shows that the transmission reaches its  $1 / e$  value at

$$
4\pi \eta_0k_2z = 1,\quad \mathrm{or}\quad z = 1 / (4\pi \times 2500\times 90) = 3.5\times 10^{-7}\mathrm{cm} = 0.0035\mu \mathrm{m}.
$$

# Reflection and Transmission by a Thin Film or

# Slab

As a final topic we shall briefly consider the reflection and transmission by a thin film or slab of thickness  $d$  and complex index of refraction  $m_{2} = n_{2} - ik_{2}$ , embedded between two media with indices of refraction  $m_{1}$  and  $m_{3}$ , as illustrated in Fig. 2- 12. While the theory presented in this section is valid for slabs of arbitrary thickness, it is most appropriate for the study of interference wave effects in thin films or coatings. When an electromagnetic wave is reflected by a thin film, the waves reflected from both interfaces have different phases and interfere with one another (i.e., they may augment each other for small phase differences, or cancel each other for phase differences of  $180^{\circ}$ ). For thick slabs, such as window panes, geometric optics provides a much simpler vehicle to determine overall reflectivity and transmissivity. However, for an antireflective coating on a window, thin film optics should be considered.

# Normal Incidence

Since the computations become rather cumbersome, we shall limit ourselves to the simpler case of normal incidence  $(\theta = 0)$  . For more detailed discussions, including oblique incidence angles, the reader is referred to books on the subject such as the one by Knitt [7] or to the very readable monograph by Anders [8].

Consider the slab shown in Fig. 2- 12: The wave incident at the left interface is partially reflected, and partially transmitted toward the second interface. At the second interface, again, the wave is partially reflected and partially transmitted into Medium 3. The reflected part travels back to the first interface where a part is reflected back toward the second interface, and a part is transmitted into Medium 1, i.e., it is added to the reflected wave, etc. Therefore, the reflected wave  $\mathbf{E}_r$  and the transmitted wave  $\mathbf{E}_t$  consist of many contributions, and inside Medium 2 there are two waves  $\mathbf{E}_2^+$  and  $\mathbf{E}_2^-$  traveling into the directions  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$  and  $- \hat{\mathbf{n}}$ , respectively. Thus, the boundary conditions, equations (2.67) and (2.68), may be written for the first interface, similar to equations (2.82) through (2.85), as

$$
\begin{array}{r}z = \mathbf{r}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = 0:\qquad E_i + E_r = E_2^+ +E_2^-,\\ H_i + H_r = H_2^+ +H_2^-, \end{array} \tag{2.116}
$$

where polarization of the beam does not appear since at normal incidence  $E_{\parallel} = E_{\perp}$ . The magnetic field may again be eliminated using equation (2.25), as well as  $\mathbf{w}_i = - \mathbf{w}_r = \eta_0m_1\hat{\mathbf{n}}$  and  $\mathbf{w}^{+} = - \mathbf{w}^{- } = \eta_{0}m_{2}\hat{\mathbf{n}}$  [from equation (2.31)], or

$$
(E_{i} - E_{r})m_{1} = (E_{2}^{+} - E_{2}^{-})m_{2}. \tag{2.117}
$$

The boundary condition at the second interface follows [similar to equations (2.101) and (2.102)] as

$$
\begin{array}{r}z = \mathbf{r}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = d:\qquad E_2^+ e^{-2\pi i\eta_0m_2d} + E_2^- e^{+2\pi i\eta_0m_2d} = E_t e^{-2\pi i\eta_0m_3d}\\ (E_2^+ e^{-2\pi i\eta_0m_2d} - E_2^- e^{+2\pi i\eta_0m_2d})m_2 = E_t e^{-2\pi i\eta_0m_3d}m_3. \end{array} \tag{2.118}
$$

Equations (2.115), (2.117), (2.118), and (2.119) are four equations in the unknowns  $E_r$ ,  $E_2^+, E_2^-$ , and  $E_t$ , which may be solved for the reflection and transmission coefficients of a thin film. After some algebra one obtains

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\widetilde{r}_{\mathrm{film}} = \frac{E_r}{E_i} = \frac{\widetilde{r}_{12} + \widetilde{r}_{23}}{1 + \widetilde{r}_{12}\widetilde{r}_{23}} e^{-4\pi i\eta_0dm_2},}\\ & {\widetilde{t}_{\mathrm{film}} = \frac{E_t e^{-2\pi i\eta_0dm_3}}{E_i} = \frac{\widetilde{t}_{12}\widetilde{t}_{23}}{1 + \widetilde{r}_{12}\widetilde{r}_{23}} e^{-2\pi i\eta_0dm_2},} \end{array} \tag{2.121}
$$

where  $\widetilde{r}_{ij}$  and  $\widetilde{t}_{ij}$  are the complex reflection and transmission coefficients of the two interfaces,

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}\widetilde{r}_{12} = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2}, & \quad \widetilde{r}_{23} = \frac{m_2 - m_3}{m_2 + m_3};\\ \widetilde{t}_{12} = \frac{2m_1}{m_1 + m_2}, & \quad \widetilde{t}_{23} = \frac{2m_2}{m_2 + m_3}. \end{array} \tag{2.122b}
$$

To evaluate the thin film reflectivity and transmissivity from the complex coefficients, it is advantageous to write the coefficients in polar notation (cf., for example, Wylie [3]),

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l r} & {\widetilde{r}_{i j} = r_{i j}e^{i\delta_{i j}},} & & {r_{i j} = |\widetilde{r}_{i j}|,} & & {\tan \delta_{i j} = \frac{\widetilde{v}(\widetilde{r}_{i j})}{\mathfrak{R}(\widetilde{r}_{i j})},}\\ & {\widetilde{t}_{i j} = t_{i j}e^{i\epsilon_{i j}},} & & {t_{i j} = |\widetilde{t}_{i j}|,} & & {\tan \epsilon_{i j} = \frac{\widetilde{v}(\widetilde{t}_{i j})}{\mathfrak{R}(\widetilde{t}_{i j})},} \end{array} \tag{2.123b}
$$

where  $r_{ij}$  and  $t_{ij}$  are the absolute values, and  $\delta_{ij}$  and  $\epsilon_{ij}$  the phase angles of the coefficients. Care must be taken in the evaluation of phase angles, since the tangent has a period of  $\pi$ , rather than  $2\pi$ : The correct quadrant for  $\delta_{ij}$  and  $\epsilon_{ij}$  is found by inspecting the signs of the real and imaginary parts of  $\widetilde{r}_{ij}$  and  $\widetilde{t}_{ij}$ , respectively. This calculation leads, after more algebra, to the reflectivity,  $R_{\mathrm{film}}$ , and transmissivity,  $T_{\mathrm{film}}$ , of the thin film as

$$
\begin{array}{r}R_{\mathrm{film}} = \widetilde{rr^*} = \frac{r_{12}^2 + 2r_{12}r_{23}e^{-\kappa_2d}\cos(\delta_{12} - \delta_{23} + \zeta_2) + r_{23}^2e^{-2\kappa_2d}}{1 + 2r_{12}r_{23}e^{-\kappa_2d}\cos(\delta_{12} + \delta_{23} - \zeta_2) + r_{12}^2r_{23}^2e^{-2\kappa_2d}},\\ T_{\mathrm{film}} = \frac{n_3 - \widetilde{rr^*}}{n_1} = \frac{\tau_{12}\tau_{23}e^{-\kappa_2d}}{1 + 2r_{12}r_{23}e^{-\kappa_2d}\cos(\delta_{12} + \delta_{23} - \zeta_2) + r_{12}^2r_{23}^2e^{-2\kappa_2d}}, \end{array} \tag{2.124}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{c}{r_{ij}^2 = \rho_{ij} = \frac{(n_i - n_j)^2 + (k_i - k_j)^2}{(n_i + n_j)^2 + (k_i + k_j)^2},}\\ {\frac{n_j}{n_i} t_{ij}^2 = \tau_{ij} = \frac{n_i}{n_j}\frac{4(n_i^2 + k_i^2)}{(n_i + n_j)^2 + (k_i + k_j)^2},}\\ {\tan \delta_{ij} = \frac{2(n_ik_j - n_jk_i)}{n_i^2 + k_i^2 - (n_j^2 + k_j^2)},}\\ {\kappa_i = 4\pi \eta_0k_i,\quad \zeta_i = 4\pi \eta_0n_id.} \end{array} \tag{2.126b}
$$

The correct quadrant for  $\delta_{ij}$  is found by checking the sign of both the numerator and denominator in equation (2.126c) (which, while different from the real and imaginary parts of  $\widetilde{r}_{ij}$ , carry their signs). If both adjacent media,  $i$  and  $j$ , are dielectrics then  $\widetilde{r}_{ij} = r_{ij}$  is real. In that case we set  $\delta_{ij} = 0$  and let  $r_{ij}$  carry a sign. The definition of the thin film transmissivity includes the factor  $(n_{3} / n_{1})$ , since it is the magnitude of the transmitted and incoming Poynting vector, equation (2.42), that must be compared.

Example 2.6. Determine the reflectivity and transmissivity of a  $5\mu \mathrm{m}$  thick manganese sulfide (MnS) crystal  $(n = 2.68, k\ll 1)$ , suspended in air, for the wavelength range between  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $1.25\mu \mathrm{m}$ .

# Solution

Assuming  $n_1 = n_3 = 1, k_1 = k_2 = k_3 = 0$ , and  $n_2 = 2.68$  and substituting these into equations (2.126) leads to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{r_{12} = r_{23} = \frac{n_2 - 1}{n_2 + 1};\quad t_{12} = \frac{2}{n_2 + 1},\quad t_{23} = \frac{2n_2}{n_2 + 1};}\\ {\tan \delta_{12} = \frac{0}{1 - n_2^2} = 0;\quad \tan \delta_{23} = \frac{0}{n_2^2 - 1} = 0.} \end{array}
$$

Since the real part of  $\widetilde{r}_{12}$  is negative, i.e.,  $1 - n_2^2 < 0$ , it follows that  $\delta_{12} = \pi$ . By similar reasoning  $\delta_{23} = 0$ . Alternatively, since all media are dielectrics, we could have set  $\delta_{12} = \delta_{23} = 0$  and  $r_{12} = - r_{23}$ . Thus, with  $\kappa_2 = 0$ , the reflectivity and transmissivity of a dielectric thin film follow as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_{\mathrm{film}} = \frac{2\rho_{12}(1 - \cos\zeta_2)}{1 - 2\rho_{12}\cos\zeta_2 + \rho_{12}^2},}\\ {T_{\mathrm{film}} = \frac{\tau_{12}^2}{1 - 2\rho_{12}\cos\zeta_2 + \rho_{12}^2}.} \end{array} \tag{2.128}
$$

It is a simple matter to show that  $\tau_{12} = \tau_{23} = 1 - \rho_{12}$  and, therefore,  $R_{\mathrm{film}} + T_{\mathrm{film}} = 1$  for a dielectric medium. Substituting numbers for MnS gives  $\rho_{12} = 0.2084$  and

$$
R_{\mathrm{film}} = \frac{0.3995(1 - \cos\zeta_2)}{1 - 0.3995\cos\zeta_2},\quad T_{\mathrm{film}} = \frac{0.6005}{1 - 0.3995\cos\zeta_2},
$$

FIGURE 2-13 Normal reflectivity of a thin film with interference effects.

with  $\zeta_{2} = 4\pi n_{2}d\eta_{0} = 168.4\mu \mathrm{m}\eta_{0} = 168.4\mu \mathrm{m} / \lambda_{0}$ .  $R_{\mathrm{film}}$  and  $T_{\mathrm{film}}$  are periodic with a period of  $\Delta \eta_{0} = 2\pi /168.4\mu \mathrm{m} = 0.0373\mu \mathrm{m}^{- 1}$ . At  $\lambda_{0} = 1\mu \mathrm{m}$  this fact implies  $\Delta \lambda_{0} = \lambda_{0}^{2}\Delta \eta_{0} = 0.0373\mu \mathrm{m}$ . The reflectivity of the dielectric film in Fig. 2- 13 shows a periodic reflectivity with maxima of 0.5709 (at  $\zeta_{2} = \pi ,3\pi ,\ldots$ ). For values of  $\zeta_{2} = 2\pi ,4\pi ,\ldots$ , the reflectivity of the layer vanishes altogether. Also shown is the case of a slightly absorbing film, with  $k_{2} = 0.01$ . Maximum and minimum reflectivity (as well as transmissivity) decrease and increase somewhat, respectively. This effect is less pronounced at larger wavelengths, i.e., wherever the absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{2}$  is smaller [cf. equation (2.126d)].

While equations (2.124) through (2.126) are valid for arbitrary slab thicknesses, their application to thick slabs becomes problematic as well as unnecessary. Problematic because  $(i)$  for  $d\gg \lambda_0$  the period of reflectivity oscillations corresponds to smaller values of  $\Delta \lambda_0$  between extrema than can be measured, and  $(ii)$  for  $d\gg \lambda_0$  it becomes rather unlikely that the distance  $d$  remains constant within a fraction of  $\lambda_0$  over an extended area. Thick slab reflectivities and transmissivities may be obtained by averaging equations (2.124) and (2.125) over a period through integration, which results in

$$
\begin{array}{c}{R_{\mathrm{slab}} = \rho_{12} + \frac{\rho_{23}(1 - \rho_{12})^2e^{-2\kappa_2d}}{1 - \rho_{12}\rho_{23}e^{-2\kappa_2d}},}\\ {T_{\mathrm{slab}} = \frac{(1 - \rho_{12})(1 - \rho_{23})e^{-\kappa_2d}}{1 - \rho_{12}\rho_{23}e^{-2\kappa_2d}},} \end{array} \tag{2.130}
$$

where for  $T_{\mathrm{slab}}$  use has been made of the fact that  $k_{1}$  and  $k_{2}$  must be very small, if an appreciable amount of energy is to reach Medium 3. The same relations for thick sheets without wave interference will be developed in the following chapter through geometric optics.

# Oblique Incidence

Knittl [7] has shown that equations (2.124) and (2.125) remain valid for each polarization for oblique incidence if the interface reflectivities,  $\rho_{ij}$ , and transmissivities,  $\tau_{ij}$ , are replaced by their directional values; see, for example, equations (2.113). We will state the final result here, mostly following the development of Zhang [9]. The field reflection and transmission coefficients are then expressed as

$$
\widetilde{r} = \widetilde{r}_{12} + \frac{\widetilde{t}_{12}\widetilde{t}_{21}\widetilde{r}_{23}e^{-2i\beta}}{1 - \widetilde{r}_{21}\widetilde{r}_{23}e^{-2i\beta}}, \tag{2.131a}
$$

$$
\widetilde{t} = \frac{\widetilde{t}_{12}\widetilde{t}_{23}e^{-i\beta}}{1 - \widetilde{r}_{21}\widetilde{r}_{23}e^{-2i\beta}}, \tag{2.131b}
$$

which are known as Airy's formulae. Here the interface reflectivity and transmissivity coefficients are given by equations (2.89) through (2.92) for dielectrics, and by equations (2.111) and (2.112) for absorbing media, and the phase shift in Medium 2 is, for a dielectric film, calculated from

$$
\beta = 2\pi \eta_{0}n_{1}d\cos \theta_{2}. \tag{2.131c}
$$

The overall reflectivity of the film follows from

$$
R_{\mathrm{film}} = \widetilde{rr^{*}} = \left|\widetilde{r}_{12} + \frac{\widetilde{t}_{12}\widetilde{t}_{21}\widetilde{r}_{23}e^{-2i\beta}}{1 - \widetilde{r}_{21}\widetilde{r}_{23}e^{-2i\beta}}\right|^{2}, \tag{2.132}
$$

and, if Media 1 and 3 are dielectrics, the film transmissivity is evaluated as

$$
T_{\mathrm{film}} = \frac{n_3\cos\theta_3}{n_1\cos\theta_1} t\widetilde{t^*} = \frac{n_3\cos\theta_3}{n_1\cos\theta_1}\left|\frac{\widetilde{t_{12}}\widetilde{t_{23}}e^{-i\beta}}{1 - \widetilde{r_{21}}\widetilde{r_{23}}e^{-2i\beta}}\right|. \tag{2.133}
$$

As for single interfaces, for random polarization equations (2.132) and (2.133) are evaluated independently for parallel and perpendicular polarizations, followed by averaging.

# 2.6 THEORIES FOR OPTICAL CONSTANTS

If the radiative properties of a surface—absorptivity, emissivity, and reflectivity—are to be theoretically evaluated from electromagnetic wave theory, the complex index of refraction,  $m$ , must be known over the spectral range of interest. A number of classical and quantum mechanical dispersion theories have been developed to predict the phenomenological coefficients  $\epsilon$  (electrical permittivity) and  $\sigma_{e}$  (electrical conductivity) as functions of the frequency (or wavelength) of incident electromagnetic waves for a number of different interaction phenomena and types of surfaces. While the complex index of refraction,  $m = n - ik$ , is most convenient for the treatment of wave propagation, the complex dielectric function (or relative permittivity),  $\epsilon = \epsilon^{\prime} - i\epsilon^{\prime \prime}$ , is more appropriate when the microscopic mechanisms are considered that determine the magnitude of the phenomenological coefficients. The two sets of parameters are related by the expression

$$
\epsilon = \epsilon^{\prime} - i\epsilon^{\prime \prime} = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{0}} -i\frac{\sigma_{e}}{2\pi\nu\epsilon_{0}} = m^{2} \tag{2.134}
$$

[compare equations (2.31) through (2.35)] and, therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{c}\epsilon^{\prime} = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{0}} = n^{2} - k^{2},\\ \epsilon^{\prime \prime} = \frac{\sigma_{e}}{2\pi\nu\epsilon_{0}} = 2nk, \end{array} \tag{2.135b}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}{n^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(\epsilon^{\prime} + \sqrt{\epsilon^{\prime 2} + \epsilon^{\prime\prime 2}}\right),}\\ {k^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(-\epsilon^{\prime} + \sqrt{\epsilon^{\prime 2} + \epsilon^{\prime\prime 2}}\right),} \end{array} \tag{2.136b}
$$

where we have again assumed the medium to be nonmagnetic  $(\mu = \mu_{0})$

Any material may absorb or emit radiative energy at many different wavelengths as a result of impurities (presence of foreign atoms) and imperfections in the ionic crystal lattice. However, a number of phenomena tend to dominate the optical behavior of a substance. In the frequency

FIGURE 2-14Electron energy bands and band gaps in a solid (shading indicates amount of electrons filling the bands) [2].

range of interest to the heat transfer engineer (ultraviolet to midinfrared), electromagnetic waves are primarily absorbed by free and bound electrons or by change in the energy level of lattice vibration (converting a photon into a phonon, i.e., a quantum of lattice vibration). Since electricity is conducted by free electrons, and since free electrons are a major contributor to a solid's ability to absorb radiative energy, there are distinct optical differences between conductors and nonconductors of electricity. Every solid has a large number of electrons, resulting in a near- continuum of possible energy states (and, therefore, a near- continuum of photon frequencies that can be absorbed). However, these allowed energy states occur in bands. Between the bands of allowed energy states may be band gaps, i.e., energy states that the solid cannot attain. This is schematically shown in Fig. 2- 14. If a material has a band gap between completely filled and completely empty energy bands, the material is a nonconductor, i.e., an insulator (wide band gap), or a semiconductor (narrow band gap). If a band of electron energy states is incompletely filled or overlaps another, empty band, electrons can be excited into adjacent energy states resulting in an electric current, and the material is called a conductor. Electronic absorption by nonconductors is likely only for photons with energies greater than the band gap, although sometimes two or more photons may combine to bridge the band gap. An intraband transition occurs when an electron changes its energy level, but stays within the same band (which can only occur in a conductor); if an electron moves into a different band (i.e., overcomes the band gap) the movement is termed an interband transition (and can occur in both conductors and nonconductors). This difference between conductors and nonconductors causes substantially different optical behavior: Insulators tend to be transparent and weakly reflecting for photons with energies less than the band gap, while metals tend to be highly absorbing and reflecting between the visible and infrared wavelengths [2].

During the beginning of the century Lorentz  $[10]^{*}$  developed a classical theory for the evaluation of the dielectric function by assuming electrons and ions are harmonic oscillators (i.e., springs) subjected to forces from interacting electromagnetic waves. His result was equivalent to

![](images/e0167a59f7ecfb137abb01ee3f780f00eebcbe22f992258a3c1861d296d7f475.jpg)  
FIGURE 2-15 Lorentz model for (a) the dielectric function, (b) the index of refraction, and normal, spectral reflectivity.

the subsequent quantum mechanical development, and may be stated, as described by Bohren and Huffman [2], as

$$
\epsilon (\nu) = 1 + \sum_{j}\frac{\nu_{pj}^{2}}{\nu_{j}^{2} - \nu^{2} + i\gamma_{j}\nu}, \tag{2.137}
$$

where the summation is over different types of oscillators,  $\nu_{pj}$  is known as the plasma frequency (and  $\nu_{pj}^{2}$  is proportional to the number of oscillators of type  $j$ ),  $\nu_{j}$  is the resonance frequency, and  $\gamma_{j}$  is the damping factor of the oscillators. Thus, the dielectric function may have a number of bands centered at  $\nu_{j}$ , which may or may not overlap one another. Inspecting equation (2.137), we see that for  $\nu \gg \nu_{j}$  the contribution of band  $j$  to  $\epsilon$  vanishes, while for  $\nu \ll \nu_{j}$  it goes to the constant value of  $(\nu_{pj} / \nu_{j})^{2}$ . Therefore, for any nonoverlapping band  $i$ , we may rewrite equation (2.137) as

$$
\epsilon (\nu) = \epsilon_{0} + \frac{\nu_{pi}^{2}}{\nu_{i}^{2} - \nu^{2} + i\gamma_{i}\nu}, \tag{2.138}
$$

where  $\epsilon_{0}$  incorporates the contributions from all bands with  $\nu_{j} > \nu_{i}$ . Equation (2.138) may be separated into its real and imaginary components, or

$$
\begin{array}{l}\epsilon^{\prime} = \epsilon_{0} + \frac{\nu_{pi}^{2}(\nu_{i}^{2} - \nu^{2})}{(\nu_{i}^{2} - \nu^{2})^{2} + \gamma_{i}^{2}\nu^{2}},\\ \epsilon^{\prime \prime} = \frac{\nu_{pi}^{2}\gamma_{i}\nu}{(\nu_{i}^{2} - \nu^{2})^{2} + \gamma_{i}^{2}\nu^{2}}. \end{array} \tag{2.139a}
$$

The frequency dependence of the real and imaginary parts of the dielectric function for a single oscillating band is shown qualitatively in Fig. 2- 15; also shown are the corresponding curves for the real and imaginary parts of the complex index of refraction as evaluated from equation (2.136), along with the qualitative behavior of the normal, spectral reflectivity of a surface from equation (2.114). A strong band with  $k\gg 0$  results in a region with strong absorption around the resonance frequency and an associated region of high reflection: Incoming photons are mostly reflected, and those few that penetrate into the medium are rapidly attenuated. On either side outside the band the refractive index  $n$  increases with increasing frequency (or decreasing wavelength); this is called normal dispersion. However, close to the resonance frequency,  $n$  decreases with increasing frequency; this decrease is known as anomalous dispersion. Note that  $\epsilon^{\prime}$  may become negative, resulting in spectral regions with  $n< 1$ .

All solids and liquids may absorb photons whose energy content matches the energy difference between filled and empty electron energy levels on separate bands. Since such transitions

require a substantial amount of energy, they generally occur in the ultraviolet (i.e., at high frequency). A near- continuum of electron energy levels results in an extensive region of strong absorption (and often many overlapping bands). It takes considerably less energy to excite the vibrational modes of a crystal lattice, resulting in absorption bands in the midinfrared (around  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$ ). Since generally few different vibrational modes exist in an isotropic lattice, such transitions can often be modeled by equation (2.137) with a single band. In the case of electrical conductors photons may also be absorbed to raise the energy levels of free electrons and of bound electrons within partially filled or partially overlapping electron bands. The former, because of the nearly arbitrary energy levels that a free electron may assume, results in a single large band in the far infrared; the latter causes narrower bands in the ultraviolet to infrared.

# Problems

2.1 Show that for an electromagnetic wave traveling through a dielectric  $(m_{1} = n_{1})$ , impinging on the interface with another, optically less dense dense dielectric  $(n_{2}< n_{1})$ , light of any polarization is totally reflected for incidence angles larger than  $\theta_{c} = \sin^{-1}(n_{2} / n_{1})$ . Hint: Use equations (2.105) and (2.106) with  $k_{2} = 0$ .

2.2 Derive equations (2.109) using the same approach as in the development of equations (2.89) through (2.92).  Hint: Remember that within the absorbing medium,  $\mathbf{w} = \mathbf{w}^{\prime} - i\mathbf{w}^{\prime \prime} = v^{\prime}\hat{\mathbf{s}} - iw^{\prime \prime}\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ ; this implies that  $\mathbf{E}_{0}$  is not a vector normal to  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ . It is best to assume  $\mathbf{E}_{0} = E_{\parallel}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\parallel} + E_{\perp}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\perp} + E_{\mathrm{s}}\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ .

2.3 Find the normal spectral reflectivity at the interface between two absorbing media.

Hint: Use an approach similar to the one that led to equations (2.89) and (2.90), keeping in mind that all wave vectors will be complex, but that the wave will be homogeneous in both media, i.e., all components of the wave vectors are colinear with the surface normal.

2.4 A circularly polarized wave in air is incident upon a smooth dielectric surface  $(n = 1.5)$  with a direction of  $45^{\circ}$  off normal. What are the normalized Stokes' parameters before and after the reflection, and what are the degrees of polarization?

2.5 A circularly polarized wave in air traveling along the  $z$ - axis is incident upon a dielectric surface  $(n = 1.5)$ . How must the dielectric- air interface be oriented so that the reflected wave is a linearly polarized wave in the  $y - z$ - plane?

2.6 A polished platinum surface is coated with a  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$  thick layer of  $\mathrm{MgO}$ .

(a) Determine the material's reflectivity in the vicinity of  $\lambda = 2\mu \mathrm{m}$  (for platinum at  $2\mu \mathrm{m} m_{\mathrm{Pt}} = 5.29 - 6.71i$ , for  $\mathrm{MgO} m_{\mathrm{MgO}} = 1.65 - 0.0001i$ ).  
(b) Estimate the thickness of  $\mathrm{MgO}$  required to reduce the average reflectivity in the vicinity of  $2\mu \mathrm{m}$  to 0.4. What happens to the interference effects for this case?

# CHAPTER 3

# RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF REAL SURFACES

# 3.1 INTRODUCTION

Ideally, electromagnetic wave theory may be used to predict all radiative properties of any material (reflectivity and transmissivity at an interface, absorption and emission within a medium). For a variety of reasons, however, the usefulness of the electromagnetic wave theory is extremely limited in practice. For one, the theory incorporates a large number of assumptions that are not necessarily good for all materials. Most importantly, electromagnetic wave theory neglects the effects of surface conditions on the radiative properties of these surfaces, instead assuming optically smooth interfaces of precisely the same (homogeneous) material as the bulk material—conditions that are very rarely met in practice. In the real world surfaces of materials are generally coated to varying degree with contaminants, oxide layers, and the like, and they usually have a certain degree of roughness (which is rarely even known on a quantitative basis). Thus, the greatest usefulness of the electromagnetic wave theory is that it provides the engineer with a tool to augment sparse experimental data through intelligent interpolation and extrapolation. Still, it is important to realize that radiative properties of opaque materials depend exclusively on the makeup of a very thin surface layer and, thus, may, for the same material, change from batch to batch and, indeed, overnight. This behavior is in contrast to most other thermophysical properties, such as thermal conductivity, which are bulk properties and as such are insensitive to surface contamination, roughness, and so on. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, formerly NBS) has recommended to reserve the ending “- ivity” for radiative properties of pure, perfectly smooth materials (the ones discussed in the previous chapter), and “- ance” for rough and contaminated surfaces. Most real surfaces fall into the latter category, discussed in the present chapter. Consequently, we will use the ending “- ance” for the definitions in the following section, and for most surface properties throughout this chapter (and the remainder of this book), unless the surface in question is optically smooth and the property is obtained from electromagnetic wave theory. Note that there will be occasions when either term could be used (“almost smooth” surfaces, comparing experimental data with electromagnetic wave theory, etc.).

In the present chapter we shall first develop definitions of all radiative properties that are relevant for real opaque surfaces. We then apply electromagnetic wave theory to predict trends of radiative properties for metals and for dielectrics (electrical nonconductors). These theoretical results are compared with a limited number of experimental data. This is followed by a brief

discussion of phenomena that cannot be predicted by electromagnetic wave theory, such as the effects of surface roughness, of surface oxidation and contamination, and of the preparation of "special surfaces" (i.e., surfaces whose properties are customized through surface coatings and/or controlled roughness).

Most experimental data available today were taken in the 1950s and 1960s during NASA's "Golden Age," when considerable resources were directed toward sending a man to the moon. Interest waned, together with NASA's funding, during the 1970s and early 1980s. More recently, because of the development of high- temperature ceramics and high- temperature applications, there has been renewed interest in the measurement of radiative surface properties.

No attempt is made here to present a complete set of experimental data for radiative surface properties. Extensive data sets of such properties have been collected in a number of references, such as [1- 8], although all of these surveys are somewhat outdated.

The most basic radiative property for emission from an opaque surface is its spectral, directional emittance, defined as

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda ,\pmb {\hat{s}}_{o}) = \frac{I_{\lambda}(T,\lambda,\pmb{\hat{s}}_{o})\cos\theta_{o}d\Omega_{o}}{I_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda)\cos\theta_{o}d\Omega_{o}} = \frac{I_{\lambda}(T,\lambda,\pmb{\hat{s}}_{o})}{I_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda)}, \tag{3.1}
$$

which compares the actual spectral, directional emissive power with that of a black surface at the same conditions. We have added a prime to the letter  $\epsilon$  to distinguish the directional emittance from the hemispherical (i.e., directionally averaged) value, and the subscript  $\lambda$  to distinguish the spectral emittance from the total (i.e., spectrally averaged) value. The direction vector is denoted by  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o$  to emphasize that, for emission, we are considering directions away from a surface (outgoing). Finally, we have chosen wavelength  $\lambda$  as the spectral variable, since this is the preferred variable by most authors in the field of surface radiation phenomena. Expressions identical to equation (3.1) hold if frequency  $\nu$  or wavenumber  $\eta$  are employed.

Some typical trends for experimentally determined directional emittances for actual materials are shown in Fig. 3- 1a,b, as given by Schmidt and Eckert [9] (all emittances in these figures have been averaged over the entire spectrum; see the definition of the total, directional emittance below). For nonmetals the directional emittance varies little over a large range of polar angles but decreases rapidly at grazing angles until a value of zero is reached at  $\theta = \pi /2$ . Similar trends hold for metals, except that, at grazing angles, the emittance first increases sharply before dropping back to zero (not shown). Note that emittance levels are considerably higher for nonmetals.

A spectral surface whose emittance is the same for all directions is called a diffuse emitter, or a Lambert surface [since it obeys Lambert's law, equation (1.35)]. No real surface can be a diffuse emitter since electromagnetic wave theory predicts a zero emittance at  $\theta = \pi /2$  for all materials. However, little energy is emitted into grazing directions, as seen from equation (1.31), so that the assumption of diffuse emission is often a good one.

The spectral, hemispherical emittance, defined as

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}(T,\lambda)\equiv \frac{E_{\lambda}(T,\lambda)}{E_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda)}, \tag{3.2}
$$

compares the actual spectral emissive power (i.e., emission into all directions above the surface) with that of a black surface. The spectral, hemispherical emittance may be related to the

FIGURE 3-1 Directional variation of surface emittances (a) for several nonmetals and (b) for several metals [9].

directional one through equations (1.31) and (1.33),

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{\epsilon_{\lambda}(T,\lambda) = \frac{\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi / 2}I_{\lambda}(T,\lambda,\theta,\psi)\cos\theta\sin\theta d\theta d\psi}{\pi I_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda)}}\\ {= \frac{\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi / 2}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda,\theta,\psi)I_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda)\cos\theta\sin\theta d\theta d\psi}{\pi I_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda)},} \end{array} \tag{3.3}
$$

which may be simplified to

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}(T,\lambda) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi /2}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda ,\theta ,\psi)\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\psi , \tag{3.4}
$$

since  $I_{b\lambda}$  does not depend on direction. For an isotropic surface, i.e., a surface that has no different structure, composition, or behavior for different directions on the surface (azimuthal angle), equation (3.4) reduces to

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}(T,\lambda) = 2\int_{0}^{\pi /2}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda ,\theta)\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta . \tag{3.5}
$$

We note that the hemispherical emittance is an average over all solid angles subject to the weight factor  $\cos \theta$  (arising from the directional variation of emissive power). For a diffuse surface,  $\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}$  does not depend on direction and we find

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}(T,\lambda) = \epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda). \tag{3.6}
$$

The total, directional emittance is a spectral average of  $\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}$ , defined by

$$
\epsilon^{\prime}(T,\mathfrak{s}) = \frac{I(T,\mathfrak{s})\cos\theta d\Omega}{I_{b}(T)\cos\theta d\Omega} = \frac{I(T,\mathfrak{s})}{I_{b}(T)}, \tag{3.7}
$$

or, from equations (1.30) and (1.34),

$$
\epsilon^{\prime}(T,\mathfrak{s}) = \frac{1}{I_{b}}\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{\lambda}d\lambda = \frac{1}{I_{b}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}I_{b\lambda}d\lambda = \frac{1}{n^{2}\sigma T^{4}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda ,\mathfrak{s})E_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda)d\lambda . \tag{3.8}
$$

Finally, the total, hemispherical emittance is defined as

$$
\epsilon (T) = \frac{E(T)}{E_b(T)}, \tag{3.9}
$$

and may be related to the spectral, hemispherical emittance through

$$
\epsilon (T) = \frac{\int_0^\infty E_\lambda(T,\lambda)d\lambda}{E_b(T)} = \frac{1}{n^2\sigma T^4}\int_0^\infty \epsilon_\lambda (T,\lambda)E_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda)d\lambda . \tag{3.10}
$$

It is apparent that the total emittance is a spectral average with the spectral emissive power as a weight factor. If the spectral emittance is the same for all wavelengths then equation (3.10) reduces to

$$
\epsilon (T) = \epsilon_{\lambda}(T). \tag{3.11}
$$

Such surfaces are termed gray. If we have the very special case of a gray, diffuse surface, this implies

$$
\epsilon (T) = \epsilon_{\lambda} = \epsilon^{\prime} = \epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}. \tag{3.12}
$$

While no real surface is truly gray, it often happens that  $\epsilon_{\lambda}$  is relatively constant over that part of the spectrum where  $E_{b\lambda}$  is substantial, making the simplifying assumption of a gray surface warranted.

Example 3.1. A certain surface material has the following spectral, directional emittance when exposed to air:

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\lambda ,\theta) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0.9\cos \theta , & 0< \lambda < 2\mu \mathrm{m},\\ 0.3, & 2\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < \infty . \end{array} \right.
$$

Determine the total hemispherical emittance for a surface temperature of  $T = 500\mathrm{K}$

# Solution

We first determine the hemispherical, spectral emittance from equation (3.5) as

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}(\lambda) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}2\times 0.9\int_{0}^{\pi /2}\cos^{2}\theta \sin \theta d\theta = 0.6, & 0< \lambda < 2\mu \mathrm{m},\\ 2\times 0.3\int_{0}^{\pi /2}\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta = 0.3, & 2\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < \infty . \end{array} \right.
$$

The total, hemispherical emittance follows from equation (3.10) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\epsilon (T) = \frac{1}{n^2\sigma T^4}\int_{\lambda}^{\prime}(0.6\int_{0}^{2\mu \mathrm{m}}E_{b\lambda}d\lambda +0.3\int_{2\mu \mathrm{m}}^{\infty}E_{b\lambda}d\lambda) = 0.3 + \frac{0.6 - 0.3}{n^2\sigma T^4}\int_{0}^{2\mu \mathrm{m}}E_{b\lambda}d\lambda \\ = 0.3[1 + f(1\times 2\mu \mathrm{m}\times 500\mathrm{K})] = 0.3\times (1 + 0.00032)\simeq 0.3, \end{array}
$$

where the fractional blackbody emissive power  $f(n\lambda T)$  is as defined in equation (1.23). For a temperature of  $500\mathrm{K}$  the spectrum below  $2\mu \mathrm{m}$  is unimportant, and the surface is essentially gray and diffuse.

# Absorptance

Unlike emittance, absorptance (as well as reflectance and transmittance) is not truly a surface property, since it depends on the external radiation field, as seen from its definition, equation (1.51). As for emittance we distinguish between directional and hemispherical, as well as spectral and total absorptances.

The radiative heat transfer rate per unit wavelength impinging onto an infinitesimal area  $dA$ , from the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  over a solid angle of  $d\Omega_i$  is, as depicted in Fig. 3- 2,

$$
I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)(\cos \theta_idA)d\Omega_i,
$$

where we have used the definition of intensity as radiative heat transfer rate per unit area normal to the rays, and per unit solid angle.  $I_{\lambda}$  is the local radiative intensity at location  $\mathbf{r}$  (just above the surface). This incoming heat transfer rate, when evaluated per unit surface area  $dA$  and per unit incoming solid angle  $d\Omega_i$ , is known as spectral, directional irradiation,

$$
H_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\cos \theta_i. \tag{3.13}
$$

Irradiation is a heat flux always pointing into the surface. Thus, there is no need to attach a sign to its value, and it is evaluated as an absolute value (in contrast to the definition of net heat flux in Chapter 1). The spectral, directional absorptance at surface location  $\mathbf{r}$  is then defined as

$$
\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\equiv \frac{H_{\lambda,\mathrm{abs}}^{\prime}}{H_{\lambda}^{\prime}}, \tag{3.14}
$$

where  $H_{\lambda ,\mathrm{abs}}^{\prime}$  is that part of  $H_{\lambda}^{\prime}$  that is absorbed by  $dA$ . If local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails, the fraction  $\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}$  will not change if  $H_{\lambda}^{\prime}$  increases or decreases. Under this condition we find that the spectral, directional absorptance does not depend on the external radiation field and is a surface property that depends on local temperature, wavelength, and incoming direction. To determine its magnitude, we consider an isothermal spherical enclosure shown in Fig. 3- 3, similar to the one used in Section 1.6 to establish the directional isotropy of blackbody intensity. The enclosure coating is again perfectly reflecting except for a small area  $dA_s$ , which is also perfectly reflecting except over the wavelength interval between  $\lambda$  and  $\lambda + d\lambda$ , over which it is black. However, the small surface  $dA$  suspended at the center is now nonblack. Following the same arguments as for the development of equation (1.32), augmenting the emitted flux by  $\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}$  and the absorbed flux by  $\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}$ , we find immediately

$$
\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda ,\theta ,\psi) = \epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda ,\theta ,\psi). \tag{3.15}
$$

![](images/210c10f69340693e657cbe2c8b0cad010f28624a04ff4e8c675bc5632c933a41.jpg)  
FIGURE 3-3 Kirchhoff's law for the spectral, directional absorptance.

Therefore, if local thermodynamic equilibrium prevails, the spectral, directional absorptance is a true surface property and is equal to the spectral, directional emittance.

The spectral radiative heat flux incident on a surface per unit wavelength from all directions, i.e., from the hemisphere above  $dA$ , is

$$
H_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) = \int_{2\pi}H_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})d\Omega_{i} = \int_{2\pi}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos \theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}. \tag{3.16}
$$

Of this the amount absorbed is, from equation (3.14),

$$
\int_{2\pi}\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos \theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}.
$$

Thus, we define the spectral, hemispherical absorptance as

$$
\alpha_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda)\equiv \frac{H_{\lambda,\mathrm{abs}}}{H_{\lambda}} = \frac{\int_{2\pi}\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos\theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}}{\int_{2\pi}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos\theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}}. \tag{3.17}
$$

Since the incoming radiation,  $I_{\lambda}$ , depends on the radiation field of the surrounding enclosure, the spectral, hemispherical absorptance normally depends on the entire temperature field and is not a surface property. However, if the incoming radiation is approximately diffuse (i.e., if  $I_{\lambda}$  is independent of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i}$ ), then the  $I_{\lambda}$  may be moved outside the integrals in equation (3.17) and cancelled. Then

$$
\alpha_{\lambda}(T,\lambda) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi /2}\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda ,\theta_{i},\psi_{i})\cos \theta_{i}\sin \theta_{i}d\theta_{i}d\psi_{i}, \tag{3.18}
$$

or, using equations (3.4) and (3.15),

$$
\alpha_{\lambda}(T,\lambda) = \epsilon_{\lambda}(T,\lambda)\quad (\mathrm{diffuse~irradiation}). \tag{3.19}
$$

This equality also holds if  $\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime} = \epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}$  are independent of direction, in which case  $\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}$  can be removed from the integral. Therefore, spectral hemispherical absorptances and emittances are equal if (and only if) either the irradiation and/or the spectral, directional absorptance are diffuse (i.e., do not depend on incoming direction).

On the other hand, energy incident from a single distant source results in (near- ) parallel rays from a unique direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i}$ , such as irradiation from the sun or from a laser. This is known as collimated irradiation, and leads to

$$
H_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) = H_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\delta \Omega_{i} = I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos \theta_{i}\delta \Omega_{i} \tag{3.20}
$$

and

$$
\alpha_{\lambda}(T,\lambda) = \alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = \epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\quad (\mathrm{collimated~irradiation}). \tag{3.21}
$$

Thus, for collimated irradiation there is no difference between directional and hemispherical absorptances.

The total irradiation per unit area and per unit solid angle, but over all wavelengths, is

$$
H^{\prime}(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos \theta_{i}d\lambda . \tag{3.22}
$$

Thus, we may define a total, directional absorptance as

$$
\alpha^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\equiv \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty}\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})d\lambda}{\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})d\lambda}, \tag{3.23}
$$

where the factor  $\cos \theta_{i}$  has cancelled out since it does not depend on wavelength. Again,  $\alpha^{\prime}$  is not normally a surface property but depends on the entire radiation field. However, if the irradiation may be written as

$$
I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = C(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)I_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda), \tag{3.24}
$$

where  $C(\hat{\mathbf{s}})$  is an otherwise arbitrary function that does not depend on wavelength, i.e., if the incoming radiation is gray (based on the local surface temperature  $T$ ), then, from equations (3.8) and (3.15),

$$
\alpha^{\prime}(T,\theta ,\psi) = \epsilon^{\prime}(T,\theta ,\psi). \tag{3.25}
$$

Of course, this relation also holds if the surface is gray (i.e.,  $\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime} = \epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}$  do not depend on wavelength).

Finally, the total irradiation per unit area from all directions and over the entire spectrum is

$$
H(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{2\pi}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos \theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}d\lambda . \tag{3.26}
$$

Therefore, the total, hemispherical absorptance is defined as

$$
\alpha (\mathbf{r})\equiv \frac{H_{\mathrm{abs}}}{H} = \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty}\alpha_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda)H_{b}(\mathbf{r},\lambda)d\lambda}{\int_{0}^{\infty}H_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda)d\lambda} = \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{2\pi}\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos\theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}d\lambda}{\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{2\pi}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos\theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}d\lambda}. \tag{3.27}
$$

This absorptance is related to the total hemispherical emittance only for the very special cases of a gray, diffuse surface, equation (3.12), and/or diffuse and gray irradiation, i.e., if

$$
I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = Cl_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda), \tag{3.28}
$$

where  $T$  is the temperature of the surface and  $C$  is a constant. Under those conditions we find, again using equation (3.15),

$$
\alpha (T) = \epsilon (T). \tag{3.29}
$$

Example 3.2. Let the surface considered in the previous example be irradiated by the sun from a  $30^{\circ}$  off- normal direction (i.e., a vector pointing to the sun from the surface forms a  $30^{\circ}$  angle with the outward surface normal). Determine the relevant surface absorptance.

# Solution

Since the sun irradiates the surface from only one direction, but over the entire spectrum, we need to find the total, directional absorptance. From the last example, with  $\theta_{i} = 30^{\circ}$ , we have

$$
\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}\left(\lambda ,\theta_{i} = \frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0.45\sqrt{3}, & 0< \lambda < 2\mu \mathrm{m},\\ 0.3, & 2\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < \infty . \end{array} \right.
$$

Since we know that the sun behaves like a blackbody at a temperature of  $T_{\mathrm{sun}} = 5777\mathrm{K}$ , we also know the spectral behavior of the sunshine falling onto our surface, or

$$
I_{\lambda}(\lambda ,\theta_{i}) = C I_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{sun}},\lambda), \tag{3.30}
$$

where  $C$  is a proportionality constant independent of wavelength.<sup>1</sup> Substituting this into equation (3.23) leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}\alpha^{\prime}\left(\theta_{i} = \frac{\pi}{6}\right) = \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\lambda,\theta_{i})I_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{sun}},\lambda)d\lambda}{\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{sun}},\lambda)d\lambda}\\ = \frac{1}{n^{2}dT_{\mathrm{sun}}^{4}}\left[0.45\sqrt{3}\int_{0}^{2\mu \mathrm{m}}E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{sun}},\lambda)d\lambda +0.3\int_{2\mu \mathrm{m}}^{\infty}E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{sun}},\lambda)d\lambda \right]\\ = 0.3 + (0.45\sqrt{3} -0.3)f(1\times 2\times 5777) = 0.3 + (0.779 - 0.3)\times 0.93962 = 0.750. \end{array}
$$

In contrast to the previous example we find that at a temperature of  $5777\mathrm{K}$  the spectrum above  $2\mu \mathrm{m}$  is of very little importance, and the surface is again essentially gray.

We realize from this example that  $(i)$  if a surface is irradiated from a gray source at temperature  $T_{\mathrm{source}}$ , and  $(ii)$  if the spectral, directional emittance of the surface is independent of temperature (as it is for most surfaces with good degree of accuracy), then the total absorptance is equal to its total emittance evaluated at the source temperature, or

$$
\alpha = \epsilon (T_{\mathrm{source}}). \tag{3.31}
$$

This relation holds on a directional basis, and also for hemispherical values if the irradiation is diffuse.

# Reflectance

The reflectance of a surface depends on two directions: the direction of the incoming radiation,  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,$  and the direction into which the reflected energy travels,  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r$  . Therefore, we distinguish between total and spectral values, and between a number of directional reflectances. The heat flux per unit wavelength impinging on an area  $dA$  from a direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  over a solid angle of  $d\Omega_{i}$  was given by equation (3.13) as

$$
H_{i}^{\prime}d\Omega_{i} = I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos \theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}. \tag{3.32}
$$

Of this, the finite fraction  $\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}$  will be absorbed by the surface (assuming it to be opaque), and the rest will be reflected into all possible directions (total solid angle  $2\pi$  ). Therefore, in general, only an infinitesimal fraction will be reflected into an infinitesimal cone of solid angle  $d\Omega_r$  around direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r,$  as shown in Fig. 3- 4. Denoting this fraction by  $\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r)d\Omega_r$  we obtain the reflected energy within the cone  $d\Omega_r$  as

$$
dI_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r)d\Omega_r = (H_{\lambda}^{\prime}d\Omega_i)\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r)d\Omega_r. \tag{3.33}
$$

The spectral, bidirectional reflection function<sup>2</sup>  $\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r)$  is directly proportional to the magnitude of reflected light that travels into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r$ ,

$$
\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r) = \frac{dI_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r)}{I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\cos\theta_id\Omega_i}. \tag{3.34}
$$

FIGURE 3-4 The bidirectional reflection function.

Equation (3.34) is the most basic of all radiation properties: All other radiation properties of an opaque surface can be related to it. However, experimental determination of this function for all materials, temperatures, wavelengths, incoming directions, and outgoing directions would be a truly Herculean task, limiting its practicality.

One may readily show that the law of reciprocity holds for the spectral, bidirectional reflection function (cf. McNicholas [10] or Siegel and Howell [11]),

$$
\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r) = \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda , - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_r, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i), \tag{3.35a}
$$

or

$$
\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\theta_{i},\psi_{i},\theta_{r},\psi_{r}) = \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\theta_{r},\psi_{r},\theta_{i},\psi_{i}). \tag{3.35b}
$$

This is done with another variation of Kirchhoff's law by placing a surface element into an isothermal black enclosure and evaluating the net heat transfer rate—which must be zero—between two arbitrary, infinitesimal surface elements on the enclosure wall. The sign change on the right- hand side of equation (3.35) emphasizes that  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  points into the surface, while  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r$  points away from it. Examination of equation (3.34) shows that  $0 \leq \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime} < \infty$ . Reaching the limit of  $\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime} \rightarrow \infty$  implies that a finite fraction of  $H_{\lambda}^{\prime}$  is reflected into an infinitesimal cone of solid angle  $d\Omega_r$ . Such ideal behavior is achieved by an optically smooth surface, resulting in specular reflection (perfect mirror). For a specular reflector we have  $\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime} = 0$  for all  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r$  except the specular direction  $\theta_r = \theta_i$ ,  $\psi_r = \psi_i + \pi$ , for which  $\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime} \rightarrow \infty$  (see Fig. 3- 4).

Some measurements by Torrance and Sparrow [12] for the bidirectional reflection function are shown in Fig. 3- 5 for magnesium oxide, a material widely used in radiation experiments because of its diffuse reflectance, as defined in equation (3.38) below, in the near infrared (discussed in the last part of this chapter). The data in Fig. 3- 5 are for an average surface roughness of  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$  and are normalized with respect to the value in the specular direction. It is apparent that the material reflects rather diffusely at shorter wavelengths, but displays strong specular peaks for  $\lambda > 2\mu \mathrm{m}$ .

A property of greater practical importance is the spectral, directional- hemispherical reflectance, which is defined as the total reflected heat flux leaving  $dA$  into all directions due to the spectral, directional irradiation  $H_{\lambda}^{\prime}$ . With the reflected intensity (i.e., reflected energy per unit area normal to  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r$ ) given by equation (3.33), we have, after multiplying with  $\cos \theta_r$ ,

$$
\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \sigma}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\equiv \frac{\int_{2\pi}dI_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r)\cos\theta_rd\Omega_r}{H_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)d\Omega_i}, \tag{3.36}
$$

or

\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \sigma}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = \int_{2\pi}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r)\cos \theta_r d\Omega_r, \tag{3.37}
$$

where the  $(H_{\lambda}^{\prime}d\Omega_{i})$  cancels out since it does not depend on outgoing direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r$ . Here we have temporarily added the superscript  $\sigma_{\alpha}^{\prime \prime}$  to distinguish the directional- hemispherical reflectance  $(\rho^{\prime \sigma})$  from the hemispherical- directional reflectance  $(\rho^{\sigma^{\prime}}$ , defined below). If the reflection function is independent of both  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r$ , then the surface reflects equal amounts into all directions, regardless of incoming direction, and

\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \sigma}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) = \pi \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda). \tag{3.38}
$$

Such a surface is called a diffuse reflector.

Comparing the definition of the spectral, directional- hemispherical reflectance with that of the spectral, directional absorptance, equation (3.14), we also find, for an opaque surface,

$$
\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \sigma}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = 1 - \alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i). \tag{3.39}
$$

Sometimes it is of interest to determine the amount of energy reflected into a certain direction, coming from all possible incoming directions. Equation (3.33) gives the reflected intensity due to a single incoming direction. Integrating this expression over the entire hemisphere of incoming directions leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r) = \int_{2\pi}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r)H_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)d\Omega_i}\\ {= \int_{2\pi}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r)I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\cos \theta_id\Omega_i.} \end{array} \tag{3.40}
$$

On the other hand, the spectral, hemispherical irradiation is

$$
H_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) = \int_{2\pi}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\cos \theta_id\Omega_i. \tag{3.41}
$$

If the surface were a perfect reflector, it would reflect all of  $H_{\lambda}$ , and it would reflect it equally into all outgoing directions. Thus, for the ideal case, the outgoing intensity would be, from equation (1.34),  $H_{\lambda} / \pi$ . Consequently, the spectral, hemispherical- directional reflectance is defined as

$$
\rho_{\lambda}^{\sigma^{\prime}}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{r})\equiv \frac{I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{r})}{H_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) / \pi} = \frac{\int_{2\pi}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{r})I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos\theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}}{\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{2\pi}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos\theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}}. \tag{3.42}
$$

For the special case of diffuse irradiation (i.e., the incoming intensity does not depend on  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$ ) equation (3.42) reduces to

$$
\rho_{\lambda}^{\sigma^{\prime}}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{r}) = \int_{2\pi}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{r})\cos \theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}, \tag{3.43}
$$

which is identical to equation (3.37) if the reciprocity of the bidirectional reflection function, equation (3.35), is invoked. Thus, for diffuse irradiation,

$$
\rho_{\lambda}^{\sigma^{\prime}}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{r}) = \rho_{\lambda}^{\sigma^{\prime}}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i}),\quad \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i} = -\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{r}, \tag{3.44a}
$$

or

$$
\rho_{\lambda}^{\sigma^{\prime}}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\theta_{r},\psi_{r}) = \rho_{\lambda}^{\sigma^{\prime}}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\theta_{i} = \theta_{r},\psi_{i} = \psi_{r}), \tag{3.44b}
$$

that is, reciprocity exists between the spectral directional- hemispherical and hemispherical- directional reflectances for any given irradiation/reflection direction. Use of this fact is often made in experimental measurements: While the directional- hemispherical reflectance is of great practical importance, it is very difficult to measure; the hemispherical- directional reflectance, on the other hand, is not very important but readily measured (see Section 3.10).

Finally, we define a spectral, hemispherical reflectance as the fraction of the total irradiation from all directions reflected into all directions. From equation (3.36) we have the heat flux reflected into all directions for a single direction of incidence,  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$ , as

$$
\rho_{\lambda}^{\sigma^{\prime}}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})H_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})d\Omega_{i}.
$$

Integrating this expression as well as  $H_{\lambda}^{\prime}$  itself over all incidence angles gives

$$
\rho_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) = \frac{\int_{2\pi}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime\sigma}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})H_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})d\Omega_{i}}{\int_{2\pi}H_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})d\Omega_{i}} = \frac{\int_{2\pi}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime\sigma}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos\theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}}{\int_{2\pi}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos\theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}}. \tag{3.45}
$$

If the incident intensity is independent of direction (diffuse irradiation), then equation (3.45) may be simplified again, and

$$
\rho_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{2\pi}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \sigma}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\cos \theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}. \tag{3.46}
$$

Also, comparing the definitions of spectral, hemispherical absorptance and reflectance, we obtain, for an opaque surface,

$$
\rho_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) = 1 - \alpha_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda). \tag{3.47}
$$

Finally, as for emittance and absorptance we need to introduce spectrally- integrated or "total" reflectances. This is done by integrating numerator and denominator independently over the full spectrum for each of the spectral reflectances, leading to the following relations: Total, bidirectional reflection function

$$
\rho ''(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r) = \frac{\int_0^\infty\rho_\lambda''(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r)I_\lambda(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)d\lambda}{\int_0^\infty I_\lambda(\mathbf{r},\lambda,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)d\lambda}; \tag{3.48}
$$

# 3.3 PREDICTIONS FROM ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVE THEORY

In Chapter 2 we developed in some detail how the spectral, directional- hemispherical reflectivity of an optically smooth interface (specular reflector) can be predicted by the electromagnetic wave and dispersion theories. Before comparing such predictions with experimental data, we shall briefly summarize the results of Chapter 2.

Consider an electromagnetic wave traveling through air (refractive index  $= 1$  ), hitting the surface of a conducting medium (complex index of refraction  $m = n - ik)$  at an angle of  $\theta_{1}$  with the surface normal (cf. Fig. 3- 6). Fresnel's relations predict the reflectivities for parallel- and perpendicular- polarized light from equations (2.107) through  $(2.113)^{3}$  as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\rho_{\parallel} = \frac{(p - \sin\theta_1\tan\theta_1)^2 + q^2}{(p + \sin\theta_1\tan\theta_1)^2 + q^2}\rho_{\perp},}\\ {\rho_{\perp} = \frac{(\cos\theta_1 - p)^2 + q^2}{(\cos\theta_1 + p)^2 + q^2},} \end{array} \tag{3.53}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{l}{p^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left[\sqrt{(n^2 - k^2 - \sin^2\theta_1)^2 + 4n^2k^2} +(n^2 -k^2 -\sin^2\theta_1)\right],}\\ {q^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left[\sqrt{(n^2 - k^2 - \sin^2\theta_1)^2 + 4n^2k^2} -(n^2 -k^2 -\sin^2\theta_1)\right].} \end{array} \tag{3.54}
$$

Nonreflected light is refracted into the medium, traveling on at an angle of  $\theta_{2}$  with the surface normal, as predicted by the generalized Snell's law, from equation (2.108),

$$
p\tan \theta_2 = \sin \theta_1. \tag{3.56}
$$

![](images/7803223f4a8993f28db65180ea39d30fc9068ca006dfdc96feef70f1e8c8ddbf.jpg)  
FIGURE 3-6 Transmission and reflection at an interface between air and an absorbing medium.

For normal incidence  $\theta_{1} = \theta_{2} = 0$ , and equations (3.52) through (3.55) simplify to  $p = n$ ,  $q = k$ , and

$$
\rho_{n\lambda} = \rho_{\parallel} = \rho_{\perp} = \frac{(n - 1)^2 + k^2}{(n + 1)^2 + k^2}. \tag{3.57}
$$

If the incident radiation is unpolarized, the reflectivity may be calculated as an average, i.e.,

$$
\begin{array}{r}\rho = \frac{1}{2} (\rho_{\parallel} + \rho_{\perp}). \end{array} \tag{3.58}
$$

For a dielectric medium  $(k = 0)$ ,  $p^2 = n^2 - \sin^2\theta_1$ , and Snell's law becomes

$$
n\sin \theta_2 = \sin \theta_1. \tag{3.59}
$$

Therefore,  $p = n\cos \theta_2$  and, with  $q = 0$ , Fresnel's relations reduce to

$$
\begin{array}{r}\rho_{\parallel} = \left(\frac{\cos\theta_2 - n\cos\theta_1}{\cos\theta_2 + n\cos\theta_1}\right)^2,\\ \rho_{\perp} = \left(\frac{\cos\theta_1 - n\cos\theta_2}{\cos\theta_1 + n\cos\theta_2}\right)^2. \end{array} \tag{3.60b}
$$

Except for the section on semitransparent sheets, in this chapter we shall be dealing with opaque media. For such media  $\rho +\alpha = 1$  and, from Kirchhoff's law,

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime} = \alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime} = 1 - \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime}. \tag{3.61}
$$

To predict radiative properties from electromagnetic wave theory, the complex index of refraction,  $m$ , must be known, either from direct measurements or from dispersion theory predictions. In the dispersion theory the complex dielectric function,  $\epsilon = \epsilon^{\prime} - i\epsilon^{\prime \prime}$ , is predicted by assuming that the surface material consists of harmonic oscillators interacting with electromagnetic waves. The complex dielectric function is related to the complex index of refraction by  $\epsilon = m^2$ , or

$$
\begin{array}{l}{n^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(\epsilon ' + \sqrt{\epsilon''^2 + \epsilon''^2}\right),}\\ {k^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(-\epsilon ' + \sqrt{\epsilon''^2 + \epsilon''^2}\right),} \end{array} \tag{3.62b}
$$

where

$$
\epsilon^{\prime} = \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{0}},\quad \epsilon^{\prime \prime} = \frac{\sigma_{e}}{2\pi\nu\epsilon_{0}};
$$

$\epsilon$  is the electrical permittivity,  $\epsilon_0$  is its value in vacuum, and  $\sigma_{e}$  is the medium's electrical conductivity. Both  $\epsilon$  and  $\sigma_{e}$  are functions of the frequency of the electromagnetic wave  $\nu$ . For an isolated oscillator (nonoverlapping band)  $\epsilon$  is predicted by the Lorentz model, equation (2.139), as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\epsilon^{\prime} = \epsilon_{0} + \frac{\nu_{pi}^{2}(\nu_{i}^{2} - \nu^{2})}{(\nu_{i}^{2} - \nu^{2})^{2} + \gamma_{i}^{2}\nu^{2}},\\ \epsilon^{\prime \prime} = \frac{\nu_{pi}^{2}\gamma_{i}\nu}{(\nu_{i}^{2} - \nu^{2})^{2} + \gamma_{i}^{2}\nu^{2}}, \end{array} \tag{3.63b}
$$

where  $\epsilon_0$  is the contribution to  $\epsilon^{\prime}$  from bands at shorter wavelengths,  $\nu_{i}$  is the resonance frequency,  $\nu_{pi}$  is called the plasma frequency, and  $\gamma_{i}$  is an oscillation damping factor. If these three constants can be determined or measured, then  $n$  and  $k$  can be predicted for all frequencies (or wavelengths) from equation (3.62), and the radiative properties can be calculated for all frequencies (or wavelengths) and all directions from equations (3.52) through (3.55).

# 3.4 RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF METALS

In this section we shall briefly discuss how the radiative properties of clean and smooth metallic surfaces (i.e., electrical conductors) can be predicted from electromagnetic wave theory and dispersion theory, and how these predictions compare with experimental data. The variation of the spectral, normal reflectance with wavelength and total, normal properties will be examined, followed by a discussion of the directional dependence of radiative properties and the evaluation of hemispherical reflectances (and emittances). Finally, we will look at the temperature dependence of spectral as well as total properties.

# Wavelength Dependence of Spectral, Normal Properties

Metals are in general excellent electrical conductors because of an abundance of free electrons. Drude [13] developed an early theory to predict the dielectric function for free electrons that is essentially a special case of the Lorentz model: Since free electrons do not oscillate but propagate freely, they may be modeled as a "spring" with a vanishing spring constant leading to a resonance frequency of  $\nu_{i} = 0$ . Thus the Drude theory for the dielectric function for free electrons follows from equation (3.63) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\epsilon^{\prime}(\nu) = \epsilon_{0} - \frac{\nu_{p}^{2}}{\nu^{2} + \gamma^{2}},\\ \epsilon^{\prime \prime}(\nu) = \frac{\nu_{p}^{2}\gamma}{\nu(\nu^{2} + \gamma^{2})}. \end{array} \tag{3.64b}
$$

Figure 3- 7 shows the spectral, normal reflectivity of three metals—aluminum, copper, and silver. The theoretical lines are from Ehrenreich and coworkers [14] (aluminum) and Ehrenreich and Phillip [15] (copper and silver), who semiempirically determined the values of the unknowns  $\epsilon_0$ ,  $\nu_{p}$ , and  $\gamma$  in equation (3.64). The experimental reflectance data are taken from Shiles and coworkers [16] (aluminum) and Hagemann and coworkers [17] (copper and silver). The agreement between experiment and theory in the infrared is very good. For wavelengths

![](images/ccb27834020f19fc36790945f7c3b2635d2f31bd811a1240b9527f0ee2d9a3ff.jpg)  
FIGURE 3-7 Spectral, normal reflectivity at room temperature for aluminum, copper, and silver.

$\lambda >1\mu \mathrm{m}$  the Drude theory has been shown to represent the reflectivity of many metals accurately, if samples are prepared with great care. Discrepancies are due to surface preparation methods and the limits of experimental accuracy. Aluminum has a dip in reflectivity centered at  $\sim 0.8\mu \mathrm{m};$  this is due to bound electron transitions that are not considered by the Drude model. Since  $\gamma \ll \nu_{p}$  always, there exists for each metal a frequency in the vicinity of the plasma frequency,  $\nu \simeq \nu_{p},$  where  $\epsilon^{\prime \prime} = 1$  and  $\epsilon^{\prime \prime}\ll 1$  or  $n\geq 1,k\ll 1$  : This fact implies that many metals neither reflect nor absorb radiation in the ultraviolet near  $\nu_{p},$  but are highly transparent!

For extremely long wavelengths (very small frequency  $\nu$ ), we find from equations (3.64) and (2.134) that

$$
\epsilon^{\prime \prime} = \frac{\nu_p^2}{\nu\gamma} = \frac{\sigma_e}{2\pi\nu\epsilon_0},\qquad \nu \ll \gamma , \tag{3.65}
$$

where  $\sigma_{e}$  is the (in general, frequency- dependent) electrical conductivity, and

$$
\sigma_{e} = 2\pi \epsilon_{0}\nu_{p}^{2} / \gamma = \mathrm{const} = \sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}. \tag{3.66}
$$

Note that at the long- wavelength limit the electrical conductivity becomes independent of wavelength and is known as the  $dc$ - conductivity. Since the  $dc$ - conductivity is easily measured it is advantageous to recast equation (3.64) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\epsilon (\nu) = \epsilon_0 - \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}\gamma / 2\pi\epsilon_0}{\nu(\nu + i\gamma)},\\ \displaystyle \epsilon ' = \epsilon_0 - \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}\gamma / 2\pi\epsilon_0}{\nu^2 + \gamma^2},\\ \displaystyle \epsilon '' = \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}\gamma^2 / 2\pi\epsilon_0}{\nu(\nu^2 + \gamma^2)}. \end{array} \tag{3.67b}
$$

Room temperature values for electrical resistivity,  $1 / \sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}$ , and for electron relaxation time,  $1 / 2\pi \gamma$ , have been given by Parker and Abbott [18] for a number of metals. They have been converted and are reproduced in Table 3.3. Note that these values differ appreciably from those given in Fig. 3- 7. No values for  $\epsilon_0$  are given; however, the influence of  $\epsilon_0$  is generally negligible in the

infrared. Extensive sets of spectral data for a large number of metals have been collected by Ordal and coworkers [19] (for a smaller number of metals they also give the Drude parameters, which are also conflicting somewhat with the data of Table 3.3), while a listing of spectral values of the complex index of refraction for a large numbers of metals and semiconductors has been given in a number of handbooks [20- 23].

For long wavelengths equation (3.62) may be simplified considerably, since for such case,  $c^{\prime \prime}\gg |c^{\prime}|,$  and it follows that

$$
n^2\approx k^2\approx \epsilon '' / 2 = \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}}{4\pi\nu\epsilon_0} = \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}\lambda_0}{4\pi c_0\epsilon_0}\gg 1, \tag{3.68}
$$

where  $\lambda_0$  is the wavelength in vacuum. Substituting values for the universal constants  $c_0$  and  $\epsilon_0$ , equation (3.68) becomes

$$
n\simeq k\simeq \sqrt{30\lambda_0\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}},\quad \lambda_0\mathrm{~in~cm},\quad \sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}\mathrm{~in~}\Omega^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-1}, \tag{3.69}
$$

which is known as the Hagen- Rubens relation [24]. For comparison, results from equation (3.69) are also included in Fig. 3- 7. It is commonly assumed that the Hagen- Rubens relation may be used for  $\lambda_0 > 6\mu \mathrm{m}$ , although this assumption can lead to serious errors, in particular as far as evaluation of the index of refraction is concerned. While equation (3.69) is valid for the metal being adjacent to an arbitrary material, we will—for notational simplicity—assume for the rest of this discussion that the adjacent material has a refractive index of unity (vacuum or gas), that is,  $\lambda_0 = \lambda$ . Substituting equation (3.69) into equation (3.57) leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}\rho_{n\lambda} = \frac{2n^2 - 2n + 1}{2n^2 + 2n + 1},\\ \displaystyle \epsilon_{n\lambda} = 1 - \rho_{n\lambda} = \frac{4n}{2n^2 + 2n + 1}. \end{array} \tag{3.70}
$$

Since  $n\gg 1$  equation (3.71) may be further simplified to

$$
\epsilon_{n\lambda} = \frac{2}{n} -\frac{2}{n^2} +\dots , \tag{3.72a}
$$

and, with equation (3.69), to

$$
\epsilon_{n\lambda}\simeq \frac{2}{\sqrt{30\lambda\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}}} -\frac{1}{15\lambda\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}},\quad \lambda \mathrm{~in~cm},\quad \sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}\mathrm{~in~}\Omega^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-1}. \tag{3.72b}
$$

This  $1 / \sqrt{\lambda}$  dependence is not predicted by the Drude theory (except for the far infrared), nor is it observed with optically smooth surfaces. However, it often approximates the behavior of polished (i.e., not entirely smooth) surfaces.

Example 3.3. Using the constants given in Fig. 3- 7 calculate the complex index of refraction and the normal, spectral reflectivity of silver at  $\lambda = 6.2\mu \mathrm{m}$ , using  $(a)$  the Drude theory, and  $(b)$  the Hagen- Rubens relation.

# Solution

(a) From Fig. 3-7 we have for silver  $\epsilon_0 = 3.4$ ,  $\nu_{p} = 2.22\times 10^{15}\mathrm{Hz}$ , and  $\gamma = 4.30\times 10^{12}\mathrm{Hz}$ . Substituting these into equation (3.64) with  $\nu = \epsilon_0 / \lambda = 2.998\times 10^8\mathrm{m / s}\times (10^6\mu \mathrm{m / m}) / 6.2\mu \mathrm{m} = 4.84\times 10^{12}\mathrm{Hz}$ , we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l}\epsilon^{\prime} = 3.4 - \frac{(2.22\times 10^{15})^{2}}{(4.84\times 10^{13})^{2} + (4.30\times 10^{12})^{2}} = 3.4 - 2087 = -2084,\\ \epsilon^{\prime \prime} = 2087\times 4.30\times 10^{12}\big / 4.84\times 10^{13} = 1851. \end{array}
$$

The complex index of refraction follows from equation (3.62) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{n^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(-2084 + \sqrt{2084^2 + 185.1^2}\right) = 4.102,}\\ {k^2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(2084 + \sqrt{2084^2 + 185.1^2}\right) = 2088,} \end{array}
$$

or  $n = 2.03$  and  $k = 45.7$ . Finally, the normal reflectivity follows from equation (3.57) as

$$
\rho_{n\lambda} = \frac{(1 - 2.03)^2 + 45.7^2}{(1 + 2.03)^2 + 45.7^2} = 0.996.
$$

(b) Using the Hagen-Rubens relation we find, from equation (3.66), that

$$
\begin{array}{l}\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}} = 2n\times 8.8542\times 10^{-12}\frac{\mathrm{C}^2}{\mathrm{Nm}^2}\times \left(2.22\times 10^{15}\mathrm{Hz}\right)^2\big / 4.30\times 10^{12}\mathrm{Hz}\\ = 6.376\times 10^7\frac{\mathrm{C}^2}{\mathrm{Nm}^2\mathrm{s}} = 6.376\times 10^7\Omega^{-1}\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 6.376\times 10^5\Omega^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-1}. \end{array}
$$

Substituting this value into equation (3.69) yields

$$
n = k = \sqrt{30\times 6.2\times 10^{-4}\times 6.376\times 10^{5}} = 108.9,
$$

and

$$
\rho_{n\lambda} = 1 - \epsilon_{n\lambda} = 1 - \frac{2}{n} +\frac{2}{n^2} = 1 - \frac{2}{108.9} +\frac{2}{108.9^2} = 0.982.
$$

The two sets of results may be compared with experimental results of  $n = 2.84$ ,  $k = 45.7$  and  $\rho_{n\lambda} = 0.995$  [17]. At first glance the Hagen- Rubens prediction for  $\rho_{n\lambda}$  appears very good because, for any  $k\gg 1$ ,  $\rho_{n\lambda}\approx 1$ . The values for  $n$  and  $k$  show that the Hagen- Rubens relation is in serious error even at a relatively long wavelength of  $\lambda = 6.2\mu \mathrm{m}$ .

# Total Properties for Normal Incidence

The total, normal reflectance and emittance may be evaluated from equation (3.8), with spectral, normal properties evaluated from the Drude theory or from the simple Hagen- Rubens relation. While the Hagen- Rubens relation is not very accurate, it does predict the emittance trends correctly in the infrared, and it does allow an explicit evaluation of total, normal emittance. Substituting equation (3.72) into equation (3.8) leads to an integral that may be evaluated in a similar fashion as for the total emissive power, equation (1.19), and, retaining the first three terms of the series expansion

$$
\epsilon_{n} = 0.578(T / \sigma_{\mathrm{dc}})^{1 / 2} - 0.178(T / \sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}) + 0.0584(T / \sigma_{\mathrm{dc}})^{3 / 2},\quad T\mathrm{~in~K,~}\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}\mathrm{~in~}\Omega^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-1}. \tag{3.73}
$$

FIGURE 3-8 Total, normal emittance of various polished metals as a function of temperature [18].

Of course, equation (3.73) is only valid for small values of  $(T / \sigma_{\mathrm{dc}})$ , i.e., the temperature of the surface must be such that only a small fraction of the blackbody emissive power comes from short wavelengths (where the Hagen- Rubens relation is not applicable). For pure metals, to a good approximation, the dc- conductivity is inversely proportional to absolute temperature, or

$$
\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}} = \sigma_{\mathrm{ref}}\frac{T_{\mathrm{ref}}}{T}. \tag{3.74}
$$

Therefore, for low enough temperatures, the total, normal emittance of a pure metal should be approximately linearly proportional to temperature. Comparison with experiment (Fig. 3- 8) shows that this nearly linear relationship holds for many metals up to surprisingly high temperatures; for example, for platinum  $(T / \sigma_{\mathrm{dc}})^{1 / 2} = 0.5$  corresponds to a temperature of  $2700\mathrm{K}$ . It is interesting to note that spectral integration of the Drude model results in  $30\%$  to  $70\%$  lower total emissivities for all metals and, thus, fails to follow experimental trends. Such integration was carried out by Parker and Abbott [18] in an approximate fashion. They attributed the discrepancy to imperfections in the molecular lattice induced by surface preparation and to the anomalous skin effect [25], both of which lower the electrical conductivity in the surface layer.

# Directional Dependence of Radiative Properties

The spectral, directional reflectivity at the interface between an absorber and a nonabsorber is given by Fresnel's relations, (3.52) through (3.55). Since, in the infrared,  $n$  and  $k$  are generally fairly large for metals one may with little error neglect the  $\sin^2\theta_1$  in equations (3.54) and (3.55), leading to  $p \simeq n$  and  $q \simeq k$ . Then, from equations (3.52) and (3.53) the reflectivities for parallel- and perpendicular- polarized light are evaluated from<sup>4</sup>

$$
\begin{array}{c}\rho_{\parallel} = \frac{(n\cos\theta - 1)^2 + (k\cos\theta)^2}{(n\cos\theta + 1)^2 + (k\cos\theta)^2},\\ \rho_{\perp} = \frac{(n - \cos\theta)^2 + k^2}{(n + \cos\theta)^2 + k^2}. \end{array} \tag{3.75b}
$$

The directional, spectral emissivity (unpolarized) follows as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} (\rho_{\parallel} + \rho_{\perp}), \end{array} \tag{3.76}
$$

and is shown (as reflectance) in Fig. 3- 9 for platinum at  $\lambda = 2\mu \mathrm{m}$ . The theoretical line for room temperature has been calculated with  $n = 5.29$ ,  $k = 6.71$  from [23]. Comparison with experimental emittances of Brandenberg [26], Brandenberg and Clausen [27], and Price [28] demonstrates the validity of Fresnel's relations.<sup>5</sup>

Equation (3.75) may be integrated analytically over all directions to obtain the spectral, hemispherical emissivity from equation (3.5). This was done by Dunkle [29] for the two different polarizations, resulting in

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\epsilon_{\parallel} = \frac{8n}{n^2 + k^2}\bigg[1 - \frac{n}{n^2 + k^2}\ln \big[n + 1\big)^2 +k^2\bigg] + \frac{(n^2 - k^2)}{k(n^2 + k^2)}\tan^{-1}\frac{k}{n + 1}\bigg),}\\ {\epsilon_{\perp} = 8n\bigg(1 - n\ln \frac{(n + 1)^2 + k^2}{n^2 + k^2} +\frac{(n^2 - k^2)}{k}\tan^{-1}\frac{k}{n(n + 1) + k^2}\bigg),}\\ {\epsilon_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2}\big(\epsilon_{\parallel} + \epsilon_{\perp}\big).} \end{array} \tag{3.77b}
$$

Figure 3- 10, from Dunkle [30], is a plot of the ratio of the hemispherical and normal emissivities,  $\epsilon_{\lambda} / \epsilon_{n\lambda}$ . For the case of  $k / n = 1$  the dashed line represents results from equation (3.77), while the solid lines were obtained by numerically integrating equations (3.52) through (3.55). For  $k / n > 1$  the two lines become indistinguishable. Hering and Smith [31] reported that equation (3.77) is accurate to within 1–2% for values of  $n^2 + k^2$  larger than 40 and 3.25, respectively. In view of the large values that  $n$  and, in particular,  $k$  assume for metals, equation (3.77) is virtually always accurate to better than 2% for metals in the visible and infrared wavelengths. For the reader's convenience the function emmet is included in Appendix F for the evaluation of equation (3.77).

Example 3.4. Determine the spectral, hemispherical emissivity for room- temperature nickel at a wavelength of  $\lambda = 10\mu \mathrm{m}$ , using (a) the Drude theory, and (b) the Hagen- Rubens relation.

# Solution

We first need to determine the optical constants  $n$  and  $k$  from either theory, then calculate the hemispherical emissivity from equation (3.77) or read it from Fig. 3- 10.

![](images/12fe198e8b42ae1a5fa39538b0712cf5b99e163981c17fa46e30e6dc99ef2969.jpg)  
FIGURE 3-10 Ratio of hemispherical and normal spectral emissivity for electrical conductors as a function of  $n$  and  $k$  [30].

(a) Using values for nickel from Table 3.3 in equation (3.64), we find with  $\nu = c_{0} / \lambda = 2.998 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s} / 10^{-5} \mathrm{~m} = 2.998 \times 10^{13} \mathrm{~Hz}$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\epsilon^{\prime} = 1.0 - 3.72\times 10^{30}\Big / \big[(2.998\times 10^{13})^{2} + (1.62\times 10^{13})^{2}\big] = 1 - 3204 = -3203,}\\ & {\epsilon^{\prime \prime} = 3204\times 1.62\times 10^{13}\big / 2.998\times 10^{13} = 1731,}\\ & {n^{2} = 0.5\times \big(-3208 + \sqrt{3208^{2} + 1731^{2}}\big) = 219,}\\ & {k^{2} = 0.5\times \big(3208 + \sqrt{3208^{2} + 1731^{2}}\big) = 3422,} \end{array}
$$

and

$$
n = 14.8,k = 58.5,k / n = 58.5 / 14.8 = 3.95.
$$

To use Fig. 3- 10 we first determine  $\rho_{n\lambda}$  as

$$
\rho_{n\lambda} = \frac{13.8^2 + 58.5^2}{15.8^2 + 58.5^2} = 0.984,
$$

and

$$
\epsilon_{n\lambda} = 1 - \rho_{n\lambda} = 0.016.
$$

From Fig. 3- 10  $\epsilon_{\lambda} / \epsilon_{n\lambda} \simeq 1.29$  and, therefore,  $\epsilon_{\lambda} \simeq 0.021$

(b) Using the Hagen-Rubens relation we find, from equation (3.72),

$$
\epsilon_{n\lambda} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{30\times 10^{-3}\times 1.28\times 10^{5}}} -\frac{1}{15\times 10^{-3}\times 1.28\times 10^{5}} = 0.032.
$$

Further, with  $n \simeq k \simeq \sqrt{30 \times 10^{- 3} \times 1.28 \times 10^{5}} = 62.0$ , we obtain from Fig. 3- 10  $\epsilon_{\lambda} / \epsilon_{n\lambda} \simeq 1.275$  and  $\epsilon_{\lambda} \simeq 0.041$

The answers from both models differ by a factor of  $\sim 2$ . This agrees with the trends shown in Fig. 3- 7.

Theoretical values for total, directional emissivities are obtained by (numerical) integration of equations (3.75) and (3.76) over the entire spectrum. The directional behavior of total emissivities is similar to that of spectral emissivities, as shown by the early measurements of Schmidt and Eckert [9], as depicted in Fig. 3- 1b in a polar diagram (as opposed to the Cartesian representation of Fig. 3- 9). The emittances were determined from total radiation measurements from samples heated to a few hundred degrees Celsius.

FIGURE 3-11 Total, hemispherical emittance of various polished metals as a function of temperature [18].

# Total, Hemispherical Emittance

Equation (3.77) may be integrated over the spectrum using equation (3.10), to obtain the total, hemispherical emittance of a metal. Several approximate relations, using the Hagen- Rubens limit, have been proposed, notably the ones by Davisson and Weeks [32] and by Schmidt and Eckert [9]. Expanding equation (3.77) into a series of powers of  $1 / n$  (with  $n = k \gg 1$ ), Parker and Abbott [18] were able to integrate equation (3.77) analytically, leading to

$$
\begin{array}{r}\epsilon (T) = 0.766(T / \sigma_{\mathrm{dc}})^{1 / 2} - [0.309 - 0.0889\ln (T / \sigma_{\mathrm{dc}})](T / \sigma_{\mathrm{dc}})\\ -0.0175(T / \sigma_{\mathrm{dc}})^{3 / 2},\quad T\mathrm{~in~K,~}\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}\mathrm{~in~}\Omega^{-1}\mathrm{cm}^{-1}. \end{array} \tag{3.78}
$$

As for the total, normal emittance the total, hemispherical emittance is seen to be approximately linearly proportional to temperature (since  $\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}} \propto 1 / T$ ) as long as the surface temperature is relatively low (so that only long wavelengths are of importance, for which the Hagen- Rubens relation gives reasonable results). Emittances calculated from equation (3.78) are compared with experimental data in Fig. 3- 11. Parker and Abbott also integrated the series expansion of equation (3.77) with  $n$  and  $k$  evaluated from the Drude theory. As for normal emissivities, the Drude model predicts values 30–70% lower than the Hagen- Rubens relations, contrary to experimental evidence shown in Fig. 3- 11. Again, the discrepancy was attributed to lattice imperfections and to the anomalous skin effect.

# Effects of Surface Temperature

The Hagen- Rubens relation, equation (3.72), predicts that the spectral, normal emittance of a metal should be proportional to  $1 / \sqrt{\sigma_{\mathrm{dc}}}$ . Since the electrical conductivity is approximately inversely proportional to temperature, the spectral emittance should, therefore, be proportional to the square root of absolute temperature for long enough wavelengths. This trend should also hold for the spectral, hemispherical emittance. Experiments have shown that this is indeed true for many metals. A typical example is given in Fig. 3- 12, showing the spectral dependence of the hemispherical emittance for tungsten for a number of temperatures [33]. Note that the emittance for tungsten tends to increase with temperature beyond a crossover wavelength of approximately  $1.3 \mu \mathrm{m}$ , while the temperature dependence is reversed for shorter wavelengths. Similar trends of a single crossover wavelength have been observed for many metals.

![](images/b767314025eda8b7c9d3a2f38ebfc44453c156f62cd268a498bad2412733830d.jpg)  
FIGURE 3-12 Temperature dependence of the spectral, hemispherical emittance of tungsten [33].

The total, normal or hemispherical emittances are calculated by integrating spectral values over all wavelengths, with the blackbody emissive power as weight function. Since the peak of the blackbody emissive power shifts toward shorter wavelengths with increasing temperature, we infer that hotter surfaces emit a higher fraction of energy at shorter wavelengths, where the spectral emittance is higher, resulting in an increase in total emittance as demonstrated in Figs. 3- 8 and 3- 11. Since the crossover wavelength is fairly short for many metals, the Hagen- Rubens temperature relation often holds for surprisingly high temperatures.

# 3.5 RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF NONCONDUCTORS

Electrical nonconductors have few free electrons and, thus, do not display the high reflectance and opaqueness behavior across the infrared as do metals. Semiconductors, as their title suggests, have some free electrons and are usually discussed together with nonconductors; however, they display some of the characteristics of a metal. The radiative properties of pure nonconductors are dominated in the infrared by photon- phonon interaction, i.e., by the photon excitation of the vibrational energy levels of the solid's crystal lattice. Outside the spectral region of strong absorption by vibrational transitions there is generally a region of fairly high transparency (and low reflectance), where absorption is dominated by impurities and imperfections in the crystal lattice. As such, these spectral regions often show irregular and erratic behavior.

# Wavelength Dependence of Spectral, Normal Properties

The spectral behavior of pure, crystalline nonconductors is often well described by the single oscillator Lorentz model of equation (3.63). One such material is the semiconductor  $\alpha$ - SiC (silicon carbide), a high- temperature ceramic of ever increasing importance. The spectral, normal reflectivity of pure, smooth  $\alpha$ - SiC at room temperature is shown in Fig. 3- 13, as given by Spitzer and coworkers [34]. The theoretical reflectivity in Fig. 3- 13 is evaluated from equations (3.63), (3.62) and (3.57) with  $\epsilon_0 = 6.7$ ,  $\nu_{pi} = 4.327\times 10^{13}\mathrm{Hz}$ ,  $\nu_{i} = 2.380\times 10^{13}\mathrm{Hz}$ ,  $\gamma_{i} = 1.428\times 10^{11}\mathrm{Hz}$ . Agreement between theory and experiment is superb for the entire range between  $2\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $22\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Inspection of equations (3.63) and (3.62) shows that outside the spectral range  $10\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < 13\mu \mathrm{m}$  (or  $2.5\times 10^{13}\mathrm{Hz} > \nu >1.9\times 10^{13}\mathrm{Hz}$ ),  $\alpha$ - SiC is essentially transparent

(absorptive index  $k \ll 1$ ) and weakly reflecting. Within the range of  $10\mu \mathrm{m} < \lambda < 13\mu \mathrm{m}$ $\alpha$ - SiC is not only highly reflecting but also opaque (i.e., any radiation not reflected is absorbed within a very thin surface layer, since  $k > 1$ ). The reflectivity drops off sharply on both sides of the absorption band. For this reason materials such as  $\alpha$ - SiC are sometimes used as bandpass filters: If electromagnetic radiation is reflected several times by an  $\alpha$ - SiC mirror, the emerging light will nearly exclusively lie in the spectral band  $10\mu \mathrm{m} < \lambda < 13\mu \mathrm{m}$ . This effect has led to the term Reststrahlen band (German for "remaining rays") for absorption bands due to crystal vibrational transitions. Bao and Ruan [35] have demonstrated that the dielectric function for semiconductors can be calculated through density functional theory, resulting in good agreement with experiment for GaAs.

Not all crystals are well described by the single oscillator model since two or more different vibrational transitions may be possible and can result in overlapping bands. Magnesium oxide  $(\mathrm{MgO})$  is an example of material that can be described by a two- oscillator model (two overlapping bands), as Jasperse and coworkers [36] have shown (Fig. 3- 14). The theoretical reflectivities are obtained with the parameters for the evaluation of equation (3.63) given in the figure. Note that for the calculation of  $\epsilon '$  and  $\epsilon ''$ , equation (3.63) needs to be summed over both

![](images/e1dffab376e027818e16b4a39b116660ba64bcf3c1ebc9a17ea3588b2a1674a6.jpg)  
FIGURE 3-15 Spectral, normal reflectance of silicon at room temperature [7].

bands,  $i = 1$  and 2. From a quantum viewpoint, the second, weaker oscillator is interpreted as the excitation of two phonons by a single photon [37].

Since the radiative properties outside a Reststrahlen band depend strongly on defects and impurities they may vary appreciably from specimen to specimen and even between different points on the same sample. For example, the spectral, normal reflectance of silicon at room temperature is shown in Fig. 3- 15 (redrawn from data collected by Touloukian and DeWitt [7]). Strong influence of different types and levels of impurities is clearly evident. Therefore, looking up properties for a given material in published tables is problematical unless a detailed description of surface and material preparation is given.

Equation (3.63) demonstrates that—outside a Reststrahlen band— $\epsilon^{\prime \prime}$  and, therefore, the absorptive index  $k$  of a nonconductor are very small; typically  $k< 10^{- 6}$  for a pure substance. While impurities and lattice defects can increase the value of  $k$ , it is very unlikely to find values of  $k > 10^{- 2}$  for a nonconductor outside Reststrahlen bands. At first glance it might appear, therefore, that all nonconductors must be highly transparent in the near infrared (and the visible). That this is not the case is readily seen from equation (1.55), which relates transmissivity to absorption coefficient. This, in turn, is related to the absorptive index through equation (2.42):

$$
\tau = e^{-\kappa s} = e^{-4\pi ks / \lambda_0}. \tag{3.79}
$$

For a  $1\mathrm{mm}$  thick layer of a material with  $k = 10^{- 3}$  at a wavelength (in vacuum) of  $\lambda_0 = 2\mu \mathrm{m}$ , equation (3.79) translates into a transmissivity of  $\tau = \exp (- 4\pi \times 10^{- 3}\times 1 / 2\times 10^{- 3}) = 0.002$ , i.e., the layer is essentially opaque. Still, the low values of  $k$  allow us to simplify Fresnel's relations considerably for the reflectivity of an interface. With  $k^2\ll (n - 1)^2$  the nonconductor essentially behaves like a perfect dielectric and, from equation (3.57), the spectral, normal reflectivity may be evaluated as

$$
\rho_{n\lambda} = \left(\frac{n - 1}{n + 1}\right)^2,k^2\ll n^2. \tag{3.80}
$$

Therefore, for optically smooth nonconductors the radiative properties may be calculated from refractive index data. Refractive indices for a number of semitransparent materials at room temperature are displayed in Fig. 3- 16 as a function of wavelength [20]. All these crystalline materials show similar spectral behavior: The refractive index drops rapidly in the visible

![](images/7bb04916c107f8769a549693e0012c034beba90d50c4ffe5ef9e89b1f6c928eb.jpg)  
FIGURE 3-16 Refractive indices for various semitransparent materials [20].

region, then is nearly constant (declining very gradually) until the midinfrared, where  $n$  again starts to drop rapidly. This behavior is explained by the fact that crystalline solids tend to have an absorption band, due to electronic transitions, near the visible, and a Reststrahlen band in the infrared: The first drop in  $n$  is due to the tail end of the electronic band, as illustrated in Fig. 2- 15b;6 the second drop in the midinfrared is due to the beginning of a Reststrahlen band. Listings of refractive indices for various glasses, water, inorganic liquids, and air are also available [23].

# Directional Dependence of Radiative Properties

For optically smooth nonconductors experiment has been found to follow Fresnel's relations of electromagnetic wave theory closely. Figure 3- 17 shows a comparison between theory and experiment for the directional reflectivity of glass (blackened on one side to avoid multiple reflections) for polarized, monochromatic irradiation [26]. Because  $k^2 \ll n^2$ , the absorptive index may be eliminated from equations (3.52) and (3.53), and the relations for a perfect dielectric become valid. Thus, for unpolarized light incident from vacuum (or a gas), from equations (3.59)

![](images/d8379c670110a371d875d0b88ba9aa57f699f1f9f2a5e676ab3039caf5d5b1f3.jpg)

and (3.60)

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime} = 1 - \frac{1}{2}\left(\rho_{\parallel} + \rho_{\perp}\right) = 1 - \frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{n^{2}\cos\theta - \sqrt{n^{2} - \sin^{2}\theta}}{n^{2}\cos\theta + \sqrt{n^{2} - \sin^{2}\theta}}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{\cos\theta - \sqrt{n^{2} - \sin^{2}\theta}}{\cos\theta + \sqrt{n^{2} - \sin^{2}\theta}}\right)^{2}\right]. \tag{3.81}
$$

Of course, the spectral, directional reflectivity for a dielectric can also be calculated from subroutine fresnel in Appendix F by setting  $k$  equal to zero. The directional variation of the spectral emissivity of dielectrics is shown in Fig. 3- 18. Comparison with Fig. 3- 1 demonstrates that experiment agrees well with electromagnetic wave theory for a large number of nonconductors, even for total (rather than spectral) directional emittances.

The spectral, hemispherical emissivity of a nonconductor may be obtained by integrating

equation (3.81) with equation (3.5). While tedious, such an integration is possible, as shown by Dunkle [30]:

$$
\begin{array}{l}\epsilon_{\parallel} = \frac{4(2n + 1)}{3(n + 1)^2},\\ \displaystyle \epsilon_{\perp} = \frac{4n^3(n^2 + 2n - 1)}{(n^2 + 1)(n^4 - 1)} +\frac{2n^2(n^2 - 1)^2}{(n^2 + 1)^3}\ln \left(\frac{n + 1}{n - 1}\right) - \frac{16n^4(n^4 + 1)\ln n}{(n^2 + 1)(n^4 - 1)^2},\\ \displaystyle \epsilon_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2} (\epsilon_{\parallel} + \epsilon_{\perp}). \end{array} \tag{3.82b}
$$

The variation of normal and hemispherical emissivities with refractive index may be calculated with functions emdiel  $(\epsilon_{\lambda})$  and emdielr  $(\epsilon_{\lambda} / \epsilon_{n\lambda})$  from Appendix F and is shown in Fig. 3- 19. While for metals the hemispherical emittance is generally larger than the normal emittance (cf. Fig. 3- 10), the opposite is true for nonconductors. The reason for this behavior is obvious from Fig. 3- 1: Metals have a relatively low emittance over most directions, but display a sharp increase for grazing angles before dropping back to zero. Nonconductors, on the other hand, have a (relatively high) emittance for most directions, which gradually drops to zero at grazing angles (without a peak).

Example 3.5. The directional reflectance of silicon carbide at  $\lambda = 2\mu \mathrm{m}$  and an incidence angle of  $\theta = 10^{\circ}$  has been measured as  $\rho_{n\lambda}^{\prime} = 0.20$  (cf. Fig. 3- 13). What is the hemispherical emittance of SiC at  $2\mu \mathrm{m}$ ?

# Solution

Since at  $\theta = 10^{\circ}$  the directional reflectance does not deviate substantially from the normal reflectance (cf. Fig. 3- 18), we have  $\epsilon_{n\lambda} = 1 - \rho_{n\lambda} \simeq 1 - 0.20 = 0.80$ . Then, from Fig. 3- 19,  $n \simeq 2.6$  and  $\epsilon_{\lambda} \simeq 0.76$ .

# Effects of Surface Temperature

The temperature dependence of the radiative properties of nonconductors is considerably more difficult to quantify than for metals. Infrared absorption bands in ionic solids due to excitation of lattice vibrations (Reststrahlen bands) generally increase in width and decrease in strength with temperature, and the wavelength of peak reflection/absorption shifts toward higher values. Figure 3- 20 shows the behavior of the  $\mathrm{MgO}$  Reststrahlen band [36]; similar results have been

obtained for SiC [38]. The reflectance for shorter wavelengths largely depends on the material's impurities. Often the behavior is similar to that of metals, i.e., the emittance increases with temperature for the near infrared, while it decreases with shorter wavelengths. As an example, Fig. 3- 21 shows the normal emittance for zirconium carbide [39]. On the other hand, the emittance of amorphous solids (i.e., solids without a crystal lattice) tends to be independent of temperature [40].

# 3.6 EFFECTS OF SURFACE ROUGHNESS

Up to this point, our discussion of radiative properties has assumed that the material surfaces are optically smooth, i.e., that the average length scale of surface roughness is much less than the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. Therefore, a surface that appears rough in visible light  $(\lambda \simeq 0.5\mu \mathrm{m})$  may well be optically smooth in the intermediate infrared  $(\lambda \simeq 50\mu \mathrm{m})$ . This difference is the primary reason why the electromagnetic wave theory ceases to be valid for very short wavelengths.

In this section we shall very briefly discuss some fundamental aspects of how surface roughness affects the radiative properties of opaque surfaces. Detailed discussions have been given in the books by Beckmann and Spizzichino [41] and Bass and Fuks [42], and in a review article by Ogilvy [43]

The character of roughness may be very different from surface to surface, depending on the material, method of manufacture, surface preparation, and so on, and classification of this character is difficult. A common measure of surface roughness is given by the root- mean- square roughness  $\sigma_{h}$ , defined as (cf. Fig. 3- 22)

$$
\sigma_{h} = \left[\left((z - z_{m})^{2}\right)\right]^{1 / 2} = \left[\frac{1}{A}\int_{A}(z - z_{m})^{2}dA\right]^{1 / 2}, \tag{3.83}
$$

where  $A$  is the surface to be examined, and  $|z - z_{m}|$  is the local height deviation from the mean. The root- mean- square roughness can be readily measured with a profilometer (a sharp

FIGURE 3-22Topography of a rough surface: (a) roughness with gradual slopes, (b) roughness with steep slopes. Both surfaces have similar root-mean-square roughness.

stylus that traverses the surface, recording the height fluctuations). Unfortunately,  $\sigma_h$  alone is woefully inadequate to describe the roughness of a surface as seen by comparing Fig. 3- 22a and  $b$ . Surfaces of identical  $\sigma_h$  may have vastly different frequencies of roughness peaks, resulting in different average slopes along the rough surface; in addition,  $\sigma_h$  gives no information on second order (or higher) roughness superimposed onto the fundamental roughness.

A first published attempt at modeling was made by Davies [44], who applied diffraction theory to a perfectly reflecting surface with roughness distributed according to a Gaussian probability distribution. The method neglects shading from adjacent peaks and, therefore, does poorly for grazing angles and for roughness with steep slopes (Fig. 3- 22b). Comparison with experiments of Bennett [45] shows that, for small incidence angles, Davies' model predicts the decay of specular peaks rather well (e.g., Fig. 3- 14 for  $\mathrm{MgO}$ ).

Davies' model predicts a sharp peak in the bidirectional reflection function,  $\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}$ , for the specular reflection direction, as has been found to be true experimentally for most cases as long

![](images/e2c53b1ff00914dcc7b1ac48e97a2ae467f70b82030dabf287607ff52690232a.jpg)  
FIGURE 3-23Normalized bidirectional reflection function (in plane of incidence) for magnesium oxide ceramic;  $\sigma_{h} = 1.9\mu \mathrm{m},\lambda = 0.5\mu \mathrm{m}$  [47].

as the incidence angle was not too large (e.g., Fig. 3- 5). For large off- normal angles of incidence, experiment has shown that the bidirectional reflectance function has its peak at polar angles greater than the specular direction. An example is given in Fig. 3- 23 for magnesium oxide with a roughness of  $\sigma_{h} = 1.9\mu \mathrm{m}$ , illuminated by radiation with a wavelength of  $\lambda = 0.5\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Shown is the bidirectional reflection function (normalized with its value in the specular direction) for the plane of incidence (the plane formed by the surface normal and the direction of the incoming radiation). We see that for small incidence angles  $(\theta_{i} = 10^{\circ})$  the reflection function is relatively diffuse, with a small peak in the specular direction. For comparison, diffuse reflection with a direction- independent reflection function is indicated by the dashed line. For larger incidence angles the reflection function displays stronger and stronger off- specular peaks. For example, for an incidence angle of  $\theta_{i} = 45^{\circ}$ , the off- specular peak lies in the region of  $\theta = 80^{\circ}$  to  $85^{\circ}$ . Apparently, these off- specular peaks are due to shadowing of parts of the surface by adjacent peaks. The effects of shadowing have been incorporated into the model by Beckmann [46] and Torrance and Sparrow [47]. With the appropriate choice for two unknown constants, Torrance and Sparrow found their model agreed very well with their experimental data (Fig. 3- 23).

The above models assumed that the surfaces have a certain root- mean- square roughness, but that they were otherwise random—no attempt was made to classify roughness slopes, secondary roughness, etc. Berry and coworkers [48,49] considered diffraction of radiation from fractal surfaces. The behavior of fractal surfaces is such that the enlarged images appear very similar to the original surface when the surface roughness is repeatedly magnified (Fig. 3- 22b). Majumdar and colleagues [50,51] carried out roughness measurements on a variety of surfaces and found that both processed and unprocessed surfaces are generally fractal. Majumdar and Tien [52] extended Davies' theory to include fractal surfaces, resulting in good agreement for experiments with different types of metallic surfaces [53,54]. However, since shadowing effects have not been considered, the model is again limited to near- normal incidence.

Buckius and coworkers [55- 58] have investigated various one- dimensionally rough surfaces (i.e., where surface height is a function of one coordinate only,  $z = z(x)$  in Fig. 3- 23), including the effects of roughness peak frequency (or slopes). For a randomly rough surface peak- to- peak spacing is usually characterized by a correlation length  $\sigma_{l}$  in a Gaussian correlation function  $C(L)$ , where  $L$  is the length over which the correlation diminishes by a factor of  $e$ , or

$$
C(L) = \frac{1}{\sigma_h^2}\left\langle \Bigl ((z(x) - z_m)\Bigl ((z(x + L) - z_m\Bigr)\Bigr) = e^{-(L / \sigma)}\right\rangle . \tag{3.84}
$$

FIGURE 3-24 Domains of validity for the geometric optics and the statistical rough surface reflection models, constructed for incidence angles between  $-45^{\circ}$  and  $+45^{\circ}$  from the surface normal.

They first considered triangular grooves with roughnesses  $\sigma_{h}, \sigma_{l}$  and wavelength  $\lambda$  all of the same order, finding the bidirectional reflectance by solving an integral form of Maxwell's equations. They found that these exact solutions predict the same scattering peaks as found from optical grating theory. They then applied their model to randomly rough surfaces described by equations (3.83) and (3.84), and compared their electromagnetic wave theory results with those from the simple Kirchhoff approximation [41]. In the Kirchhoff approximation a simplified set of electromagnetic wave equations is considered, assuming that at every point on the surface the electromagnetic field is equal to the field that would exist on a local tangent plane, and multiple reflections between local peaks are neglected. This approximation has been applied by a number of researchers to one- and two- dimensionally rough surfaces, and domains of validity have been constructed [56, 59- 61]. It is generally understood that the Kirchhoff approximation gives satisfactory results when surface geometric parameters  $(\sigma_{h}, \sigma_{l})$  are less than or comparable to the wavelength and the slope of the roughness is small  $(\sigma_{h} / \sigma_{l} \lesssim 0.3)$ . In more recent work Buckius and coworkers have concentrated on geometric optics (i.e., assuming Fresnel's relations to hold at every point on the surface), noting that Kirchhoff's approximation results in considerably larger numerical effort without significant improvement over the specular approximation. They considered one- and two- dimensionally uncoated rough surfaces [58, 62, 63], and surfaces coated with a thin film [64] (together with thin film theory). A map was constructed, shown in Fig. 3- 24, depicting under what conditions geometric optics gives satisfactory results as compared to exact electromagnetic wave theory calculations, using the criterion

$$
E_{d} = \left|\int_{-\pi /2}^{\pi /2}(I_{e} - I_{a})\cos \theta d\theta \right|\bigg / \int_{-\pi /2}^{\pi /2}I_{e}\cos \theta d\theta < 0.2, \tag{3.85}
$$

where  $I_{e}$  and  $I_{a}$  are exact and approximate reflected intensities, respectively. In general, geometric optics requires generation of statistical surfaces together with ray tracing, a relatively time- consuming task. Along the same line Zhang and coworkers investigated scattering from rough silicon surfaces and wafers [65- 67]. Surface topographic data obtained with an atomic force microscope showed the surface roughness to be significantly non- Gaussian and anisotropic. Nevertheless, the use of two- dimensional slope distributions and statistical ray tracing recovered experimental bidirectional reflection very accurately. Tang and Buckius [68] also introduced a statistical geometric optics model that does not require ray tracing. The resulting closed- form expressions were found to be satisfactory for  $\sigma_{h} / \sigma_{l} \lesssim 1$ , as also indicated in Fig. 3- 24. Comparison of geometric optics calculations with experiment (Al₂O₃ film on aluminum) showed good agreement, corroborating the applicability of their model [64]. Figure 3- 24 was further confirmed (and augmented somewhat) by Fu and Hsu [69], who compared statistical ray tracing results with numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations.

Carminati and colleagues [70] used Kirchhoff's approximation to provide an expression for the spectral, directional emittance (polarized or unpolarized) of a one- dimensionally randomly rough surface as

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\theta) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left[1 - \rho_{\lambda}(\theta -\tan^{-1}p)\right]\left|1 - p\tan \theta \right|P(p)dp, \tag{3.86}
$$

where  $\rho_{\lambda}(\theta)$  is the reflectivity as given by Fresnel's relations, equations (3.52) through (3.55), and  $P(p)$  is a slope probability derived from the correlation function as

$$
P(p) = \frac{\sigma_l}{\sigma_h\sqrt{4\pi}} e^{-(pq / 2\sigma_h)^2}. \tag{3.87}
$$

Calling this a "small slope emission model" (since, similar to the conclusions of Fig. 3- 24, its validity—in particular for parallel polarization—is limited to  $\sigma_h / \lambda \lesssim 0.3$ ), they extended this formula to a "large slope emission model," using Ishimaru and Chen's [71] shadowing function and assuming secondary reflection fields to be isotropic.

# 3.7 EFFECTS OF SURFACE DAMAGE AND OXIDE FILMS

Even optically smooth surfaces have a surface structure that is different from the bulk material, due to either surface damage or the presence of thin layers of foreign materials. Surface damage is usually caused by the machining process, particularly for metals and semiconductors, which distorts or damages the crystal lattice near the surface. Thin foreign coats may be formed by chemical reaction (mostly oxidation), adsorption (e.g., coats of grease or water), or electrostatics (e.g., dust particles). All of these effects may have a severe impact on the radiation properties of metals, and may cause considerable changes in the properties of semiconductors. Other materials are usually less affected, because metals have large absorptive indices,  $k$ , and thus high reflectances. A thin, nonmetallic layer with small  $k$  can significantly decrease the composite's reflectance (and raise its emittance). Dielectric materials, on the other hand, have small  $k$ 's and their relatively strong emission and absorption take place over a very thick surface layer. The addition of a thin, different dielectric layer cannot significantly alter their radiative properties.

A minimum amount of surface damage is introduced during sample preparation if  $(i)$  the technique of electropolishing is used [45],  $(ii)$  the surface is evaporated onto a substrate within an ultra- high vacuum environment [72], or  $(iii)$  the metal is evaporated onto a smooth sheet of transparent material and the reflectance is measured at the transparent medium- metal interface [73]. Figure 3- 25 shows the spectral, normal emittance of aluminum for a surface prepared by the ultra- high vacuum method [72], and for several other aluminum surface finishes [74]. While ultra- high vacuum aluminum follows the Drude theory for  $\lambda > 1\mu \mathrm{m}$  (cf. Fig. 3- 7), polished aluminum (clean and optically smooth for large wavelengths) has a much higher emittance over the entire spectrum. Still, the overall level of emittance remains very low, and the reflectance remains rather specular. Similar results have been obtained by Bennett [45], who compared electropolished and mechanically polished copper samples. As Fig. 3- 25 shows, the emittance is much larger still when off- the- shelf commercial aluminum is tested, probably due to a combination of roughness, contamination, and slight atmospheric oxidation. Bennett and colleagues [75] have shown that deposition of a thin oxide layer on aluminum (up to  $100\mathrm{\AA}$ ) appreciably increases the emittance only for wavelengths less than  $1.5\mu \mathrm{m}$ . This statement clearly is not true for thick oxide layers, as evidenced by Fig. 3- 25: Anodized aluminum (i.e., electrolytically oxidized material with a thick layer of alumina,  $\mathrm{Al}_2\mathrm{O}_3$ ) no longer displays the typical trends of a metal, but rather shows the behavior of the dielectric alumina. The effects of thin and thick oxide layers have been measured for many metals, with similar results. A good collection of such measurements has been given by Wood and coworkers [3]. As a rule of thumb, clean metal exposed to air at room temperature grows oxide films so thin that infrared

![](images/ca8fcdda9332bb0b4772d751db7931821f2cd6d85c666ae359010505d9f845bf.jpg)  
FIGURE 3-25Spectral, normal emittance for aluminum with different surface finishes [72, 74].  FIGURE 3-26Effects of ultraviolet and gamma ray irradiation on a titanium dioxide/epoxy coating [78].

emittances are not affected appreciably. On the other hand, metal surfaces exposed to hightemperature oxidizing environments (furnaces, etc.) generally have radiative properties similar to those of their oxide layer.

While most severe for metallic surfaces the problem of surface modification is not unknown for nonmetals. For example, it is well known that silicon carbide (SiC), when exposed to air at high temperature, forms a silica  $(\mathrm{SiO}_2)$  layer on its surface, resulting in a reflection band around  $9\mu \mathrm{m}$  [76]. Nonoxidizing chemical reactions can also significantly change the radiative properties of dielectrics. For example, the strong ultraviolet radiation in outer space (from the sun) as well as gamma rays (from inside the Earth's van Allen belt) can damage the surface of spacecraft protective coatings like white acrylic paint [77] or titanium dioxide/epoxy coating [78], as shown in Fig. 3- 26.

In summary, radiative properties for opaque surfaces, when obtained from figures in this chapter, from the tables given in Appendix B, or from other tabulations and figures of [1- 8,79,80], should be taken with a grain of salt. Unless detailed descriptions of surface purity, preparation, treatment, etc., are available, the data may not give any more than an order- of- magnitude estimate. One should also keep in mind that the properties of a surface may change during a process or overnight (by oxidation and/or contamination).

FIGURE 3-27 Reflectivity and transmissivity of a thick semitransparent sheet.

# 3.8 RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF SEMITRANSPARENT SHEETS

The properties of radiatively participating media will be discussed in Chapters 11 through 13; i.e., semitransparent media that absorb and emit in depth and whose temperature distribution is, thus, strongly affected by thermal radiation. There are, however, important applications where thermal radiation enters an enclosure through semitransparent sheets, and where the temperature distribution within the sheet is unimportant or not significantly affected by thermal radiation. Applications include solar collector cover plates, windows in connection with light level calculations within interior spaces, and so forth. We shall, therefore, briefly present here the radiative properties of window glass, for single and multiple pane windows with and without surface coatings. Glass and other amorphous solids tend to have extremely smooth surfaces, allowing for accurate predictions of interface reflectivities from electromagnetic wave theory.

# Properties of Single Pane Glasses

For an optically smooth window pane of a thickness  $d$  substantially larger than the wavelength of incident light,  $d \gg \lambda$ , the radiative properties are readily determined through geometric optics and ray tracing. Consider the sheet of semitransparent material depicted in Fig. 3- 27. The sheet has a complex index of refraction  $m_2 = n_2 - ik_2$  with  $k_2 \ll 1$ , so that the transmission through the sheet (not counting surface reflections),

$$
\tau = e^{-\kappa_2d / \cos \theta_2} = e^{-4\pi k_2d / \lambda_0\cos \theta_2}, \tag{3.88}
$$

is appreciable [cf. equation (2.42)]. Here  $\kappa_2 = 4\pi k_2 / \lambda_0$  is the absorption coefficient,  $\lambda_0$  is the wavelength of the incident light in vacuum, and  $d / \cos \theta_2$  is the distance a light beam of oblique incidence travels through Medium 2 in a single pass. The semitransparent sheet is surrounded by two dielectric materials with refractive indices  $n_1$  and  $n_3$ . To calculate the reflectivity at the interfaces 1- 2 and 2- 3 it is sufficient to use Fresnel's relations for dielectric media, since  $k_2 \ll 1$ . Interchanging  $n_1$  and  $n_2$ , as well as  $\theta_1$  and  $\theta_2$ , in equation (2.96) shows that the reflectivity at the 1- 2 interface is the same, regardless of whether radiation is incident from Medium 1 or Medium 2, i.e.,  $\rho_{12} = \rho_{21}$  and  $\rho_{23} = \rho_{32}$ . Now consider radiation of unit strength to be incident upon the sheet from Medium 1 in the direction of  $\theta_1$ . As indicated in Fig. 3- 27 the fraction  $\rho_{12}$  is reflected at the first interface, while the fraction  $(1 - \rho_{12})$  is refracted into Medium 2, according to Snell's law. After traveling a distance  $d / \cos \theta_2$  through Medium 2 the attenuated fraction

$(1 - \rho_{12})\tau$  arrives at the 2- 3 interface. Here the amount  $(1 - \rho_{12})\tau \rho_{23}$  is reflected back to the 1- 2 interface, while the fraction  $(1 - \rho_{12})\tau (1 - \rho_{23})$  leaves the sheet and penetrates into Medium 3 in a direction of  $\theta_{3}$ . The internally reflected fraction keeps bouncing back and forth between the interfaces, as indicated in the figure, until all energy is depleted by reflection back into Medium 1, by absorption within Medium 2, and by transmission into Medium 3. Therefore, the slab reflectivity,  $R_{\mathrm{slab}}$ , may be calculated by summing over all contributions, or

$$
R_{\mathrm{slab}} = \rho_{12} + \rho_{23}(1 - \rho_{12})^{2}\tau^{2}\Big[1 + \rho_{12}\rho_{23}\tau^{2} + (\rho_{12}\rho_{23}\tau^{2})^{2} + \dots \Big].
$$

Since  $\rho_{12}\rho_{23}\tau^{2}< 1$  the series is readily evaluated [81], and

$$
R_{\mathrm{slab}} = \rho_{12} + \frac{\rho_{23}(1 - \rho_{12})^2\tau^2}{1 - \rho_{12}\rho_{23}\tau^2} = \frac{\rho_{12} + (1 - 2\rho_{12})\rho_{23}\tau^2}{1 - \rho_{12}\rho_{23}\tau^2}. \tag{3.89}
$$

Similarly, the slab transmissivity,  $T_{\mathrm{slab}}$ , follows as

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {T_{\mathrm{slab}} = (1 - \rho_{12})(1 - \rho_{23})\tau \left[1 + \rho_{12}\rho_{23}\tau^2 +(\rho_{12}\rho_{23}\tau^2)^2 +\dots \right]}\\ & {\qquad = \frac{(1 - \rho_{12})(1 - \rho_{23})\tau}{1 - \rho_{12}\rho_{23}\tau^2}.} \end{array} \tag{3.90}
$$

These relations are the same as the ones evaluated for thick sheets by the electromagnetic wave theory, equations (2.129) and (2.130). From conservation of energy  $A_{\mathrm{slab}} + R_{\mathrm{slab}} + T_{\mathrm{slab}} = 1$ , and the slab absorptivity follows as

$$
A_{\mathrm{slab}} = \frac{(1 - \rho_{12})(1 + \rho_{23}\tau)(1 - \tau)}{1 - \rho_{12}\rho_{23}\tau^2}. \tag{3.91}
$$

If Media 1 and 3 are identical (say, air), then  $\rho_{12} = \rho_{23} = \rho$  and equations (3.89) through (3.91) reduce to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_{\mathrm{slab}} = \rho \left[1 + \frac{(1 - \rho)^2\tau^2}{1 - \rho^2\tau^2}\right],}\\ {T_{\mathrm{slab}} = \frac{(1 - \rho)^2\tau}{1 - \rho^2\tau^2},}\\ {A_{\mathrm{slab}} = \frac{(1 - \rho)(1 - \tau)}{1 - \rho\tau}.} \end{array} \tag{3.92}
$$

Figure 3- 28 shows typical slab transmissivities and reflectivities of several different types of glasses for normal incidence and for a pane thickness of  $12.7\mathrm{mm}$ . Most glasses have fairly constant and low slab reflectivity in the spectral range from  $0.1\mu \mathrm{m}$  up to about  $9\mu \mathrm{m}$  (relatively constant refractive index  $n$ , small absorptive index  $k$ ). Beyond  $9\mu \mathrm{m}$  the reflectivity increases because of two Reststrahlen bands [82] (not shown). Glass transmissivity tends to be very high between  $0.4\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $2.5\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Beyond  $2.5\mu \mathrm{m}$  the transmissivity of window glass diminishes rapidly, making windows opaque to infrared radiation. This gives rise to the so- called "greenhouse" effect: Since the sun behaves much like a blackbody at  $5777\mathrm{K}$ , most of its energy ( $\approx 95\%$ ) falling onto Earth lies in the spectral range of high glass transmissivities. Therefore, solar energy falling onto a window passes readily into the space behind it. The spectral variation of solar irradiation, for extraterrestrial and unity air mass conditions, was given in Fig. 1- 3. On the other hand, if the space behind the window is at low to moderate temperatures (300 to  $400\mathrm{K}$ ), emission from such surfaces is at fairly long wavelengths, which is absorbed by the glass and, thus, cannot escape.

FIGURE 3-29 Spectral, normal slab transmissivity and reflectivity of soda-lime glass at room temperature, for a number of pane thicknesses; data from [7].

The influence of pane thickness on reflectivity and transmissivity is shown in Fig. 3- 29 for the case of soda- lime glass (i.e., ordinary window glass). As the pane thickness increases, transmissivity decreases due to the increasing absorption. Since the absorption coefficient is small for  $\lambda < 2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  (see Fig. 1- 17), the effect is rather minor (and even less so for the other glasses shown in Fig. 3- 28).

In some high- temperature applications the emission from hot glass surfaces becomes important (e.g., in the manufacture of glass). Gardon [83] has calculated the spectral, hemispherical and total, hemispherical emissivity of soda- lime glass sheets at  $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  based on the data of Neuroth [84]. Spectral emissivities beyond  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  do not depend strongly on temperature since the absorption coefficient is relatively temperature- independent (see Fig. 1- 17). For all but the thinnest glass sheets the material becomes totally opaque, and the hemispherical emissivity is

evaluated as  $\epsilon_{\lambda} = 1 - \rho_{\lambda} \simeq 0.91.7$

# Coatings

Glass sheets and other transparent solids often have coatings on them for a variety of reasons: to eliminate transmission of ultraviolet radiation, to decrease or increase transmission over certain spectral regions, and the like. We distinguish between thick coatings  $(d \gg \lambda$ , no interference effects) and thin film coatings  $(d = \mathcal{O}(\lambda)$ , with wave interference, as discussed in Chapter 2). The effects of a thick dielectric layer (with refractive index  $n_2$ , and absorptive index  $k_2 \simeq 0$ ) on the reflectivity of a thick sheet of glass  $(n_3$  and  $k_3 \simeq 0$ ) is readily analyzed with the two- interface formula given by equation (3.89). With  $\tau \simeq 1$  and, for normal incidence,

$$
\rho_{12} = \left(\frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2}\right)^2\quad \mathrm{and}\quad \rho_{23} = \left(\frac{n_2 - n_3}{n_2 + n_3}\right)^2,
$$

the coating reflectivity becomes

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_{\mathrm{coat}} = \frac{\rho_{12} + \rho_{23} - 2\rho_{12}\rho_{23}}{1 - \rho_{12}\rho_{23}} = 1 - \frac{(1 - \rho_{12})(1 - \rho_{23})}{1 - \rho_{12}\rho_{23}}}\\ {= 1 - \frac{(4n_1n_2)(4n_2n_3)}{(n_1 + n_2)^2(n_2 + n_3)^2 - (n_1 - n_2)^2(n_2 - n_3)^2},} \end{array}
$$

which is readily simplified to

$$
R_{\mathrm{coat}} = 1 - \frac{4n_1n_2n_3}{(n_2^2 + n_1n_3)(n_1 + n_3)}. \tag{3.95}
$$

If the aim is to minimize the overall reflectivity of the semitransparent sheet, then a value for the refractive index of the coating must be chosen to make  $R_{\mathrm{coat}}$  a minimum. Thus, setting  $dR_{\mathrm{coat}} / dn_2 = 0$  leads to

$$
n_{2,\min} = \sqrt{n_1n_3}. \tag{3.96}
$$

Substituting equation (3.96) into (3.95) results in a minimum coated- surface reflectivity of

$$
R_{\mathrm{coat,min}} = 1 - \frac{2\sqrt{n_1n_3}}{n_1 + n_3}. \tag{3.97}
$$

The slab reflectivity for a thin dielectric coating on a dielectric substrate,  $d = \mathcal{O}(\lambda)$ , is subject to wave interference effects and has been evaluated in Chapter 2, from equation (2.124), with  $\delta_{12} = \pi$  and  $\delta_{23} = 0$  (cf. Example 2.6), as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_{\mathrm{coat}} = \frac{r_{12}^2 + 2r_{12}r_{23}\cos\zeta + r_{23}^2}{1 + 2r_{12}r_{23}\cos\zeta + r_{12}^2r_{23}^2},}\\ {r_{12} = \frac{n_1 - n_2}{n_1 + n_2},\quad r_{23} = \frac{n_2 - n_3}{n_2 + n_3},\quad \zeta = \frac{4\pi n_2d}{\lambda}.} \end{array} \tag{3.98b}
$$

Equation (3.98) has an interference minimum when  $\zeta = \pi$  (i.e., if the film thickness is a quarter of the wavelength inside the film,  $d = 0.25\lambda /n_2$ ). For this interference minimum the reflectivity of the coated surface becomes

$$
R_{\mathrm{coat}} = \left(\frac{r_{12} - r_{23}}{1 - r_{12}r_{23}}\right)^2. \tag{3.99}
$$

FIGURE 3-30Spectral, normal reflectivity and transmissivity of a  $0.35\mu \mathrm{m}$  thick Sn-doped  $\mathrm{In}_2\mathrm{O}_3$  film deposited on Corning 7059 glass [86].

Clearly, this equation results in a minimum (or zero) reflectivity if  $r_{12} = r_{23}$ , or  $n_{2,\min} = \sqrt{n_1n_3}$ , which is the same as for thick films, equation (3.96). To obtain minimum reflectivities for glass  $(n_{3}\simeq 1.5)$  facing air  $(n_{1}\simeq 1)$  would require a dielectric film with  $n_{2}\simeq 1.22$ . Dielectric films of such low refractive index do not appear possible. However, Yoldas and Partlow [85] showed that a porous film (pore size  $\ll \lambda$ ) can effectively lower the refractive index, and they obtained glass transmissivities greater than  $99\%$  throughout the visible.

In other applications a strong reflectivity is desired. An example of experimentally determined reflectivity and transmissivity of a coated dielectric is given in Fig. 3- 30 for a  $0.35\mu \mathrm{m}$  thick layer of Sn- doped  $\mathrm{In}_2\mathrm{O}_3$  film on glass [86]. The oscillating properties clearly demonstrate the effects of wave interference at shorter wavelengths. At wavelengths  $\lambda >1.5\mu \mathrm{m}$  the material has a strong absorption band, making it highly reflective and opaque. Thus, this coated glass makes a better solar collector cover plate than ordinary glass, since internally emitted infrared radiation is reflected back into the collector (rather than being absorbed), keeping the cover glass cool and reducing losses. Similar behavior was obtained by Yoldas and O'Keefe [87], who deposited thin (20 to  $50\mathrm{nm}$ ) triple- layer films (titanium dioxide- silver- titanium dioxide) on soda- lime glass. It is also possible to tailor the directional reflection behavior using special, obliquely deposited films [88].

# Multiple Parallel Sheets

To minimize convection losses, two or more parallel sheets of windows are often employed, as illustrated in Fig. 3- 31a. To find the total reflectivity and transmissivity of  $n$  layers, we break the system up into a single layer and the remaining  $(n - 1)$  layers. Then ray tracing (see Fig. 3- 31b) results in

$$
R_{n} = R_{1} + T_{1}^{2}R_{n - 1}\left[1 + R_{1}R_{n - 1} + (R_{1}R_{n - 1})^{2} + \dots \right] = R_{1} + \frac{T_{1}^{2}R_{n - 1}}{1 - R_{1}R_{n - 1}}, \tag{3.100}
$$

and, similarly,

$$
T_{n} = \frac{T_{1}T_{n - 1}}{1 - R_{1}R_{n - 1}}, \tag{3.101}
$$

where  $R_{n - 1}$  and  $T_{n - 1}$  are the net reflectivity and transmissivity of  $(n - 1)$  layers. The net absorptivity of the  $n$  layers can be calculated directly either from

$$
\begin{array}{l}{A_n = A_1 + A_1T_1R_{n - 1}(1 + R_1R_{n - 1} + \dots) + A_{n - 1}T_1(1 + R_1R_{n - 1} + \dots)}\\ {= A_1 + \frac{T_1(A_1R_{n - 1} + A_{n - 1})}{1 - R_1R_{n - 1}},} \end{array} \tag{3.102}
$$

or from conservation of energy, i.e.,  $A_{n} + R_{n} + T_{n} = 1$ . In the development of equation (3.100) we have assumed that  $R_{1}$  is the same for light shining onto the top or the bottom of the sheet  $(\rho_{12} = \rho_{23})$ , in other words, that equation (3.92) is valid. The above recursion formulae were first derived by Edwards [89] without the restriction of  $\rho_{12} = \rho_{23}$ . In a later paper Edwards [90] expanded the method to include wave interference effects for stacked thin films. Multiple sheets subject to mixed diffuse and collimated irradiation, but without interference effects, were analyzed by Mitts and Smith [91].

Example 3.6. Determine the normal transmissivity of a triple- glazed window for visible wavelengths. The window panes are thin sheets of soda- lime glass, separated by layers of air.

# Solution

The reflectivity  $R_{1}$  and transmissivity  $T_{1}$  of a single sheet are readily calculated from equations (3.92) and (3.93). For thin sheets (e.g., curve 1 in Fig. 3- 29) we have  $\tau \simeq 1$ , and with  $n \simeq 1.5$  (cf. Fig. 3- 16),  $\rho = [(1.5 - 1) / (1.5 + 1)]^2 = 0.04$ . Therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_1 = \rho \left[1 + \frac{(1 - \rho)^2}{1 - \rho^2}\right] = \frac{2\rho}{1 + \rho} = \frac{2\times 0.04}{1 + 0.04} = 0.0769,}\\ {T_1 = \frac{(1 - \rho)^2}{1 - \rho^2} = \frac{1 - \rho}{1 + \rho} = 1 - R_1 = 0.9231} \end{array}
$$

(and  $A_{1} = 0$ , since we assumed  $\tau \simeq 1$ ). For two panes, from equations (3.100) and (3.101) with  $n = 2$

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_2 = R_1 + \frac{T_1^2R_1}{1 - R_1^2} = 0.0769\left(1 + \frac{0.9231^2}{1 - 0.0769^2}\right) = 0.1429,}\\ {T_2 = \frac{T_1^2}{1 - R_1^2} = 0.8571} \end{array}
$$

(and, again  $A_{2} = 0$ ). Finally, for three panes

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_3 = R_1 + \frac{T_1^2R_2}{1 - R_1R_2} = 0.0769 + \frac{0.9231^2\times 0.1429}{1 - 0.0769\times 0.1429} = 0.2000,}\\ {T_3 = \frac{T_1T_2}{1 - R_1R_2} = \frac{0.9231\times 0.8571}{1 - 0.0769\times 0.1429} = 0.8000.} \end{array}
$$

Assuming negligible absorption within the glass,  $80\%$  of visible radiation is transmitted through the triple- pane window (at normal incidence), while  $20\%$  is reflected back.

Although they are valid, equations (3.89) and (3.90) are quite cumbersome for oblique incidence, in particular, if absorption cannot be neglected. Some calculations for nonabsorbing

(for  $n = 1.5$  [92] and for  $n = 1.526$  [93]) and absorbing [93]  $(n = 1.526)$  multiple sheets of window glass have been carried out. Note that, for oblique incidence, the overall reflectivity and transmissivity are different for parallel- and perpendicular- polarized light. Even for unpolarized light the polarized components must be determined before averaging, as

$$
R_{n} = \frac{1}{2} (R_{n\perp} + R_{n\parallel}),\quad T_{n} = \frac{1}{2} (T_{n\perp} + T_{n\parallel}). \tag{3.103}
$$

The results of the calculations by Duffie and Beckman [93] are given in graphical form in Fig. 3- 32.

# 3.9 SPECIAL SURFACES

For many engineering applications it would be desirable to have a surface material available with very specific radiative property characteristics. For example, the net radiative heat gain of a solar collector is the difference between absorbed solar energy and radiation losses due to emission by the collector surface. While a black absorber plate would absorb all solar irradiation, it unfortunately would also lose a maximum amount of energy due to surface emission. An ideal solar collector surface has a maximum emittance for those wavelengths and directions over which solar energy falls onto the surface, and a minimum emittance for all other wavelengths and directions. On the other hand, a radiative heat rejector, such as the ones used by the U.S. Space Shuttle to reject excess heat into outer space, should have a high emittance at longer wavelengths, and a high reflectance for those wavelengths and directions with which sunshine falls onto the heat rejector.

To a certain degree the radiative properties of a surface can be tailored toward desired characteristics. Surfaces that absorb and emit strongly over one wavelength range, and reflect strongly over the rest of the spectrum are called spectrally selective, while surfaces with tailored directional properties are known as directionally selective.

Solar collector  
FIGURE 3-34 Solar irradiation on and emission from a solar collector plate.

An ideal, spectrally selective surface would be black  $(\alpha_{\lambda} = \epsilon_{\lambda} = 1)$  over the wavelength range over which maximum absorption (or emission) is desired, and would be totally reflective  $(\alpha_{\lambda} = \epsilon_{\lambda} = 0)$  beyond a certain cutoff wavelength  $\lambda_{c}$ , where undesirable emission (or absorption) would occur. Of course, in practice such behavior can only be approximated. Such an ideal surface is indicated by the long- dash line in Fig. 3- 33.

The performance of a selective surface is usually measured by the  $\alpha /\epsilon$ - ratio," where  $\alpha$  is the total, directional absorptance of the material for solar irradiation, while  $\epsilon$  is the total, hemispherical emittance for infrared surface emission. Consider a solar collector plate (Fig. 3- 34), irradiated by the sun at an off- normal angle of  $\theta_{s}$ . Making an energy balance (per unit area of the collector), we find

$$
q_{\mathrm{net}} = \epsilon \sigma T_{\mathrm{coll}}^4 -\alpha q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \theta_s, \tag{3.104}
$$

where the factor  $\cos \theta_{s}$  appears since  $q_{\mathrm{sun}}$  is solar heat flux per unit area normal to the sun's rays. The total, hemispherical emittance may be related to spectral, hemispherical values through equation (3.10), while the total, directional absorptance is found from equation (3.23). Thus

$$
\begin{array}{l}\epsilon = \frac{1}{\sigma T_{\mathrm{coll}}^4}\int_0^\infty \epsilon_\lambda (T_{\mathrm{coll}},\lambda)E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{coll}},\lambda)d\lambda ,\\ \displaystyle \alpha = \frac{1}{q_{\mathrm{sun}}}\int_0^\infty \alpha_\lambda (T_{\mathrm{coll}},\lambda,\theta_s)q_{\mathrm{sun},\lambda}d\lambda = \frac{1}{\sigma T_{\mathrm{sun}}^4}\int_0^\infty \alpha_\lambda (T_{\mathrm{coll}},\lambda,\theta_s)E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{sun}},\lambda)d\lambda , \end{array} \tag{3.105b}
$$

where we have made use of the fact that the spectral distribution of  $q_{\mathrm{sun}}$  is the same as the blackbody emission from the sun's surface. Clearly, for optimum performance of a collector the solar absorptance should be maximum, while the infrared emittance should be minimum. Therefore, a large  $\alpha /\epsilon$ - ratio indicates a better performance for a solar collector. On the other hand, for radiative heat rejectors a minimum value for  $\alpha /\epsilon$  is desirable.

Most selective absorbers are manufactured by coating a thin nonmetallic film onto a metal. Over most wavelengths the nonmetallic film is very transmissive and incoming radiation passes straight through to the metal interface with its very high reflectance. However, many nonconductors have spectral regions over which they do absorb appreciably without being strongly reflective (usually due to lattice defects or contaminants). The result is a material that acts like a strongly reflecting metal over most of the spectrum, but like a strongly absorbing nonconductor for selected wavelength ranges. A few examples of such selective surfaces are also given in Fig. 3- 33. Black chrome (chrome- oxide coating) and black nickel (nickel- oxide coating) are popular solar collector materials, while epoxy paint may be used as an efficient solar energy rejector. If the coatings are extremely thin, interference effects can also be exploited to improve selectivity. For example, Martin and Bell [94] showed that a three- layer coating of  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$ - Al-  $\mathrm{SiO}_2$  on metallic substrates has a solar absorptance greater than  $90\%$ , but an infrared emittance of  $< 10\%$ . Fan and Bachner [86] produced a coating for glass that raised its reflectance to  $>80\%$  for infrared wavelengths, without appreciably affecting solar transmittance (Fig. 3- 30).

The advantages of spectrally selective surface properties were first recognized by Hottel and Woertz [95]. With the growing interest in solar energy collection during the 1950s and 1960s, a number of selective coatings were developed, and the subject was discussed by Gier and Dunkle [96], and Tabor and coworkers [97,98]. There are several compilations for radiative properties of selective absorbers [3,8,99]. A somewhat more detailed discussion about spectrally selective surface properties has been given by Duffie and Beckman [93].

Example 3.7. Let us assume that it is possible to manufacture a diffusely absorbing/emitting selective absorber with a spectral emittance  $\epsilon_{\lambda} = \epsilon_{s} = 0.05$  for  $0< \lambda < \lambda_{c}$  and  $\epsilon_{\lambda} = \epsilon_{c} = 0.95$  for  $\lambda >\lambda_{c}$ , where the cutoff wavelength can be varied through manufacturing methods. Determine the optimum cutoff wavelength for a solar collector with an absorber plate at  $350\mathrm{K}$  that is exposed to solar irradiation of  $q_{\mathrm{sun}} = 1000\mathrm{W / m}^2$  at an angle of  $\theta_{s} = 30^{\circ}$  off- normal. What is the net radiative energy gain for such a collector?

# Solution

A simple energy balance on the surface, using equations (3.9) and (3.41) leads to

$$
q_{\mathrm{net}} = E - H_{\mathrm{abs}}'(\theta_s) = \epsilon E_b - \alpha '(\theta_s)H'(\theta_s)
$$

where  $q_{\mathrm{net}} > 0$  if a net amount of energy leaves the surface, and  $q_{\mathrm{net}}< 0$  if energy is collected. Total, hemispherical emittance follows from equation (3.10) while total, directional absorptance is determined from equation (3.23). For our diffuse absorber we have  $\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\lambda ,\theta) = \epsilon_{\lambda}(\lambda)$  and

$$
\begin{array}{l}\epsilon = \frac{1}{\sigma T_{\mathrm{coll}}^4}\bigg[\epsilon_s\int_0^{\lambda_c}E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{coll}},\lambda)d\lambda +\epsilon_c\int_{\lambda_c}^{\infty}E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{coll}},\lambda)d\lambda \bigg] = \epsilon_s + \frac{(\epsilon_c - \epsilon_s)}{\sigma T_{\mathrm{coll}}^4}\int_{\lambda_c}^{\infty}E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{coll}},\lambda)d\lambda ,\\ \displaystyle \alpha = \frac{1}{\sigma T_{\mathrm{sun}}^4}\bigg[\epsilon_s\int_0^{\lambda_c}E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{sun}},\lambda)d\lambda +\epsilon_c\int_{\lambda_c}^{\infty}E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{sun}},\lambda)d\lambda \bigg] = \epsilon_s + \frac{(\epsilon_c - \epsilon_s)}{\sigma T_{\mathrm{sun}}^4}\int_{\lambda_c}^{\infty}E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{sun}},\lambda)d\lambda . \end{array}
$$

Substituting these expressions into our energy balance leads to

$$
q_{\mathrm{net}} = \epsilon_s(\sigma T_{\mathrm{coll}}^4 -q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \theta_s) + (\epsilon_c - \epsilon_s)\int_{\lambda_c}^{\infty}\left[E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{coll}},\lambda) - \frac{q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos\theta_s}{\sigma T_{\mathrm{sun}}^4} E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{sun}},\lambda)\right]d\lambda .
$$

Optimizing the value of  $\lambda_{c}$  implies finding a maximum for  $q_{\mathrm{net}}$ . Therefore, from Leibniz's rule (see, e.g., [81]), which states that

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\int_{a(x)}^{b(x)}f(x,y)dy = \frac{db}{dx} f(x,b) - \frac{da}{dx} f(x,a) + \int_a^b\frac{df}{dx} (x,y)dy, \tag{3.106}
$$

we find

$$
\frac{dq_{\mathrm{net}}}{d\lambda_c} = -(\epsilon_c - \epsilon_s)\bigg[E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{coll}},\lambda_c) - \frac{q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos\theta_s}{\sigma T_{\mathrm{sun}}^4} E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{sun}},\lambda_c)\bigg] = 0,
$$

or

$$
E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{coll}},\lambda_c) = \frac{q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos\theta_s}{\sigma T_{\mathrm{sun}}^4} E_{b\lambda}(T_{\mathrm{sun}},\lambda_c).
$$

Note that the cutoff wavelength does not depend on the values for  $\epsilon_{c}$  and  $\epsilon_{s}$ . Using Planck's law, equation (1.13), with  $n = 1$  (surroundings are air), the last expression reduces to

$$
\exp (C_2 / \lambda_cT_{\mathrm{coll}}) - 1 = \frac{\sigma T_{\mathrm{sun}}^4}{q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos\theta_s}\left[\exp (C_2 / \lambda_cT_{\mathrm{sun}}) - 1\right].
$$

This transcendental equation needs to be solved by iteration. As a first guess one may employ Wien's distribution, equation (1.18) (dropping two  $- 1^{\prime}$  terms),

$$
\exp (C_2 / \lambda_cT_{\mathrm{coll}})\simeq \frac{\sigma T_{\mathrm{sun}}^4}{q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos\theta_s}\exp (C_2 / \lambda_cT_{\mathrm{sun}})
$$

or

$$
\exp \left[\frac{C_2}{\lambda_c}\left(\frac{1}{T_{\mathrm{coll}}} -\frac{1}{T_{\mathrm{sun}}}\right)\right]\simeq \frac{\sigma T_{\mathrm{sun}}^4}{q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos\theta_s},
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}\lambda_{c}\simeq C_{2}\left(\frac{1}{T_{\mathrm{coll}}} -\frac{1}{T_{\mathrm{sun}}}\right) / \ln \frac{\sigma T_{\mathrm{sun}}^{4}}{q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos\theta_{s}}\\ = 14,388\left(\frac{1}{350} -\frac{1}{5777}\right)\mu \mathrm{m} / \ln \frac{5.670\times 10^{-8}\times 5777}{1000\times\cos 30^{\circ}} = 3.45\mu \mathrm{m}. \end{array}
$$

Iterating the full Planck's law leads to a cutoff wavelength of  $\lambda_{c} = 3.69\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Substituting these values into the expressions for emittance and absorptance,

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\epsilon = \epsilon_s + (\epsilon_c - \epsilon_s)[1 - f(\lambda_cT_{\mathrm{coll}})] = 0.95 - 0.90 + 0.90f(3.69\times 350)}\\ & {\quad = 0.05 + 0.90\times 0.00413 = 0.054,}\\ & {\alpha = \epsilon_s + (\epsilon_c - \epsilon_s)[1 - f(\lambda_cT_{\mathrm{sun}})] = 0.05 + 0.90\times f(3.69\times 5777)}\\ & {\quad = 0.05 + 0.90\times 0.98785 = 0.939.} \end{array}
$$

The net heat flux follows then as

$$
q_{\mathrm{net}} = 0.054\times 5.760\times 10^{-8}\times 350^{4} - 0.939\times 1000\times \cos 30^{\circ} = -767\mathrm{W / m^{2}}.
$$

Actually, neither  $f(\lambda_{c}T_{\mathrm{coll}})\simeq 0$  nor  $f(\lambda_{c}T_{\mathrm{sun}})\simeq 1$  is particularly sensitive to the exact value of  $\lambda_{c}$ , because there is very little spectral overlap between solar radiation (95% of which is in the wavelength range of  $\lambda < 2.2\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) and blackbody emission at 350K (95% of which is at  $\lambda >5.4\mu \mathrm{m}$ ).

Surfaces can be made directionally selective by mechanically altering the surface finish on a microscale (microgrooves) or macroscale. For example, large V- grooves (large compared with the wavelengths of radiation) tend to reflect incoming radiation several times for near- normal incidence, as indicated in Fig. 3- 35 (from Trombe and coworkers [101]) for an opening angle of  $\gamma = 30^{\circ}$ , each time absorbing a fraction of the beam. The number of reflections decreases with increasing incidence angle, down to a single reflection for incidence angles  $\theta >90^{\circ} - \gamma$  (or  $60^{\circ}$  in the case of Fig. 3- 35). Hollands [102] has shown that this type of surface has a significantly higher normal emittance, which is important for collection of solar irradiation, than hemispherical emittance, which governs emission losses. A similarly shaped material, with flat black bottoms, was theoretically analyzed by Perlmutter and Howell [103]. Their analytical values for directional emittance were experimentally confirmed by Brandenberg and Clausen [27], as illustrated in Fig. 3- 36.

# 3.10 EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

It is quite apparent from the discussion in the preceding sections that, although electromagnetic wave theory can be used to augment experimental data, it cannot replace them. While the spectral, bidirectional reflection function, equation (3.34), is the most basic radiation property of an opaque surface, to which all other properties can be related, it is rarely measured. Obtaining the bidirectional reflection function is difficult because of the low achievable signal strength. It is also impractical since it is a function of both incoming and outgoing directions and of wavelength and temperature. A complete description of the surface requires enormous amounts of data. In addition, the use of the bidirectional reflection function complicates the analysis to such a point that it is rarely attempted.

If bidirectional data are not required it is sufficient, for an opaque material, to measure one of the following, from which all other ones may be inferred: absorptance, emittance, directional- hemispherical reflectance, and hemispherical- directional reflectance. Various different measurement techniques have been developed, which may be separated into three loosely- defined groups: calorimetric emission measurements, radiometric emission measurements, and reflection measurements. The interest in experimental methods was at its peak during the 1960s as a result of the advent of the space age. Compilations covering the literature of that period have been

given in two NASA publications [104, 105]. Interest waned during the 1970s and 1980s but has recently picked up again because of the development of better and newer materials operating at higher temperatures. Sacadura [106] has given an updated review of experimental methods.

While measurement techniques vary widely from method to method, most of them employ similar optical components, such as light sources, monochromators, and detectors. Therefore, we shall begin our discussion of experimental methods with a short description of important optical components.

# Instrumentation

Radiative property measurements generally require a light source, a monochromator, a detector, and the components of the optical path, such as mirrors, lenses, beam splitters, optical windows, and so on. Depending on the nature of the experiment and/or detector, other accessories, such as optical choppers, may also be necessary.

LIGHT SOURCES. Light sources are required for the measurement of absorption by, or reflection from, an opaque surface, as well as for the alignment of optical components in any spectroscopic system. In addition, light sources are needed for transmission and scattering measurements of absorbing/scattering media, such as gases, particles, and semitransparent solids, and liquids (to be discussed in later chapters). We distinguish between monochromatic and polychromatic light sources.

Monochromatic sources. These types of sources operate through stimulated emission, producing light over an extremely narrow wavelength range. Their monochromaticity, low beam divergence, coherence, and high power concentration make lasers particularly attractive as light sources. While only invented some 30 years ago, there are today literally dozens of solid- state and gas lasers covering the spectrum between the ultraviolet and the far infrared. Although lasers are generally monochromatic, there are a number of gas lasers that can be tuned over a part of the spectrum by stimulating different transitions. For example, dye lasers (using large organic dye molecules as the lasing medium) may be operated at a large number of wavelengths in the range  $0.2\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < 1\mu \mathrm{m},$  while the common  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  laser (usually operating at  $10.6\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) may be equipped with a movable grating, allowing it to lase at a large number of wavelengths in the range  $9\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < 11\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Even solid- state lasers can be operated at several wavelengths through frequency- doubling. For example, the Nd- YAG laser, the most common solid- state laser, can be used at  $1.064\mu \mathrm{m}, 0.532\mu \mathrm{m}, 0.355\mu \mathrm{m},$  and  $0.266\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Of particular importance for radiative property measurements is the helium- neon laser because of its low price and small size and because it operates in the visible at  $0.633\mu \mathrm{m}$  (making it useful for optical alignment).

A different kind of monochromatic source is the low- pressure gas discharge lamp, in which a low- density electric current passes through a low- pressure gas. Gas atoms and molecules become ionized and conduct the current. Electrons bound to the gas atoms become excited to higher energy levels, from which they fall again, emitting radiation over a number of narrow spectral lines whose wavelengths are characteristic of the gas used, such as zinc, mercury, and so on.

Polychromatic sources. These usually incandescent light sources emit radiation by spontaneous emission due to the thermal excitation of source atoms and molecules, resulting in a continuous spectrum. The spectral distribution and total radiated power depend on the temperature, area, and emittance of the surface. Incandescent sources may be of the filament type (similar to an ordinary light bulb) or of the bare- element type. The quartz- tungsten- halogen lamp has a doped tungsten filament inside a quartz envelope, which is filled with a rare gas and a small amount of a halogen. Operating at a filament temperature greater than  $3000\mathrm{K}$ , this lamp produces a near- blackbody spectrum with maximum emission below  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$ . However, because of the transmission characteristics of quartz (which is the same as fused silica, Fig. 3- 28), there is no appreciable emission beyond  $3\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Bare- element sources are either rods

of silicon carbide, called globars, or heating wires embedded in refractory oxides, called Nernst glowers. Globars operate at a temperature of  $1000\mathrm{K}$  and produce an almost- gray spectrum with a maximum around  $2.9\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Nernst glowers operate at temperatures up to  $1500\mathrm{K}$ , with a somewhat less ideal spectral distribution. The irradiation onto a distant surface from different incandescent sources is shown in Fig. 3- 37. None of the light sources shown in Fig. 3- 37 has a truly "black" spectral distribution, since their output is influenced by their spectral emittance. In most experiments this is of little importance since, in general, sample and reference signals (coming from the same spectral source) are compared. If a true blackbody source is required (primarily for calibration of instruments), blackbody cavity sources are available from a number of manufacturers. In these sources a cylindrical and/or conical cavity, made of a high- temperature, high- emittance material (such as silicon carbide) is heated to a desired temperature. Radiation leaving the cavity, also commonly called Hohlraum (German for "hollow space"), is essentially black (cf. Table 5.1).

The brightest conventional source of optical radiation is the high- pressure gas discharge lamp, which combines the characteristics of spontaneous and stimulated emission. The lamp is similar to a low- pressure gas discharge source, but with high current density and gas pressure. This configuration results in an arc with highly excited atoms and molecules forming a plasma. While the hot plasma emits as an incandescent source, ionized atoms emit over substantially broadened spectral lines, resulting in a mixed spectrum (Fig. 3- 37). Commonly used gases for such arc sources are xenon, mercury, and deuterium.

SPECTRAL SEPARATORS. Spectral radiative properties can be measured over part of the spectrum in one of two ways: (i) Measurements are made using a variety of monochromatic light sources, which adequately represent the desired part of the spectrum, or (ii) a polychromatic source is used together with a device that allows light of only a few select wavelengths to reach the detector. Such devices may consist of simple optical filters, manually driven or motorized monochromators, or highly sophisticated FTIR (Fourier Transform IntraRed) spectrometers.

Optical filters. These are multilayer thin- film devices that selectively transmit radiation only over desired ranges of wavelengths. Bandpass filters transmit light only over a finite, usually narrow, wavelength region, while edge filters transmit only above or below certain cutoff or edge wavelengths. Bandpass filters consist of a series of thin dielectric films that, at each interface, partially reflect and partially transmit radiation (cf. Fig. 2- 13). The spacing between layers is such that beams of the desired wavelength are, after multiple reflections within the layers, in phase with the transmitted beam (constructive interference). Other wavelengths are rejected

![](images/4998d0066072c7e74cfbbb2e68c3118a38d7bf14429e4ee38fff51e4799b1ac2.jpg)  
FIGURE 3-38 Schematic of spectral separation with (a) a transparent prism, (b) a diffraction grating.

because they destructively interfere with one another. Bandpass filters for any conceivable wavelength between the ultraviolet and the midinfrared are routinely manufactured. Edge filters operate on the same principle, but are more complex in design.

Monochromators. These devices separate an incoming polychromatic beam into its spectral components. They generally consist of an entrance slit, a prism or grating that spreads the incoming light according to its wavelengths, and an exit slit, which allows only light of desired wavelengths to escape. If a prism is used, it is made of a highly- transparent material with a refractive index that varies slightly across the spectrum (cf. Fig. 3- 16). As shown in Fig. 3- 38a, the incoming radiant energy is separated into its constituent wavelengths since, by Snell's law, the prism bends different wavelengths (with different refractive index) by different amounts. Rotating the prism around an axis allows different wavelengths to escape through the exit slit. Instead of a prism one can use a diffraction grating to separate the wavelengths of incoming light, employing the principle of constructive and destructive interference [107], as schematically indicated in Fig. 3- 38b. Until a few years ago all monochromators employed salt prisms, while today almost all systems employ diffraction gratings, since they are considerably cheaper and simpler to handle (salt prisms tend to be hygroscopic, i.e., they are attacked by the water vapor in the surrounding air). However, diffraction gratings have the disadvantages that their spectral range is more limited (necessitating devices with multiple gratings), and they may give erroneous readings due to higher- order signals (frequency- doubling).

FTIR spectrometers. These instruments collect the entire radiant energy (i.e., comprising all FTIR spectrometer wavelengths) after reflection from a moving mirror. The measured intensity depends on the position of the moving mirror owing to constructive and destructive interference. This signal is converted by a computer through an inverse Fast Fourier Transform into a power vs. wavelength plot. The spectral range of FTIRs is limited only by the choice of beam splitters and detectors, and is comparable to that of prism monochromators. However, while monochromators generally require several minutes to collect data over their entire spectral range, the FTIR is able to do this in a fraction of a second. Detailed descriptions of the operation of FTIRs may be found in books on the subject, such as the one by Griffiths and de Haseth [108].

DETECTORS. In a typical spectroscopic experiment the detector measures the intensity of incoming radiation due to transmission through, emission from, or reflection by, a sample. This irradiation may be relatively monochromatic (i.e., covers a very narrow wavelength range after having passed through a filter or monochromator), or may be polychromatic (for total emittance measurements, or if an FTIR is used). In either case, the detector converts the beam's power into an electrical signal, which is amplified and recorded. The performance of detectors is measured by certain criteria, which are generally functions of several operating conditions, such as wavelength, temperature, modulating frequency, bias voltage, and gain of any internal amplifier. The response time  $(\tau)$  is the time for a detector's output to reach  $1 - 1 / e = 63\%$  of its final value, after suddenly being subjected to constant irradiation. The linearity range of a detector is the range of input power over which the output signal is a linear function of the input. The noise equivalent power (NEP) is the radiant energy rate in watts that is necessary to give an output signal equal to the rms noise output from the detector. More widely used is the

FIGURE 3-39 Schematic of (a) a pyroelectric detector, (b) a photoconductive detector.

reciprocal of NEP, the detectivity  $(D)$ . The detectivity is known to vary inversely with the square root of the detector area,  $\Delta_{D}$ , while the signal noise is proportional to the square root of the amplifier's noise- equivalent bandwidth  $\Delta f$  (in  $\mathrm{Hz}$ ). Thus, a normalized detectivity  $(D^{*})$  is defined to allow comparison between different types of detectors regardless of their detector areas and amplifier bandwidths as

$$
D^{*} = (A_{D}\Delta f)^{1 / 2}D. \tag{3.107}
$$

Depending on how the incoming radiation interacts with the detector material, detectors are grouped into thermal and photon (or quantum) detectors.

Thermal detectors. These devices convert incident radiation into a temperature rise. This temperature change is measured either through one or more thermocouples, or by using the pyroelectric effect. A single, usually blackened (to increase absorptance) thermocouple is the simplest and cheapest of all thermal detectors. However, it suffers from high amplifier noise and, therefore, limited detectivity. One way to increase output voltage and detectivity is to connect a number of thermocouples in series (typically 20 to 120), constituting a thermopile. Thermopiles can be manufactured economically through thin- film processes. Pyroelectric detectors are made of crystalline materials that have permanent electric polarization. When heated by irradiation, the material expands and changes its polarization, which causes a current to flow in a circuit that connects the detector's top and bottom surfaces, as shown in the schematic of Fig. 3- 39a. Since the change in temperature produces the current, pyroelectric detectors respond only to pulsed or chopped irradiation. They respond to changes in irradiation much more rapidly than thermocouples and thermopiles, and are not affected by steady background radiation.

Photon detectors. These absorb the energy of incident radiation with their electrons, producing free charge carriers (photoconductive and photovoltaic detectors) or even ejecting electrons from the material (photoemissive detectors). In photoconductive and photovoltaic detectors the production of free electrons increases the electrical conductivity of the material. In the photoconductive mode an applied voltage, or reverse bias, causes a current that is proportional to the strength of irradiation to flow, as schematically shown in Fig. 3- 39b. In the photovoltaic mode no bias is applied and, closing the electric circuit, a current flows as a result of the excitation of electrons (as in the operation of photovoltaic, or solar, cells). Photovoltaic detectors have greater detectivity, while photoconductive detectors exhibit extremely fast response times. For optimum performance each mode requires slightly different design, although a single device may be operated in either mode. Typical semiconductor materials used for photovoltaic and photoconductive detectors are silicon (Si), germanium (Ge), indium antimonide (InSb), mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe), lead sulfide and selenide (PbS and PbSe), and cadmium sulfide (CdS). While most semiconductor detectors have a single detector element, many of them today

![](images/a8e502668c5a1598f6bcf56c3fa494f64741f2a386d67a88398166438ed1b52f.jpg)  
FIGURE 3-40 Typical spectral ranges and normalized detectivities for various detectors.

are also available as linear arrays and surface arrays (up to  $512 \times 512$  elements), which—when combined with a monochromator—allows for ultra- fast data acquisition at many wavelengths.

The most basic photoemissive device is a photodiode, in which high- energy photons (ultraviolet to near infrared) cause emission of electrons from photocathode surfaces placed in a vacuum. Applying a voltage causes a current that is proportional to the intensity of incident radiation to flow. The signal of a vacuum photodiode is amplified in a photomultiplier by fitting it with a series of anodes (called dynodes), which produce secondary emission electrons and a current. The latter is an order- of- magnitude higher than the original photocurrent.

Thermal detectors generally respond evenly across the entire spectrum, while photon detectors have limited spectral response but higher detectivity and faster response times. The normalized detectivity of several detectors is compared in Fig. 3- 40. The spectral response of photon detectors can be tailored to a degree by varying the relative amounts of detector material components. The response time of thermal detectors is relatively slow, normally in the order of milliseconds, while the response time of photon detectors ranges from microseconds to a few nanoseconds. The detectivity is often increased by cooling the detector thermoelectrically (to  $- 30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ), with dry ice (195 K), or by attaching it to a liquid- nitrogen Dewar flask (77 K).

OTHER COMPONENTS. In a spectroscopic experiment light from a source and/or sample is guided toward the detector by a number of mirrors and lenses. Plane mirrors are employed to bend the beam path while curved mirrors are used to focus an otherwise diverging beam onto a sample, the monochromator entrance slit, or the detector. Today's optical mirrors provide extremely high reflectivities ( $>99.5\%$ ) over the entire spectrum of interest. While focusing mirrors are generally preferable for a number of reasons, sometimes lenses need to be used for focusing. The most important drawbacks of lenses are that they tend to have relatively large reflection losses and their spectral range (with high transmissivity) is limited. While antireflection coatings can be applied, these coatings are generally only effective over narrow spectral ranges as a result of interference effects. Common lens materials for the infrared are zinc selenide (ZnSe), calcium fluoride ( $\mathrm{CaF}_2$ ), germanium (Ge), and others. Sometimes it is necessary to split a beam into two portions (e.g., to create a reference beam that does not pass over the sample) using a beam splitter. Beam splitters are made of the same material as lenses,

exploiting their reflecting and transmitting tendencies. It is also common to chop the beam using a mechanical chopper, which consists of a rotating blade with one or more holes or slits. Chopping may be done for a variety of reasons, such as to provide an alternating signal for a pyroelectric detector, to separate background radiation from desired radiation, to decrease electronic noise by using a lock- in amplifier tuned into the chopper frequency, and so on.

# Calorimetric Emission Measurement Methods

If only knowledge of the total, hemispherical emittance of a surface is required, this is most commonly determined by measuring the net radiative heat loss or gain of an isolated specimen [109- 125]. Figure 3- 41 shows a typical experimental setup, which was used by Funai [110]. The specimen is suspended inside an evacuated test chamber, the walls of which are coated with a near- black material. The chamber walls are cooled, while the specimen is heated electrically, directly (metallic samples), through a metal substrate (nonconducting samples), or by some other means. Temperatures of the specimen and chamber wall are monitored by thermocouples. The emittance of the sample can be determined from steady- state [109- 117] or transient measurements [111, 118- 125].

In the steady- state method the sample is heated to, and kept at, a desired temperature by passing the appropriate current through the heating element. The total, hemispherical emittance may then be calculated by equating electric heat input to the specimen with the radiative heat loss from the specimen to the surroundings, or

$$
\epsilon (T) = \frac{I^2R}{A_s\sigma(T_s^4 - T_w^4)}, \tag{3.108}
$$

where  $I^2 R$  is the dissipated electrical power,  $A_{s}$  is the exposed surface area of the specimen, and  $T_{s}$  and  $T_{w}$  are the temperatures of specimen and chamber walls, respectively. As will be discussed in Chapter 5, equation (3.108) assumes that the surface area of the chamber is much larger than  $A_{s}$  and/or that the emittance of the chamber wall is near unity [cf. equation (5.36)].

In the transient calorimetric technique the current is switched off when the desired temperature has been reached, and the rates of loss of internal energy and radiative heat loss are equated, or

$$
\epsilon (T) = -\frac{m_s c_s d T_s / d t}{A_s\sigma(T_s^4 - T_w^4)}, \tag{3.109}
$$

where  $m_{s}$  and  $c_{s}$  are mass and specific heat of the sample, respectively.

FIGURE 3-42 Emissometer with separate reference blackbody and two optical paths [126].

# Radiometric Emission Measurement Methods

High- temperature, spectral, directional surface emittances are most often determined by comparing the emission from a sample with that from a blackbody at the same temperature and wavelength, both viewed by the same detector over an identical or equivalent optical path. Under those conditions the signal from both measurements will be proportional to emitted intensity (with the same proportionality constant), and the spectral, directional emittance is found by taking the ratio of the two signals, or

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(T,\lambda ,\theta ,\psi) = \frac{I_{\lambda}(T,\lambda,\theta,\psi)}{I_{b\lambda}(T,\lambda)}. \tag{3.110}
$$

The comparison blackbody may be a separate blackbody kept at the same temperature, or it may be an integral part of the sample chamber. The latter is generally preferred at high temperatures, where temperature control is difficult, and for short wavelengths, where small deviations in temperatures can cause large inaccuracies.

Separate reference blackbody. In this method a blackbody, usually a long, cylindrical, isothermal cavity with an  $L / D$ - ratio larger than 4, is kept separate from the sample chamber, while both are heated to the same temperature. Radiation coming from this Hohlraum is essentially black (cf. Table 5.1). The control system keeps the sample and blackbody at the same temperature by monitoring temperature differences with a differential thermocouple and taking corrective action whenever necessary. To monitor sample and blackbody emission via an identical optical path, either two identical paths have to be constructed, or sample and blackbody must be alternately placed into the single optical path. In the former method, identical paths are formed either through two sets of optics [126], or by moving optical components back and forth [39]. Figure 3- 42 shows an example of a system with two different optical paths [126], while Fig. 3- 43 is an example of a linearly actuated blackbody/sample arrangement [127]. It is also possible to combine blackbody and sample, and the device is rotated or moved back- and- forth inside a single furnace [128]. Markham and coworkers [129] mounted sample/reference blackbody individually on a turntable, heated them with a torch, and measured the directional, spectral emittance of sandblasted aluminum (up to 750 K), alumina (1300 to 2200 K), fused quartz (900 K), and sapphire (1000 K) with an FTIR spectrometer. Other materials measured with the separate reference blackbody technique include the normal, spectral emittance of solid and liquid silicon just below and above the melting point [130], and of a collection of 30 metals and alloys at temperatures up to  $1200^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  [131, 132].

![](images/0f8ec8c90442f9e82195185fd48d596aafb8b01317b627092f3a76618d331864.jpg)  
FIGURE 3-43 Emissometer with separate reference blackbody and linearly actuated sample/blackbody arrangement [127].

Integrated reference blackbody. At high temperatures it is preferable to incorporate the reference blackbody into the design of the sample furnace. If the sample rests at the bottom of a deep isothermal, cylindrical cavity, the radiation leaving the sample (by emission and reflection) corresponds to that of a black surface. If the hot side wall is removed or replaced by a cold one, radiation leaving the sample is due to emission only. Taking the ratio of the two signals then allows the determination of the spectral, directional emittance from equation (3.110). Removing the reflection component from the signal may be achieved in one of two ways. Several researchers have used a tubular furnace with the sample mounted on a movable rod [133- 135]. When the sample is deep inside the furnace the signal corresponds to a blackbody. The sample is then rapidly moved to the exit of the furnace and the signal is due to emission alone. Disadvantages of the method are  $(i)$  maintaining isothermal conditions up to close to the end of the tube,  $(ii)$  keeping the sample at the same temperature after displacement, and  $(iii)$  stress on the high- temperature sample due to the rapid movement. In the approach of Vader and coworkers [136] and Postlethwait et al. [137], reflection from the sample is suppressed by freely dropping a cold tube into the blackbody cavity. A schematic of the apparatus of Postlethwait et al. is shown in Fig. 3- 44. Once the cold tube has been dropped, measurements must be taken rapidly (in a few seconds' time), before substantial heating of the drop tube (and cooling of the sample). Vader and coworkers obtained spectral measurements by placing various filters in front of their detector, performing a number of drops for each sample temperature. Postlethwait employed an FTIR spectrometer, allowing them to measure the entire spectral range from  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$  to  $9\mu \mathrm{m}$  in a single drop. In a method more akin to the separate blackbody technique, Havstad and colleagues [128] incorporated a small blackbody cavity into a tungsten crucible (holding liquid metal samples). The entire assembly is then moved to have the optics focus on sample or blackbody, respectively.

# Reflection Measurements

Reflection measurements are carried out to determine the bidirectional reflection function, the directional- hemispherical reflectance, and the hemispherical- directional reflectance. The latter two provide indirect means to determine the directional absorptance and emittance of opaque specimens, in particular, if sample temperatures are too low for emission measurements.

FIGURE 3-45 Schematic of the bidirectional reflection measurement apparatus of Birkebak and Eckert [138].  
FIGURE 3-44 Schematic of a drop-tube emissometer [137].

BIDIRECTIONAL REFLECTION MEASUREMENTS. If the bidirectional reflection behavior of a surface is of interest, the bidirectional reflection function,  $\rho_{A}^{\prime \prime}$ , must be measured directly, by irradiating the sample with a collimated beam from one direction and collecting the reflected intensity over various small solid angles. A sketch of an early apparatus used by Birkebak and Eckert [138] and Torrance and Sparrow [139] is shown in Fig. 3- 45. Radiation from a globar  $A$  travels through a diaphragm to a spherical mirror  $SM$ , which focuses it onto the test sample  $S$ . A pencil of radiation reflected from the sample into the desired direction is collected by another spherical mirror and focused onto the entrance slit of the monochromator, in which the wavelengths are separated by the rock salt prism  $P$ , and the signal is recorded by the thermopile  $T$ . The test sample is mounted on a multiple- yoke apparatus, which allows independent rotation around three perpendicular axes. The resulting measurements are relative (i.e., abso

![](images/ffa70055d2686c74adf45c63b3901db8582a21a18cec7aa821a24c647463dc83.jpg)  
FIGURE 3-46 Schematic of a heated cavity reflectometer [146].

lute values can only be obtained by calibrating the apparatus with a known standard in place of the test sample). Example measurements for magnesium oxide are shown in Fig. 3- 5 [12]. More recently built devices use sophisticated, multiple- degree- of- freedom sample mounts as well as FTIR spectrometers, such as the one of Ford and coworkers [140], who measured the bidirectional reflectances of diffuse gold and grooved nickel.

The main problem with bidirectional reflection measurements is the low level of reflected radiation that must be detected (particularly in off- specular directions), even with the advent of FTIR spectrometers and highly sensitive detectors. Consequently, a number of designs have employed strong monochromatic laser sources to overcome this problem, for example, [141- 145].

An overview of the different methods to determine directional- hemispherical and hemispherical- directional reflectances has been given by Touloukian and DeWitt [6]. The different types of experiments may be grouped into three categories, heated cavity reflectometers, integrating sphere reflectometers, and integrating mirror reflectometers, each having their own ranges of applicability, advantages, and shortcomings.

HEATED CAVITY REFLECTOMETERS. The heated cavity reflectometer [6, 146- 148] (sometimes known as the Gier- Dunkle reflectometer after its inventors [148]) consists of a uniformly heated enclosure fitted with a water- cooled sample holder and a viewport, as schematically shown in Fig. 3- 46. Since the sample is situated within a more or less closed isothermal enclosure, the intensity striking it from any direction is essentially equal to the blackbody intensity  $I_{b\lambda}(T_w)$  (evaluated at the cavity- wall temperature,  $T_w$ ). Images of the sample and a spot on the cavity wall are alternately focused onto the entrance slit of a monochromator. The signal from the specimen corresponds to emission (at the sample's temperature,  $T_s$ ) plus reflection of the cavity- wall's blackbody intensity,  $I_{b\lambda}(T_w)$ . Since the signal from the cavity wall is proportional to  $I_{b\lambda}(T_w)$ , the ratio of the two signals corresponds to

$$
\frac{I_s}{I_w} = \frac{\rho_\lambda^{\prime\prime}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{b\lambda}(T_w) + \epsilon_\lambda'(\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{b\lambda}(T_s)}{I_{b\lambda}(T_w)}. \tag{3.111}
$$

If the sample is relatively cold  $(T_s \ll T_w)$ , emission may be neglected and the device simply measures the hemispherical- directional reflectance. For higher specimen temperatures, and for

![](images/c7e3c1d45549ad882cf621892e88a5c69d3ab8153ec8c7b79d426943c81cfde1.jpg)

an opaque surface with diffuse irradiation, from equations (3.42), (3.39) and (3.44),

$$
\rho^{\ominus_{\lambda}^{\prime}}(\mathfrak{s}) = \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathfrak{s}) = 1 - \alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathfrak{s}) = 1 - \epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathfrak{s}), \tag{3.112}
$$

and

$$
\frac{I_s}{I_w} = 1 - \epsilon_\lambda '\left(\mathfrak{s}\right)\left[1 - \frac{I_{b\lambda}(T_s)}{I_{b\lambda}(T_w)}\right]. \tag{3.113}
$$

The principal source of error in this method is the difficulty in making the entire cavity reasonably isothermal and (as a consequence) making the reference signal proportional to a blackbody at the cavity- wall temperature. To make these errors less severe the method is generally only used for low sample temperatures.

INTEGRATING SPHERE REFLECTOMETERS. These devices are most commonly employed for reflectance measurements [147,149- 159] and are available commercially in a variety of forms, either as separate instruments or already incorporated into spectrophotometers. A good early discussion of different designs was given by Edwards and coworkers [154]. The integrating sphere may be used to measure hemispherical- directional or directional- hemispherical reflectance, depending on whether it is used in indirect or direct mode. Schematics of integrating spheres operating in the two modes are shown in Fig. 3- 47. The ideal device is coated on its inside with a material of high and perfectly diffuse reflectance. The most common material in use is smoked magnesium oxide, which reflects strongly and very diffusely up to  $\lambda \simeq 2.6\mu \mathrm{m}$  (cf. Fig. 3- 5). Other materials, such as "diffuse gold" [155- 158], have been used to overcome the wavelength limitations. The strong, diffuse reflectance, together with the spherical geometry, assures that any external radiation hitting the surface of the sphere is converted into a perfectly diffuse intensity field due to many diffuse reflections. In the direct method the sample is illuminated directly by an external source, as shown in Fig. 3- 47a. All of the reflected radiation is collected by the sphere and converted into a diffuse intensity field, which is measured by a detector. Similar readings are then taken on a comparison standard of known reflectance, under the same conditions. The sample may be removed and replaced by the standard (substitution method); or there may be separate sample and standard holders, which are alternately irradiated by the external source (comparison method), the latter being generally preferred. In the indirect method a spot on the sphere surface is irradiated while the detector measures the intensity reflected by the sample (or the comparison standard) directly.

Errors in integrating sphere measurements are primarily caused by imperfections of the surface coating (imperfectly diffuse reflectance), losses out of apertures, and unwanted irradiation onto the detector (direct reflection from the sample in the direct mode, direct reflection from the externally- irradiated spot on the sphere in the indirect mode). Because of temperature sensitivity of the diffuse coatings, integrating- sphere measurements have mostly been limited

![](images/307395db711a577895003711527c9dd8af7061bbe4ec083ed9b393c2c1ce458b.jpg)

to moderate temperature levels. However, for monochromatic and high- speed FTIR measurements it is possible to rapidly heat up only the sample by a high- power source, such as a laser, as was done by Zhang and Modest [160].

INTEGRATING MIRROR REFLECTOMETERS. An alternative to the integrating sphere is a similar design utilizing an integrating mirror. Mirrors in general have high reflectivities in the infrared and are much more efficient than integrating spheres and, hence, are highly desirable in the infrared where the energy of the light source is low. On the other hand, it is difficult to collect the radiant energy, reflected by the sample into the hemisphere above it, into a parallel beam of small cross- section. For this reason, an integrating mirror reflectometer requires a large detector area. There are three types of integrating mirrors: hemispherical [161], paraboloidal [146, 162] and ellipsoidal [163- 169]. Schematics of the three different types are shown in Fig. 3- 48. The principle of operation of all three is the same, only the shape of the mirror is different. Each of these mirrors has two conjugate focal points, i.e., if a point source of light is placed at one focal point, all radiation will, after reflection off the mirror, fall onto the second focal point. Thus, in the integrating mirror technique an external beam is focused onto the sample, which is located at one of the focal points, through a small opening in the mirror. Radiation reflected from the sample into any direction will be reflected by the integrating mirror and is then collected by the detector located at the other focal point. This technique yields the directional- hemispherical reflectance of the sample, after comparison with a reference signal. Alternatively, one of the focal points can hold a blackbody source, with the ellipsoidal mirror focusing the energy onto the sample at the second focal point. Radiation leaving the sample is then probed through a small hole in the

mirror and spectrally resolved and detected by a monochromator or FTIR spectrometer, yielding the hemispherical- directional reflectance of the sample [169]. Sources for error in the integrating mirror method are absorption by the mirror, energy lost through the entrance port, nonuniform angular response of detectors, and energy missing the detector owing to mirror aberrations. To minimize aberrations, ellipsoids are preferable over hemispheres. The method has generally been limited to relatively large wavelengths,  $>2.5\mu \mathrm{m}$  (because of mirror limitations), and to moderate temperatures. Designs allowing sample temperatures up to about  $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  have been reported by Battuello and coworkers [167], Ravindra and colleagues [170], and by Freeman et al. [171], while the torch- heated sample of Markham and coworkers' design [169] allows sample temperatures up to  $2000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . In general, integrating mirrors are somewhat less popular than integrating spheres because mirrors are more sensitive to flux losses and misalignment errors.

The disk is at ambient temperature when the laser is turned on. The emittance of the disk surface is

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0.2, & \lambda < 6\mu \mathrm{m},\\ 0.9\cos \theta , & \lambda >6\mu \mathrm{m}. \end{array} \right.

3.23 Two aluminum plates, one covered with a layer of white enamel paint, the other polished, are directly facing the sun, which is irradiating the plates with  $1000\mathrm{W / m^2}$ . Assuming that convection/conduction losses of the plates to the environment at  $500\mathrm{K}$  can be calculated by using a heat transfer coefficient of  $10\mathrm{W / m^2K}$ , and that the back sides of the plates are insulated, estimate the equilibrium temperature of each plate.

(c) Develop an approximate relation for the directional, spectral emittance of the metal substrate for large wavelengths and moderate incidence angles, say  $\theta < 75^{\circ}$ .

3.25 A plate of metal with  $n_2 = k_2 = 100$  is covered with a dielectric as shown. The dielectric has an absorption band such that  $n_1 = 2$ , and  $k_{1} = 1$  for  $0.2\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < 2\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $k_{1} = 0$  elsewhere. The dielectric is thick enough, such that any light traveling through it of wavelengths  $0.2\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < 2\mu \mathrm{m}$  is entirely absorbed before it reaches the metal.

On its top the surface loses heat by radiation and by free convection (heat transfer coefficient  $h_1 = 10\mathrm{W / m^2K}$ ), both to an atmosphere at  $T_{\mathrm{amb}} = 20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . The bottom surface delivers heat to the collector fluid  $(h_2 = 50\mathrm{W / m^2K})$ , which flows past the surface at  $T_{\mathrm{fluid}} = 20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . What is the equilibrium temperature of the collector plate? How much energy (per unit area) is collected (i.e., carried away by the fluid)? Discuss the performance of this collector.

# VIEW FACTORS

# 4.1 INTRODUCTION

In many engineering applications the exchange of radiative energy between surfaces is virtually unaffected by the medium that separates them. Such (radiatively) nonparticipating media include vacuum as well as monatomic and most diatomic gases (including air) at low to moderate temperature levels (i.e., before ionization and dissociation occurs). Examples include spacecraft heat rejection systems, solar collector systems, radiative space heaters, illumination problems, and so on.

In the following four chapters we shall consider the analysis of surface radiation transport, i.e., radiative heat transfer in the absence of a participating medium, for different levels of complexity. It is common practice to simplify the analysis by making the assumption of an idealized enclosure and/or of ideal surface properties.

The greatest simplification arises if all surfaces are black: for such a situation no reflected radiation needs to be accounted for, and all emitted radiation is diffuse (i.e., the intensity leaving a surface does not depend on direction). The next level of difficulty arises if surfaces are assumed to be gray, diffuse emitters (and, thus, absorbers) as well as gray, diffuse reflectors. The vast majority of engineering calculations are limited to such ideal surfaces, which are the topic of Chapter 5.

If the reflective behavior of a surface deviates strongly from a diffuse reflector (e.g., a polished metal, which reflects almost like a mirror) one may often approximate the reflectance to consist of a purely diffuse and a purely specular component. This situation is discussed in Chapter 6. However, if greater accuracy is desired, if the reflectance cannot be approximated by purely diffuse and specular components, or if the assumption of a gray surface is not acceptable, a more general approach must be taken. A few such methods are briefly outlined in Chapter 7.

As discussed in Chapter 1 thermal radiation is generally a long- range phenomenon. This is always the case in the absence of a participating medium, since photons will travel unimpeded from surface to surface. Therefore, performing a thermal radiation analysis for one surface implies that all surfaces, no matter how far removed, that can exchange radiative energy with one another must be considered simultaneously. How much energy any two surfaces exchange depends in part on their size, separation distance, and orientation, leading to geometric functions known as view factors. In the present chapter these view factors are developed for gray, diffusely radiating (i.e., emitting and reflecting) surfaces. However, the view factor is a very basic function that will also be employed in the analysis of specular reflectors as well as for the analysis for surfaces with arbitrary emission and reflection properties.

Making an energy balance on a surface element, as shown in Fig. 4- 1, we find

![](images/e4f9303b2a5756f43a97b54cf6d89514823061cb17184c9801ee1eedf89dcdbe.jpg)  
FIGURE 4-1 Surface energy balance.

$$
q = q_{\mathrm{emission}} - q_{\mathrm{absorption}} = E - \alpha H. \tag{4.1}
$$

In this relation  $q_{\mathrm{emission}}$  and  $q_{\mathrm{absorption}}$  are absolute values with directions as given by Fig. 4- 1, while  $q$  is the net heat flux supplied to the surface, as defined in Chapter 1 by equation (1.38). According to this definition  $q$  is positive if the heat is coming from inside the wall material, by conduction or other means  $(q > 0)$ , and negative if going from the enclosure into the wall  $(q < 0)$ . Alternatively, the heat flux may be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & q = q_{\mathrm{out}} - q_{\mathrm{in}} = (q_{\mathrm{emission}} + q_{\mathrm{reflection}}) - q_{\mathrm{irradiation}}\\ & \quad = (E + \rho H) - H, \end{array} \tag{4.2}
$$

which is, of course, the same as equation (4.1) since, for opaque surfaces,  $\rho = 1 - \alpha$ . The irradiation  $H$  depends, in general, on the level of emission from surfaces far removed from the point under consideration, as schematically indicated in Fig. 4- 2a. Thus, in order to make a radiative energy balance we always need to consider an entire enclosure rather than an infinitesimal control volume (as is normally done for other modes of heat transfer, i.e., conduction or convection). The enclosure must be closed so that irradiation from all possible directions can be accounted for, and the enclosure surfaces must be opaque so that all irradiation is accounted for, for each direction. In practice, an incomplete enclosure may be closed by introducing artificial surfaces. An enclosure may be idealized in two ways, as indicated in Fig. 4- 2b: by replacing a complex geometrical shape with a few simple surfaces, and by assuming surfaces to be isothermal with constant (i.e., average) heat flux values across them. Obviously, the idealized enclosure approaches the real enclosure for sufficiently small isothermal subsurfaces.

# 4.2 DEFINITION OF VIEW FACTORS

4.2 DEFINITION OF VIEW FACTORSTo make an energy balance on a surface element, equation (4.1), the irradiation  $H$  must be evaluated. In a general enclosure the irradiation will have contributions from all visible parts of the enclosure surface. Therefore, we need to determine how much energy leaves an arbitrary surface element  $dA'$  that travels toward  $dA$ . The geometric relations governing this process for "diffuse" surfaces (for surfaces that absorb and emit diffusely, and also reflect radiative energy diffusely) are known as view factors. Other names used in the literature are configuration factor, angle factor, and shape factor, and sometimes the term diffuse view factor is used (to distinguish from specular view factors for specularly reflecting surfaces; see Chapter 6). The view factor between two infinitesimal surface elements  $dA_{i}$  and  $dA_{j}$ , as shown in Fig. 4- 3, is defined as

$$
dF_{dA_i - dA_j}\equiv \frac{\mathrm{diffuse~energy~leaving~}dA_i\mathrm{~directly~toward~and~intercepted~by~}dA_j}{\mathrm{total~diffuse~energy~leaving~}dA_i}, \tag{4.3}
$$

where the word "directly" is meant to imply "on a straight path, without intervening reflections." This view factor is infinitesimal since only an infinitesimal fraction can be intercepted by an infinitesimal area. From the definition of intensity and Fig. 4- 3 we may determine the heat transfer rate from  $dA_{i}$  to  $dA_{j}$  as

$$
I(\mathbf{r}_i)(dA_i\cos \theta_i)d\Omega_j = I(\mathbf{r}_i)\cos \theta_i\cos \theta_jdA_idA_j / S^2, \tag{4.4}
$$

where  $\theta_{i}$  (or  $\theta_{j}$  ) is the angle between the surface normal  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}_i$  (or  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}_j$  ) and the line connecting  $dA_{i}$  and  $dA_{j}$  (of length  $S$  ). The total radiative energy leaving  $dA_{i}$  into the hemisphere above it is  $J = E + \rho H,$  where  $J$  is called the radiosity. Since the surface emits and reflects diffusely both  $E$  and  $\rho H$  obey equation (1.33), and the outgoing flux may be related to intensity by

$$
J(\mathbf{r}_i)dA_i = [E(\mathbf{r}_i) + \rho (\mathbf{r}_i)H(\mathbf{r}_i)]dA_i = \pi I(\mathbf{r}_i)dA_i.
$$

Note that the radiative intensity away from  $dA_{i},$  due to emission and/or reflection, does not depend on direction. Therefore, the view factor between two infinitesimal areas is

$$
dF_{dA_i - dA_j} = \frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{\pi S^2} dA_j. \tag{4.5}
$$

By introducing the abbreviation  $\mathbf{s}_{ij} = \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i,$  and noting that cos  $\theta_{i} = \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{i}\cdot \mathbf{s}_{ij} / |\mathbf{s}_{ij}|,$  the view factor may be recast in vector form as

$$
dF_{dA_i - dA_j} = \frac{(\hat{\mathbf{n}}_i\cdot\mathbf{s}_{ij})(\hat{\mathbf{n}}_j\cdot\mathbf{s}_{ji})}{\pi S^4} dA_j. \tag{4.6}
$$

Switching subscripts  $j$  and  $j$  in equation (4.5) immediately leads to the important law of reciprocity,

$$
dA_{i}dF_{dA_{i} - dA_{j}} = dA_{j}dF_{dA_{j} - dA_{i}}. \tag{4.7}
$$

Often, enclosures are idealized to consist of a number of finite isothermal subsurfaces, as indicated in Fig. 4- 2b. Therefore, we should like to expand the definition of the view factor to include radiative exchange between one infinitesimal and one finite area, and between two finite areas. Consider first the exchange between an infinitesimal  $dA_{i}$  and a finite  $A_{j},$  as shown in Fig. 4- 4. The total energy leaving  $dA_{i}$  toward all of  $A_{j}$  is, from equation (4.4),

$$
I(\mathbf{r}_i)dA_i\int_{A_j}\frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{S^2} dA_j,
$$

![](images/604a9ff22831cea81230e390b1a670057f5368851de0b826dda68e8ab63a05b5.jpg)  
FIGURE 4-3 Radiative exchange between two infinitesimal surface elements.

FIGURE 4-4 Radiative exchange between one infinitesimal and one finite surface element.

while the total energy leaving the  $dA_{i}$  into all directions remains unchanged. Thus, we find

$$
F_{dA_i - A_j} = \int_{A_j}\frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{\pi S^2} dA_j, \tag{4.8}
$$

which is now finite since the intercepting surface,  $A_{j},$  is finite.

Next we consider the view factor from  $A_{j}$  to the infinitesimal  $dA_{i}$ . The amount of radiation leaving all of  $A_{j}$  toward  $dA_{i}$  is, from equation (4.4) (after switching subscripts  $i$  and  $j$ ),

$$
dA_{i}\int_{A_{j}}I(\mathbf{r}_{j})\frac{\cos\theta_{i}\cos\theta_{j}}{S^{2}} dA_{j},
$$

and the total amount leaving  $A_{j}$  into all directions is

$$
\pi \int_{A_j}I(\mathbf{r}_j)dA_j.
$$

Thus, we find the view factor between surfaces  $A_{j}$  and  $dA_{i}$  is

$$
dF_{A_j - dA_i} = \int_{A_j}I(\mathbf{r}_j)\frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{S^2} dA_jdA_i\bigg / \pi \int_{A_j}I(\mathbf{r}_j)dA_j, \tag{4.9}
$$

which is infinitesimal since the intercepting surface,  $dA_{i},$  is infinitesimal. The view factor in equation (4.9)- unlike equations (4.5) and (4.8)- is not a purely geometric parameter since it depends on the radiation field  $I(\mathbf{r}_j)$ . However, for an ideal enclosure as shown in Fig. 4- 2b, it is usually assumed that the intensity leaving any surface is not only diffuse but also does not vary across the surface, i.e.,  $I(\mathbf{r}_j) = I_j = \text{const}$ . With this assumption equation (4.9) becomes

$$
dF_{A_j - dA_i} = \frac{1}{A_j}\int_{A_j}\frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{\pi S^2} dA_jdA_i. \tag{4.10}
$$

Comparing this with equation (4.8) we find another law of reciprocity, with

$$
A_{j}dF_{A_{j} - dA_{i}} = dA_{i}F_{dA_{i} - A_{j}}, \tag{4.11}
$$

![](images/031f3acc4ccf1f28e89aa6dfb8995ee190c23617ee23db869aec352d8765ccd5.jpg)  
FIGURE 4-5 Radiative exchange between two finite surfaces.

subject to the restriction that the intensity leaving  $A_{j}$  does not vary across the surface.

Finally, we consider radiative exchange between two finite areas  $A_{i}$  and  $A_{j}$  as depicted in Fig. 4- 5. The total energy leaving  $A_{i}$  toward  $A_{j}$  is, from equation (4.4),

$$
\int_{A_i}\int_{A_j}I(\mathbf{r}_i)\frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{S^2} dA_jdA_i,
$$

and the view factor follows as

$$
F_{A_i - A_j} = \int_{A_i}\int_{A_j}I(\mathbf{r}_i)\frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{S^2} dA_jdA_i\bigg / \pi \int_{A_i}I(\mathbf{r}_i)dA_i. \tag{4.12}
$$

If we assume again that the intensity leaving  $A_{i}$  does not vary across the surface, the view factor reduces to

$$
F_{A_i - A_j} = \frac{1}{A_i}\int_{A_i}\int_{A_j}\frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{\pi S^2} dA_jdA_i. \tag{4.13}
$$

The law of reciprocity follows readily as

$$
A_{i}F_{A_{i} - A_{j}} = A_{j}F_{A_{j} - A_{i}}, \tag{4.14}
$$

which is now subject to the condition that the radiation intensities leaving  $A_{i}$  and  $A_{j}$  must both be constant across their respective surfaces.

In a somewhat more compact notation, the law of reciprocity may be summarized as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{dA_idF_{di - dj} = dA_jdF_{dj - di},}\\ {dA_iF_{di - j} = A_jdF_{j - di},\qquad (I_j = \mathrm{const}),}\\ {A_iF_{i - j} = A_jF_{j - i},\qquad (I_i,I_j = \mathrm{const}).} \end{array} \tag{4.15b}
$$

The different levels of view factors may be related to one another by

$$
\begin{array}{l}{F_{di - j} = \int_{A_j}dF_{di - dj},}\\ {F_{i - j} = \frac{1}{A_i}\int_{A_i}F_{di - j}dA_i.} \end{array} \tag{4.16b}
$$

If the receiving surface consists of a number of subsurfaces, we also have

$$
F_{i - j} = \sum_{k = 1}^{K}F_{i - (j,k)},\mathrm{with}A_{j} = \sum_{k = 1}^{K}A_{(j,k)}. \tag{4.17}
$$

Finally, an enclosure consisting of  $N$  surfaces, each with constant outgoing intensities, obeys the summation relation,

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}F_{di - j} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}F_{i - j} = 1. \tag{4.18}
$$

The last two relations follow directly from the definition of the view factor (i.e., the sum of all fractions must add up to unity). Note that equation (4.18) includes the view factor  $F_{i - i}$ . If surface  $A_{i}$  is flat or convex, no radiation leaving it will strike itself directly, and  $F_{i - i}$  simply vanishes. However, if  $A_{i}$  is concave, part of the radiation leaving it will be intercepted by itself and  $F_{i - i} > 0$ .

# 4.3 METHODS FOR THE EVALUATION OF VIEW FACTORS

The calculation of a radiative view factor between any two finite surfaces requires the solution to a double area integral, or a fourth- order integration. Such integrals are exceedingly difficult to evaluate analytically except for very simple geometries. Even numerical quadrature may often be problematic because of singularities in the integrand, and because of excessive CPU time requirements. Therefore, considerable effort has been directed toward tabulation and the development of evaluation methods for view factors. Early tables and charts for simple configurations were given by Hamilton and Morgan [1], Leuenberger and Pearson [2], and Kreith [3]. Fairly extensive tabulations were given in the books by Sparrow and Cess [4] and Siegel and Howell [5]. Siegel and Howell also give an exhaustive listing of sources for more involved view factors. The most complete tabulation is given in a catalogue by Howell [6,7], the latest version of which can also be accessed on the Internet via http://www.engr.uky.edu/rtl/Catalog/. A number of commercial and noncommercial computer programs for their evaluation are also available [8- 18], and a review of available numerical methods has been given by Emery and coworkers [19]. Some experimental methods have been discussed by Jakob [20] and Liu and Howell [21]. Within the present book Appendix D gives view factor formulae for an extensive set of geometries. Self- contained Fortran/C++/Matlab® programs viewfactors are included in Appendix F for the evaluation of all view factors listed in Appendix D [these programs call a function view, which may also be used from within other programs].

Radiation view factors may be determined by a variety of methods. One possible grouping of different approaches could be:

1. Direct integration:

(i) analytical or numerical integration of the relations given in the previous section (surface integration); (ii) conversion of the relations to contour integrals, followed by analytical or numerical integration (contour integration).

2. Statistical determination: View factors may be determined through statistical sampling with the Monte Carlo method.

3. Special methods: For many simple shapes integration can be avoided by employing one of the following special methods:

(i) view factor algebra, i.e., repeated application of the rules of reciprocity and the summation relationship;

![](images/19251ec9605fb545f4e5bcd7a668a5162857232224c5fa6e212da145dd58fa5f.jpg)  
FIGURE 4-6 Unit normal and direction cosines for a surface element.

(ii) crossed- strings method: a simple method for evaluation of view factors in two- dimensional geometries; (iii) unit sphere method: a powerful method for view factors between one infinitesimal and one finite area; (iv) inside sphere method: a simple method for a few special shapes.

All of the above methods will be discussed in the following pages, except for the Monte Carlo method, which is treated in considerable detail in Chapter 8.

# 4.4 AREA INTEGRATION

To evaluate equation (4.5) or to carry out the integrations in equations (4.8) and (4.13) the integrand (i.e.,  $\cos \theta_{i}, \cos \theta_{j},$  and  $S$ ) must be known in terms of a local coordinate system that describes the geometry of the two surfaces. While the evaluation of the integrand may be straightforward for some simple configurations, it is desirable to have a more generally applicable formula at one's disposal. Using an arbitrary coordinate origin, a vector pointing from the origin to a point on a surface may be written as

$$
\mathbf{r} = x\hat{\mathbf{r}} +y\hat{\mathbf{r}} +z\hat{\mathbf{k}}, \tag{4.19}
$$

where  $\hat{\mathbf{r}}, \hat{\mathbf{r}}$ , and  $\hat{\mathbf{k}}$  are unit vectors pointing into the  $x - , y - ,$  and  $z$ - directions, respectively. Thus the vector from  $dA_{i}$  going to  $dA_{j}$  is determined (see Fig. 4- 5) as

$$
\mathbf{s}_{ij} = -\mathbf{s}_{ji} = \mathbf{r}_j - \mathbf{r}_i = (x_j - x_i)\hat{\mathbf{r}} +(y_j - y_i)\hat{\mathbf{j}} +(z_j - z_i)\hat{\mathbf{k}}. \tag{4.20}
$$

The length of this vector is determined as

$$
|\mathbf{s}_{ij}|^2 = |\mathbf{s}_{ii}|^2 = S^2 = (x_j - x_i)^2 +(y_j - y_i)^2 +(z_j - z_i)^2. \tag{4.21}
$$

We will now assume that the local surface normals are also known in terms of the unit vectors  $\hat{\mathbf{r}}, \hat{\mathbf{r}}$ , and  $\hat{\mathbf{k}}$ , or, from Fig. 4- 6,

$$
\hat{\mathbf{n}} = l\hat{\mathbf{1}} +m\hat{\mathbf{j}} +n\hat{\mathbf{k}}, \tag{4.22}
$$

where  $l, m,$  and  $n$  are the direction cosines for the unit vector  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ , i.e.,  $l = \hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{1}} = \cos \theta_{x}$  is the cosine of the angle  $\theta_{x}$  between  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$  and the  $x$ - axis, etc. We may now evaluate  $\cos \theta_{i}$  and  $\cos \theta_{j}$  as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\cos \theta_{i} = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{s}_{ij}}{S} = \frac{1}{S}\left[(x_{j} - x_{i})l_{i} + (y_{j} - y_{i})m_{i} + (z_{j} - z_{i})n_{i}\right],\\ \cos \theta_{j} = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\mathbf{s}_{ji}}{S} = \frac{1}{S}\left[(x_{i} - x_{j})l_{j} + (y_{i} - y_{j})m_{j} + (z_{i} - z_{j})n_{j}\right]. \end{array} \tag{4.23b}
$$

FIGURE 4-7 View factor for strips on an infinitely long groove.

Example 4.1. Consider the infinitely long  $(- \infty < y < +\infty)$  wedge- shaped groove as shown in Fig. 4- 7. The groove has sides of widths  $a$  and  $b$  and an opening angle  $\alpha$ . Determine the view factor between the narrow strips shown in the figure.

# Solution

After placing the coordinate system as shown in the figure, we find  $z_{1} = 0, x_{2} = u_{2} \cos \alpha$ , and  $z_{2} = u_{2} \sin \alpha$ , leading to

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & S^{2} = (x_{1} - u_{2}\cos \alpha)^{2} + (y_{1} - y_{2})^{2} + u_{2}^{2}\sin^{2}\alpha \\ & \qquad = (x_{1}^{2} - 2x_{1}u_{2}\cos \alpha +u_{2}^{2}) + (y_{1} - y_{2})^{2} = S_{0}^{2} + (y_{1} - y_{2})^{2}, \end{array}
$$

where  $S_{0}$  is the projection of  $S$  in the  $x - z$ - plane and is constant in the present problem. The two surface normals are readily determined as

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1 = \hat{\mathbf{k}},\quad \mathrm{or}\quad l_1 = m_1 = 0,\quad n_1 = 1,}\\ & {\hat{\mathbf{n}}_2 = \hat{\mathbf{i}}\sin \alpha -\hat{\mathbf{k}}\cos \alpha ,\quad \mathrm{or}\quad l_2 = \sin \alpha ,m_2 = 0,n_2 = -\cos \alpha ,} \end{array}
$$

leading to

$$
\begin{array}{l}\cos \theta_1 = u_2\sin \alpha /S,\\ \cos \theta_2 = [(x_1 - u_2\cos \alpha)\sin \alpha +u_2\sin \alpha \cos \alpha ] / S = x_1\sin \alpha /S. \end{array}
$$

For illustrative purposes we will first calculate  $dF_{d1 - \mathrm{strip}2}$  from equation (4.8), and then  $dF_{\mathrm{strip1 - strip2}}$  from equation (4.16). Thus

$$
\begin{array}{l}{dF_{d1 - \mathrm{strip}2} = \int_{\partial A_{d1,\mathrm{strip}2}}\frac{\cos\theta_1\cos\theta_2}{\pi S_0^2} dA_2 = \frac{du_2}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{x_1u_2\sin^2\alpha dy_2}{\left[S_0^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2\right]^2}}\\ {= \frac{x_1u_2\sin^2\alpha du_2}{\pi}\left[\frac{y_2 - y_1}{2S_0^2\left[S_0^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2\right]} +\frac{1}{2S_0^3}\tan^{-1}\frac{y_2 - y_1}{S_0}\right]_{-\infty}^{+\infty}}\\ {= \frac{x_1u_2\sin^2\alpha du_2}{2S_0^3} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{u_2\sin\alpha}{S_0}\frac{x_1\sin\alpha}{S_0}\frac{du_2}{S_0} = \frac{1}{2}\cos \theta_{10}\cos \theta_{20}\frac{du_2}{S_0},} \end{array}
$$

where  $\theta_{10}$  and  $\theta_{20}$  are the projections of  $\theta_{1}$  and  $\theta_{2}$  in the  $x - z$ - plane. Looking at Fig. 4- 8 this may be rewritten as

$$
\begin{array}{r}dF_{d1 - \mathrm{strip}2} = \frac{1}{2}\cos \phi d\phi , \end{array}
$$

FIGURE 4-8 Two-dimensional wedge-shaped groove with projected distances.

where  $\phi = \theta_{10}$  is the off- normal angle at which  $dA_{\mathrm{strip2}}$  is oriented from  $dA_{\mathrm{strip1}}$ . We note that  $dF_{d1 - \mathrm{strip2}}$  does not depend on  $y_{1}$ . No matter where on strip 1 an observer is standing, he sees the same strip 2 extending from  $- \infty$  to  $+\infty$ . It remains to calculate  $dF_{\mathrm{strip1 - strip2}}$  from equation (4.16). Since equation (4.16) simply takes an average, and since  $dF_{d1 - \mathrm{strip2}}$  does not vary along  $dA_{\mathrm{strip2}}$ , it follows immediately that

$$
dF_{\mathrm{strip1 - strip2}} = \frac{1}{2}\cos \phi d\phi = \frac{x_1\sin^2\alpha u_2du_2}{2S_0^3}.
$$

Example 4.2. Determine the view factor  $F_{1 - 2}$  for the infinitely long groove shown in Fig. 4- 8.

# Solution

Since we already know the view factor between two infinite strips, we can write

$$
\begin{array}{l}{F_{\mathrm{strip1 - 2}} = \int_0^b dF_{\mathrm{strip1 - strip2}},}\\ {F_{1 - 2} = \frac{1}{a}\int_0^a F_{\mathrm{strip1 - 2}}dx_1.} \end{array}
$$

Therefore, from Example 4.1,

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{F_{\mathrm{strip1 - 2}} =} & {\frac{x_{1}\sin^{2}\alpha}{2}\int_{0}^{b}\frac{u_{2}d u_{2}}{(x_{1}^{2} - 2x_{1}u_{2}\cos\alpha + u_{2}^{2})^{3 / 2}} = \frac{x_{1}\sin^{2}\alpha}{2}\frac{x_{1}\cos\alpha u_{2} - x_{1}^{2}}{x_{1}^{2}\sin^{2}\alpha\sqrt{1 - 2x_{1}u_{2}\cos\alpha + u_{2}^{2}}}\Bigg|_{0}^{b}}\\ & {= \frac{1}{2}\Bigg(1 + \frac{b\cos\alpha - x_{1}}{\sqrt{x_{1}^{2} - 2b x_{1}\cos\alpha + b^{2}}}\Bigg).} \end{array}
$$

Finally, carrying out the second integration we obtain

$$
F_{1 - 2} = \frac{1}{a}\int_{0}^{a}F_{\mathrm{strip1 - 2}}dx_{1} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{1}{a}\sqrt{x_{1}^{2} - 2bx_{1}\cos\alpha + b^{2}}\bigg|_{0}^{a}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \frac{b}{a} -\sqrt{1 - 2\frac{b}{a}\cos\alpha + \left(\frac{b}{a}\right)^{2}}\right).
$$

Example 4.3. As a final example for area integration we shall consider the view factor between two parallel, coaxial disks of radius  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$ , respectively, as shown in Fig. 4- 9.

# Solution

Placing  $x$ ,  $y$ , and  $z$ - axes as shown in the figure, and making a coordinate transformation to cylindrical

![](images/c354ac0bf483f2033ab388c96219e740bee629bb1ff15a0f7043561f10fb16e5.jpg)  
FIGURE 4-9 Coordinate systems for the view factor between parallel, coaxial disks.

coordinates, we find

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & x_{1} = r_{1}\cos \psi_{1},y_{1} = r_{1}\sin \psi_{1},z_{1} = 0;dA_{1} = r_{1}dr_{1}d\psi_{1};\\ & x_{2} = r_{2}\cos \psi_{2},y_{2} = r_{2}\sin \psi_{2},z_{2} = h;dA_{2} = r_{2}dr_{2}d\psi_{2};\\ & S^{2} = (r_{1}\cos \psi_{1} - r_{2}\cos \psi_{2})^{2} + (r_{1}\sin \psi_{1} - r_{2}\sin \psi_{2})^{2} + h^{2}\\ & = h^{2} + r_{1}^{2} + r_{2}^{2} - 2r_{1}r_{2}\cos (\psi_{1} - \psi_{2}). \end{array}
$$

Since  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1 = \hat{\mathbf{k}}$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}_2 = - \hat{\mathbf{k}}$ , we also find  $l_{1} = l_{2} = m_{1} = m_{2} = 0$ ,  $n_1 = - n_2 = 1$ , and from equation (4.23)  $\cos \theta_{1} = \cos \theta_{2} = \hbar /3$ . Thus, from equation (4.13)

$$
F_{1 - 2} = \frac{1}{(\pi R_1)^{\pi}}\int_{r_1 = 0}^{R_1}\int_{r_2 = 0}^{R_2}\int_{\psi_1 = 0}^{2\pi}\int_{\psi_2 = 0}^{2\pi}\frac{h^2r_1r_2d\psi_2d\psi_1dr_2dr_1}{\left[h^2 + r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2r_1r_2\cos(\psi_1 - \psi_2)\right]^2}.
$$

Changing the dummy variable  $\psi_{2}$  to  $\psi = \psi_{1} - \psi_{2}$  makes the integrand independent of  $\psi_{1}$  (integrating from  $\psi_{1} - 2\pi$  to  $\psi_{1}$  is the same as integrating from 0 to  $2\pi$ , since integration is over a full period), so that the  $\psi_{1}$ - integration may be carried out immediately:

$$
F_{1 - 2} = \frac{2h^2}{\pi R_1^2}\int_{r_1 = 0}^{R_1}\int_{r_2 = 0}^{R_2}\int_{\psi = 0}^{2\pi}\frac{r_1r_2d\psi dr_2dr_1}{(h^2 + r_1^2 + r_2^2 - 2r_1r_2\cos\psi)^2}.
$$

This result can also be obtained by physical argument, since the view factor from any pie slice of  $A_{1}$  must be the same (and equal to the one from the entire disk). While a second integration (over  $r_1$ ,  $r_2$ , or  $\psi$ ) can be carried out, analytical evaluation of the remaining two integrals appears bleak. We shall abandon the problem here in the hope of finding another method with which we can evaluate  $F_{1 - 2}$  more easily.

# 4.5 CONTOUR INTEGRATION

According to Stokes' theorem, as developed in standard mathematics texts such as Wylie [22], a surface integral may be converted to an equivalent contour integral (see Fig. 4- 10) through

$$
\oint_{\Gamma}\mathbf{f}\cdot d\mathbf{s} = \int_{A}(\nabla \times \mathbf{f})\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} dA, \tag{4.24}
$$

where  $\mathbf{f}$  is a vector function defined everywhere on the surface  $A$ , including its boundary  $\Gamma$ ,  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$  is the unit surface normal, and  $\mathbf{s}$  is the position vector for a point on the boundary of  $A$  ( $d\mathbf{s}$ , therefore, is the vector describing the boundary contour of  $A$ ). By convention the contour integration in

![](images/2ff55e8ee66beda47d7ff444259449f03800f0b61edaf70ada7c51b5ea8fd75d.jpg)  
FIGURE 4-10 Conversion between surface and contour integral; Stokes' theorem.

equation (4.24) is carried out in the counterclockwise sense for an observer standing atop the surface (i.e., on the side from which the normal points up).

If a vector function  $\mathbf{f}$  that makes the integrand of equation (4.24) equivalent to the one of equation (4.8) can be identified, then the area (or double) integral of equation (4.8) can be reduced to a contour (or single) integral. Applying Stokes' theorem twice, the double area integration of equation (4.13) could be converted to a double line integral. Contour integration was first applied to radiative view factor calculations (in the field of illumination engineering) by Moon [23]. The earliest applications to radiative heat transfer appear to have been by de Bastos [24] and Sparrow [25].

# View Factors from Differential Elements to Finite Areas

For this case the vector function  $\mathbf{f}$  may be identified as

$$
\mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{\mathbf{s}_{12}\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1}{S^2}, \tag{4.25}
$$

leading to

$$
F_{d1 - 2} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\oint_{\Gamma_2}\frac{(\mathbf{s}_{12}\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1)\cdot d\mathbf{s}_2}{S^2}, \tag{4.26}
$$

where  $\mathbf{s}_{12}$  is the vector pointing from  $dA_{1}$  to a point on the contour of  $A_{2}$  (described by vector  $\mathbf{s}_{2}$ ), while  $d\mathbf{s}_{2}$  points along the contour of  $A_{2}$ .

For the interested reader with some background in vector calculus we shall briefly prove that equation (4.26) is equivalent to equation (4.8). Using the identity (given, e.g., by Wylie [22]),

$$
\mathbf{V}\times (\phi \mathbf{a}) = \phi \mathbf{V}\times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a}\times \mathbf{V}\phi , \tag{4.27}
$$

we may write

$$
2\pi \nabla_{2}\times \mathbf{f} = \nabla_{2}\times \left(\frac{\mathbf{s}_{12}\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1}}{S^{2}}\right) = \frac{1}{S^{2}}\nabla_{2}\times (\mathbf{s}_{12}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1}) - (\mathbf{s}_{12}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1})\times \nabla_{2}\left(\frac{1}{S^{2}}\right). \tag{4.28}
$$

From equations (4.20) and (4.21) it follows that

$$
\nabla_{2}\left(\frac{1}{S^{2}}\right) = -\frac{2}{S^{3}}\nabla_{2}S = -\frac{2}{S^{3}}\frac{\mathbf{s}_{12}}{S} = -\frac{2\mathbf{s}_{12}}{S^{4}}.
$$

We also find, using standard vector identities,

$$
\begin{array}{r}(\mathbf{s}_{12}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}}_1)\times \mathbf{s}_{12} = \hat{\mathbf{n}}_1(\mathbf{s}_{12}\cdot \mathbf{s}_{12}) - \mathbf{s}_{12}(\mathbf{s}_{12}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_1) = S^2\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1 - \mathbf{s}_{12}(\mathbf{s}_{12}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_1),\\ \nabla_2\times (\mathbf{s}_{12}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}}_1) = \hat{\mathbf{n}}_1\cdot \nabla_2\mathbf{s}_{12} - \mathbf{s}_{12}\cdot \nabla_2\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1 + \mathbf{s}_{12}\nabla_2\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_1 - \hat{\mathbf{n}}_1\nabla_2\cdot \mathbf{s}_{12}. \end{array} \tag{4.29b}
$$

In the last expression the terms  $\nabla_2\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1$  and  $\nabla_2\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_1$  drop out since  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1$  is independent of surface  $A_{2}$ . Also, from equation (4.20) we find

$$
\nabla_{2}\cdot \mathbf{s}_{12} = 3,\quad \nabla_{2}\mathbf{s}_{12} = \hat{\mathbf{n}} +\hat{\mathbf{y}}\hat{\mathbf{j}} +\hat{\mathbf{k}}\hat{\mathbf{k}} = \delta , \tag{4.30}
$$

where  $\delta$  is the unit tensor whose diagonal elements are unity and whose nondiagonal elements are zero:

$$
\delta = \left( \begin{array}{lll}1 & 0 & 0\\ & & \\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ & & \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right). \tag{4.31}
$$

With  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1\cdot \delta = \hat{\mathbf{n}}_1$  equation (4.29b) reduces to

$$
\nabla_{2}\times (\mathbf{s}_{12}\times \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1}) = \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1} - 3\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1} = -2\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1}.
$$

Substituting all this into equation (4.28), we obtain

$$
2\pi \nabla_{2}\times \mathbf{f} = -\frac{2\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1}}{S^{2}} +\frac{2}{S^{4}}\left[S^{2}\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1} - \mathbf{s}_{12}(\mathbf{s}_{12}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1})\right] = -\frac{2}{S^{4}}\mathbf{s}_{12}(\mathbf{s}_{12}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1}),
$$

and

$$
(\nabla_{2}\times \mathbf{f})\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{2} = -\frac{(\mathbf{s}_{12}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1})(\mathbf{s}_{12}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{2})}{\pi S^{4}} = \frac{\cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2}}{\pi S^{2}}. \tag{4.32}
$$

Together with Stokes' theorem this completes the proof that equation (4.26) is equivalent to an area integral over the function given by equation (4.32).

For a Cartesian coordinate system, using equations (4.19) through (4.22), we have

$$
ds_{2} = dx_{2}\hat{\mathbf{1}} +dy_{2}\hat{\mathbf{j}} +dz_{2}\hat{\mathbf{k}},
$$

and equation (4.26) becomes

$$
\begin{array}{l}{F_{d1 - 2} = \frac{l_1}{2\pi}\oint_{\Gamma_2}\frac{(z_2 - z_1)dy_2 - (y_2 - y_1)dz_2}{S^2} +\frac{m_1}{2\pi}\oint_{\Gamma_2}\frac{(x_2 - x_1)dz_2 - (z_2 - z_1)dx_2}{S^2}}\\ {+\frac{n_1}{2\pi}\oint_{\Gamma_2}\frac{(y_2 - y_1)dx_2 - (x_2 - x_1)dy_2}{S^2}.} \end{array} \tag{4.33}
$$

Example 4.4. Determine the view factor  $F_{d1 - 2}$  for the configuration shown in Fig. 4- 11.

# Solution

With the coordinate system as shown in the figure we have

$$
S = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + c^2},
$$

and, with  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1 = - \hat{\mathbf{k}}$ , or  $l_1 = n_1 = 0$  and  $n_1 = - 1$ , it follows that equation (4.33) reduces to

$$

# View Factors between Finite Areas

To reduce the order of integration for the determination of the view factor between two finite surfaces  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$ , Stokes' theorem may be applied twice, leading to

$$
A_{1}F_{1 - 2} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \oint_{\Gamma_{1}} \oint_{\Gamma_{2}} \ln S d\mathbf{s}_{2} \cdot d\mathbf{s}_{1}, \tag{4.34}
$$

where the contours of the two surfaces are described by the two vectors  $\mathbf{s}_{1}$  and  $\mathbf{s}_{2}$ . To prove that equation (4.34) is equivalent to equation (4.13) we get, comparing with equation (4.24) (for surface  $A_{1}$ ),

$$
\mathbf{f} = \frac{1}{2\pi} \oint_{\Gamma_{2}} \ln S d\mathbf{s}_{2}. \tag{4.35}
$$

Taking the curl leads, by means of equation (4.27), to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{2\pi \nabla_{1}\times \mathbf{f} = \oint_{\Gamma_{2}}\nabla_{1}\times (\ln S d\mathbf{s}_{2}) = \oint_{\Gamma_{2}}\nabla_{1}(\ln S)\times d\mathbf{s}_{2}}\\ {= \oint_{\Gamma_{2}}\frac{1}{S}\nabla_{1}S\times d\mathbf{s}_{2},} \end{array} \tag{4.36}
$$

where differentiation is with respect to the coordinates of surface  $A_{1}$  (for which Stokes' theorem has been applied). Forming the dot product with  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1}$  then results in

$$
\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1\cdot (\nabla_1\times \mathbf{f}) = \oint_{\Gamma_2}\frac{1}{2\pi S}\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1\cdot (\nabla_1S\times d\mathbf{s}_2) = \oint_{\Gamma_2}\frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1\times\nabla_1S}{2\pi S}\cdot d\mathbf{s}_2, \tag{4.37}
$$

where use has been made of the vector relationship

$$
\mathbf{u}\cdot (\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{w}) = (\mathbf{u}\times \mathbf{v})\cdot \mathbf{w}. \tag{4.38}
$$

Again, from equations (4.20) and (4.21) it follows that  $\nabla_{1}S = - \mathbf{s}_{12} / S$ , so that

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1\cdot (\nabla_1\times \mathbf{f}) = -\oint_{\Gamma_2}\frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1\times\mathbf{s}_{12}}{2\pi S^2}\cdot d\mathbf{s}_2 = \oint_{\Gamma_2}\frac{\mathbf{s}_{12}\times\hat{\mathbf{n}}_1}{2\pi S^2}\cdot d\mathbf{s}_2}\\ {= F_{d1 - 2} = \int_{A_2}\frac{\cos\theta_1\cos\theta_2}{\pi S^2} dA_2,} \end{array}
$$

where equation (4.26) has been employed. Finally,

$$
A_{1}F_{1 - 2} = \int_{A_{1}}\hat{\mathbf{n}}_{1}\cdot (\nabla_{1}\times \mathbf{f})dA_{1} = \int_{A_{1}}\int_{A_{2}}\frac{\cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2}}{\pi S^{2}} dA_{2}dA_{1}, \tag{4.39}
$$

which is, of course, identical to equation (4.13).

For Cartesian coordinates, with  $\mathbf{s}_1$  and  $\mathbf{s}_2$  from equation (4.19), equation (4.34) becomes

$$
A_{1}F_{1 - 2} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\oint_{\Gamma_{1}}\oint_{\Gamma_{2}}\ln S(dx_{2}dx_{1} + dy_{2}dy_{1} + dz_{2}dz_{1}). \tag{4.40}
$$

Example 4.5. Determine the view factor between two parallel, coaxial disks, Example 4.3, by contour integration.

# Solution

With  $d\mathbf{s} = dx\hat{\mathbf{1}} +dy\hat{\mathbf{1}} +dz\hat{\mathbf{k}}$  it follows immediately from the coordinates given in Example 4.3 that

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{d\mathbf{s}_1} & {= R_1d\psi_1(-\sin \psi_1\hat{\mathbf{1}} +\cos \psi_1\hat{\mathbf{1}}),}\\ {d\mathbf{s}_2} & {= R_2d\psi_2(-\sin \psi_2\hat{\mathbf{1}} +\cos \psi_2\hat{\mathbf{1}}),}\\ {d\mathbf{s}_1\cdot d\mathbf{s}_2} & {= R_1R_2d\psi_1d\psi_2(\sin \psi_1\sin \psi_2 + \cos \psi_1\cos \psi_2)}\\ & {= R_1R_2\cos (\psi_1 - \psi_2)d\psi_1d\psi_2,} \end{array}
$$

where, it should be remembered,  $d\mathbf{s}$  is along the periphery of a disk, i.e., at  $r = R$ . Substituting the last expression into equation (4.34) leads to

$$
F_{1 - 2} = \frac{R_1R_2}{2\pi(\pi R_1^2)}\int_{\psi = 0}^{2\pi}\int_{\psi = 0}^{-2\pi}\ln \left[h^2 +R_1^2 +R_2^2 -2R_1R_2\cos (\psi_1 - \psi_2)\right]^{1 / 2}\cos (\psi_1 - \psi_2)d\psi_2d\psi_1,
$$

where the integration for  $\psi_{2}$  is from 0 to  $- 2\pi$  since, for an observer standing on top of  $A_{2}$ , the integration must be in a counterclockwise sense. Just like in Example 4.3, we can eliminate one of the integrations immediately since the angles appear only as differences, i.e.,  $\psi_{1} - \psi_{2}$ .

$$
F_{1 - 2} = -\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{R_2}{R_1}\int_0^{2\pi}\ln \left(h^2 +R_1^2 +R_2^2 -2R_1R_2\cos \psi\right)^{1 / 2}\cos \psi d\psi .
$$

Integrating by parts we obtain:

$$
\begin{array}{l}{F_{1 - 2} = -\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{R_2}{R_1}[\sin \psi \ln (h^2 +R_1^2 +R_2^2 -2R_1R_2\cos \psi)^{1 / 2}]_0^{2\pi} - R_1R_2\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\sin^2\psi d\psi}{h^2 + R_1^2 + R_2^2 - 2R_1R_2\cos\psi}]}\\ {= \frac{R_2 / R_1}{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{\sin^2\psi d\psi}{X - \cos\psi},} \end{array}
$$

where we have introduced the abbreviation

$$
X = \frac{h^2 + R_1^2 + R_2^2}{2R_1R_2}.
$$

The integral can be found in better integral tables, or may be converted to a simpler form through trigonometric relations, leading to

$$
F_{1 - 2} = \frac{R_2 / R_1}{2\pi} 2\pi \left(X - \sqrt{X^2 - 1}\right) = \frac{R_2}{R_1}\left(X - \sqrt{X^2 - 1}\right).
$$

# 4.6 VIEW FACTOR ALGEBRA

Many view factors for fairly complex configurations may be calculated without any integration by simply using the rules of reciprocity and summation, and perhaps the known view factor for a more basic geometry. That is, besides one (or more) known view factor we will only use the following three basic equations:

Reciprocity Rule:

$$
A_{i}F_{i - j} = A_{j}F_{j - i}, \tag{4.15c}
$$

Summation Relation:

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}F_{i - j} = 1, \tag{4.18}
$$

Subsurface Summation  $A_{j} = \sum_{k = 1}^{K}A_{(j,k)}$ :

$$
F_{i - j} = \sum_{k = 1}^{K}F_{i - (j,k)}. \tag{4.17}
$$

We shall illustrate the usefulness of this view factor algebra through a few simple examples.

Example 4.6. Suppose we have been given the view factor for the configuration shown in Fig. 4- 11, that is,  $F_{d1 - 2} = F(a,b,c)$  as determined in Example 4.4. Determine the view factor  $F_{d1 - 3}$  for the configuration shown in Fig. 4- 12.

# Solution

To express  $F_{d1 - 3}$  in terms of known view factors  $F(a,b,c)$  (with the differential area opposite one of the corners of the large plate), we fill the plane of  $A_{3}$  with hypothetical surfaces  $A_{4},A_{5},$  and  $A_{6}$  as indicated in Fig. 4- 12. From the definition of view factors, or equation (4.13), it follows that

$$
\begin{array}{c}{F_{d1 - (3 + 4 + 5 + 6)} = F_{d1 - 3} + F_{d1 - 4} + F_{d1 - (5 + 6)},}\\ {F_{d1 - 4} = F_{d1 - (4 + 6)} - F_{d1 - 6}.} \end{array}
$$

Thus,

$$
F_{d1 - 3} = F_{d1 - (3 + 4 + 5 + 6)} - F_{d1 - (4 + 6)} + F_{d1 - 6} - F_{d1 - (5 + 6)}.
$$

FIGURE 4-13 Configuration for Example 4.7: (a) full corner piece, (b) strips on a corner piece.

All four of these are of the type discussed in Example 4.4. Therefore,

$$
F_{d1 - 3} = F(a + b,c + d,e) - F(a,c + d,e) + F(a,c,e) - F(a + b,c,e).
$$

We have successfully converted the present complex view factor to a summation of four known, more basic ones.

Example 4.7. Assuming the view factor for a finite corner, as shown in Fig. 4- 13a, is known as  $F_{1 - 2} = f(a,b,c)$ , where  $f$  is a known function of the dimensions of the corner pieces (as given in Appendix D), determine the view factor  $F_{3 - 4}$ , between the two perpendicular strips as shown in Fig. 4- 13b.

# Solution

From the definition of the view factor, and since the energy traveling to  $A_{4}$  is the energy going to  $A_{2}$  plus  $A_{4}$  minus the energy going to  $A_{2}$ , it follows that

$$
F_{3 - 4} = F_{3 - (2 + 4)} - F_{3 - 2},
$$

and, using reciprocity,

$$
F_{3 - 4} = \frac{1}{A_3}\left[(A_2 + A_4)F_{(2 + 4) - 3} - A_2F_{2 - 3}\right].
$$

Similarly, we find

$$
F_{3 - 4} = \frac{A_2 + A_4}{A_3}\left(F_{(2 + 4) - (1 + 3)} - F_{(2 + 4) - 1}\right) - \frac{A_2}{A_3}\left(F_{2 - (1 + 3)} - F_{2 - 1}\right).
$$

All view factors on the right- hand side are corner pieces and are, thus, known by evaluating the function  $f$  with appropriate dimensions.

Example 4.8. Again, assuming the view factor is known for the configuration in Fig. 4- 13a, determine  $F_{1 - 6}$  as shown in Fig. 4- 14.

# Solution

Examining Fig. 4- 14, and employing reciprocity, we find

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {(A_5 + A_6)F_{(5 + 6) - (1 + 2)} = (A_5 + A_6)\big(F_{(5 + 6) - 1} + F_{(5 + 6) - 2}\big)}\\ & {\qquad = A_1(F_{1 - 5} + F_{1 - 6}) + A_2(F_{2 - 5} + F_{2 - 6})}\\ & {\qquad = A_1\big(F_{1 - (3 + 5)} - F_{1 - 3}\big) + A_2\big(F_{2 - (4 + 6)} - F_{2 - 4}\big) + A_1F_{1 - 6} + A_2F_{2 - 5}.} \end{array}
$$

On the other hand, we also have

$$
\begin{array}{r}(A_5 + A_6)F_{(5 + 6) - (1 + 2)} = (A_1 + A_2)\big(F_{(1 + 2) - (3 + 4 + 5 + 6)} - F_{(1 + 2) - (3 + 4)}\big). \end{array}
$$

FIGURE 4-14 Configuration for Example 4.8.

In both expressions all view factors, with the exceptions of  $F_{1 - 6}$  and  $F_{2 - 5}$ , are of the type given in Fig. 4- 13a.

These last two view factors may be related to one another, as is easily seen from their integral forms. From equation (4.13) we have

$$
A_{2}F_{2 - 5} = \int_{A_{2}}\int_{A_{5}}\frac{\cos\theta_{2}\cos\theta_{5}}{\pi S^{2}} dA_{5}dA_{2}.
$$

With a coordinate system as shown in Fig. 4- 14, we get from equations (4.21) and (4.23)  $S^{2} = x_{2}^{2} + (y_{2} - y_{5})^{2} + z_{5}^{2}$ ,  $\cos \theta_{2} = z_{5} / S$ ,  $\cos \theta_{5} = x_{2} / S$ , or

$$
A_{2}F_{2 - 5} = \int_{x_{2} = 0}^{e}\int_{y_{2} = d}^{b}\int_{y_{5} = 0}^{a}\int_{z_{5} = c}^{d}\frac{x_{2}z_{5}dz_{5}dy_{5}dy_{2}dx_{2}}{\pi[x_{2}^{2} + (y_{2} - y_{5})^{2} + y_{5}^{2}^{2}]}.
$$

Similarly, we obtain for  $F_{1 - 6}$

$$
A_{1}F_{1 - 6} = \int_{x_{1} = 0}^{e}\int_{y_{1} = 0}^{a}\int_{y_{6} = d}^{b}\int_{z_{6} = c}^{d}\frac{x_{1}z_{6}dz_{6}dy_{6}dy_{1}dx_{1}}{\pi[x_{1}^{2} + (y_{1} - y_{6})^{2} + y_{6}^{2}]^{2}}.
$$

Switching the names for dummy integration variables, it is obvious that

$$
A_{2}F_{2 - 5} = A_{1}F_{1 - 6},
$$

which may be called the law of reciprocity for diagonally opposed pairs of perpendicular rectangular plates. Finally, solving for  $F_{1 - 6}$  we obtain

$$
F_{1 - 6} = \frac{A_1 + A_2}{2A_1}\left(F_{(1 + 2) - (3 + 4 + 5 + 6)} - F_{(1 + 2) - (3 + 4)}\right) - \frac{1}{2}\left(F_{1 - (3 + 5)} - F_{1 - 3}\right) - \frac{x_1}{2A_1}\left(F_{2 - (4 + 6)} - F_{2 - 4}\right).
$$

Using similar arguments, one may also determine the view factor between two arbitrarily orientated rectangular plates lying in perpendicular planes (Fig. 4- 15a) or in parallel planes (Fig. 4- 15b). After considerable algebra, one finds [1]:

Perpendicular plates (Fig. 4- 15a):

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & 2A_{1}F_{1 - 2} = f(x_{2},y_{2},z_{3}) - f(x_{2},y_{1},z_{3}) - f(x_{1},y_{2},z_{3}) + f(x_{1},y_{1},z_{3})\\ & \qquad +f(x_{1},y_{2},z_{2}) - f(x_{1},y_{1},z_{2}) - f(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2}) + f(x_{2},y_{1},z_{2})\\ & \qquad -f(x_{2},y_{2},z_{3} - z_{1}) + f(x_{2},y_{1},z_{3} - z_{1}) + f(x_{1},y_{2},z_{3} - z_{1}) - f(x_{1},y_{1},z_{3} - z_{1})\\ & \qquad +f(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2} - z_{1}) - f(x_{2},y_{1},z_{2} - z_{1}) - f(x_{1},y_{2},z_{2} - z_{1}) + f(x_{1},y_{1},z_{2} - z_{1}), \end{array} \tag{4.41}
$$

$$

where  $f(a,b) = A_{1}F_{1 - 2}$  is the product of area and view factor between two directly opposed, parallel rectangles, as given by Configuration 38 in Appendix D.

Equations (4.41) and (4.42) are not restricted to  $x_{3} > x_{2} > x_{1},$  and so on, but hold for arbitrary values, for example, they are valid for partially overlapping surfaces. Fortran functions perpplates and par1plates are included in Appendix F for the evaluation of these view factors, based on calls to Fortran function view (i.e., calls to function view to evaluate the various view factors for Configurations 39 and 38, respectively).

Example 4.9. Show that equation (4.42) reduces to the correct expression for directly opposing rectangles.

# Solution

For directly opposing rectangles, we have  $x_{1} = x_{3} = a,$ $y_{1} = y_{3} = b,$  and  $x_{2} = y_{2} = 0$  . We note that the formula for  $A_{1}F_{1 - 2}$  for Configuration 38 in Appendix D is such that  $f(a,b) = f(- a,b) = f(a, - b) = f(- a, - b),$  i.e., the view factor and area are both "negative" for a single negative dimension, making their product positive, and similarly if both  $a$  and  $b$  are negative. Also, if either  $a$  or  $b$  is zero (zero area), then  $f(a,b) = 0$  Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & 4A_1F_{1 - 2} = f(a,b) - 0 - 0 + f(a, - b) - [0 - 0 - 0 + 0]\\ & \qquad -[0 - 0 - 0 + 0] + f(-a,b) - 0 - 0 + f(-a, - b)\\ & \qquad = 4f(a,b). \end{array}
$$

Many other view factors for a multitude of configurations may be obtained through view factor algebra. A few more examples will be given in this and the following chapters (when radiative exchange between black, gray- diffuse, and gray- specular surfaces is discussed).

FIGURE 4-16 The crossed-strings method for arbitrary two-dimensional configurations.

# 4.7 THE CROSSED-STRINGS METHOD

View factor algebra may be used to determine all view factors in long enclosures with constant cross- section. The method is credited to Hottel [26],* and is called the crossed- strings method since the view factors can be determined experimentally by a person armed with four pins, a roll of string, and a yardstick. Consider the configuration in Fig. 4- 16, which shows the cross- section of an infinitely long enclosure, continuing into and out of the plane of the figure: We would like to determine  $F_{1 - 2}$ . Obviously, the surfaces shown are rather irregular (partly convex, partly concave), and the view between them may be obstructed. We shudder at the thought of having to carry out the view factor determination by integration, and plant our four pins at the two ends of each surface, as indicated by the labels  $a$ ,  $b$ ,  $c$ , and  $d$ . We now connect points  $a$  and  $c$  and  $b$  and  $d$  with tight strings, making sure that no visual obstruction remains between the two strings. Similarly, we place tight strings  $ab$  and  $cd$  across the surfaces, and  $ad$  and  $bc$  diagonally between them, as shown in Fig. 4- 16. Now assuming the strings to be imaginary surfaces  $A_{ab}$ ,  $A_{ac}$ , and  $A_{bc}$ , we apply the summation rule to the "triangle"  $abc$ :

$$
\begin{array}{r}A_{ab}F_{ab - ac} + A_{ab}F_{ab - bc} = A_{ab},\\ A_{ac}F_{ac - ab} + A_{ac}F_{ac - bc} = A_{ac},\\ A_{bc}F_{bc - ac} + A_{bc}F_{bc - ab} = A_{bc}, \end{array} \tag{4.43a}
$$

where  $F_{ab - ab} = F_{ac - ac} = F_{bc - bc} = 0$  since a tightened string will always form a convex surface. Equations (4.43) are three equations in six unknown view factors, which may be solved by applying reciprocity to three of them:

$$
\begin{array}{r}A_{ab}F_{ab - ac} + A_{ab}F_{ab - bc} = A_{ab},\\ A_{ab}F_{ab - ac} + A_{ac}F_{ac - bc} = A_{ac},\\ A_{ac}F_{ac - bc} + A_{ab}F_{ab - bc} = A_{bc}. \end{array} \tag{4.44b}
$$

Adding the first two equations and subtracting the last leads to the view factor for an arbitrarily shaped triangle with convex surfaces,

$$
F_{ab - ac} = \frac{A_{ab} + A_{ac} - A_{bc}}{2A_{ab}}, \tag{4.45}
$$

which states that the view factor between two surfaces in an arbitrary "triangle" is equal to the area of the originating surface, plus the area of the receiving surface, minus the area of the third surface, divided by twice the originating surface.

Applying equation (4.45) to triangle  $abd$  we find immediately

$$
F_{ab - bd} = \frac{A_{ab} + A_{bd} - A_{ad}}{2A_{ab}}. \tag{4.46}
$$

But, from the summation rule,

Thus

$$
\begin{array}{c}{F_{ab - ac} + F_{ab - bd} + F_{ab - cd} = 1.}\\ {}\\ {F_{ab - cd} = 1 - \frac{A_{ab} + A_{ac} - A_{bc}}{2A_{ab}} -\frac{A_{ab} + A_{bd} - A_{ad}}{2A_{ab}}}\\ {}\\ {= \frac{(A_{bc} + A_{ad}) - (A_{ac} + A_{bd})}{2A_{ab}}.} \end{array} \tag{4.47}
$$

Inspection of Fig. 4- 16 shows that all radiation leaving  $A_{ab}$  traveling to  $A_{cd}$  will hit surface  $A_{1}$ . At the same time all radiation from  $A_{ab}$  going to  $A_{1}$  must pass through  $A_{cd}$ . Therefore,

$$
F_{ab - cd} = F_{ab - 1}.
$$

Using reciprocity and repeating the argument for surfaces  $A_{ab}$  and  $A_{2}$ , we find

$$
F_{ab - cd} = F_{ab - 1} = \frac{A_1}{A_{ab}} F_{1 - ab} = \frac{A_1}{A_{ab}} F_{1 - 2},
$$

and, finally,

$$
F_{1 - 2} = \frac{(A_{bc} + A_{ad}) - (A_{ac} + A_{bd})}{2A_1}. \tag{4.49}
$$

This formula is easily memorized by looking at the configuration between any two surfaces as a generalized "rectangle," consisting of  $A_{1}, A_{2}$ , and the two sides  $A_{ac}$  and  $A_{bd}$ . Then

$$
F_{1 - 2} = \frac{\mathrm{diagonal - sides}}{2\times\mathrm{originalarea}}. \tag{4.50}
$$

Example 4.10. Calculate  $F_{1 - 2}$  for the configuration shown in Fig. 4- 17.

# Solution

From the figure it is obvious that

$$
s_1^2 = (c - d\cos \alpha)^2 +d^2\sin^2\alpha = c^2 +d^2 -2cd\cos \alpha .
$$

Similarly, we have

$$
\begin{array}{l}{s_2^2 = (a + c)^2 +(b + d)^2 -2(a + c)(b + d)\cos \alpha ,}\\ {d_1^2 = (a + c)^2 +d^2 -2(a + c)d\cos \alpha ,}\\ {d_2^2 = c^2 +(b + d)^2 -2c(b + d)\cos \alpha ,} \end{array}
$$

and

$$
F_{1 - 2} = \frac{d_1 + d_2 - (s_1 + s_2)}{2a}.
$$

FIGURE 4-17 Infinitely long wedge-shaped groove for Examples 4.10 and 4.11.

For  $c = d = 0$ , this reduces to the result of Example 4.2, or

$$
F_{1 - 2} = \frac{a + b - \sqrt{a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos\alpha}}{2a}.
$$

Example 4.11. Find the view factor  $F_{d1 - 2}$  of Fig. 4- 17 for the case that  $A_{1}$  is an infinitesimal strip of width  $dx$ . Use the crossed- strings method.

# Solution

We can obtain the result right away by replacing  $a$  by  $dx$  in the previous example. Throwing out differentials of second and higher order, we find that  $s_1$  and  $d_2$  remain unchanged, and

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}{d_1} & = & {\sqrt{(c + dx)^2 + d^2 - 2(c + dx)d\cos\alpha}}\\ {} & = & {\sqrt{c^2 + d^2 - 2cd\cos\alpha + 2(c - d\cos\alpha)dx}}\\ {} & \simeq & {\sqrt{c^2 + d^2 - 2cd\cos\alpha}\left[1 + \frac{(c - d\cos\alpha)dx}{c^2 + d^2 - 2cd\cos\alpha}\right] = s_1 + \frac{dx}{s_1} (c - d\cos \alpha)}\\ {} & {} & {}\\ {s_2} & = & {\sqrt{(c + dx)^2 + (b + d)^2 - 2(c + dx)(b + d)\cos\alpha}}\\ {} & \simeq & {d_2 + \frac{dx}{d_2} [c - (b + d)\cos \alpha ].} \end{array}
$$

Substituting this into equation (4.50), we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}{F_{d1 - 2}} & = & {\frac{s_1 + (c - d\cos\alpha)dx / s_1 + d_2 - s_1 - d_2 - [c - (b + d)\cos\alpha]dx / d_2}{2dx}}\\ {} & = & {\frac{1}{2}\left[\frac{c - d\cos\alpha}{\sqrt{c^2 + d^2 - 2cd\cos\alpha}} -\frac{c - (b + d)\cos\alpha}{\sqrt{c^2 + (b + d)^2 - 2c(b + d)\cos\alpha}}\right].} \end{array}
$$

The same result could also have been obtained by letting

$$
F_{d1 - 2} = \lim_{a\to 0}F_{1 - 2},
$$

where  $F_{1 - 2}$  is the view factor from the previous example. Using de l'Hopital's rule to determine the value of the resulting expression leads to

$$
F_{d1 - 2} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial d_1}{\partial a} -\frac{\partial s_2}{\partial a}\right)\bigg|_{a = 0},
$$

and the above result.

Thus, the crossed- strings method may also be applied to strips. Example 4.1 could also have been solved this way; since the result is infinitesimal this computation would require retaining differentials up to second order. However, integration becomes simpler for strips of differential widths, while application of the crossed- strings method becomes more involved.

FIGURE 4-18 Configuration for view factor calculation of Example 4.12; string placement  $(a)$  for  $F_{1 - 2}^r$ $(b)$  for  $F_{1 - 2}^r$ .

We shall present one final example to show how view factors for curved surfaces and for configurations with floating obstructions can be determined by the crossed- strings method.

Example 4.12. Determine the view factor  $F_{1 - 2}$  for the configuration shown in Fig. 4- 18.

# Solution

In the figure the end points of  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  (pin points) have been labeled  $a,b,c,$  and  $d,$  and other strategic points have been labeled with capital letters. A closed- contour surface such as a cylinder may be modeled by placing two pins right next to each other, with surface  $A_{2}$  being a strongly bulging convex surface between the pins. While the location of the two pins on the cylinder is arbitrary, it is usually more convenient to pick a location out of sight of  $A_{1}$  . Since  $A_{1}$  can see  $A_{2}$  from both sides of the obstruction,  $F_{1 - 2}$  cannot be determined with a single set of strings. Using view factor algebra, we can state that

$$
F_{1 - 2} = F_{1 - 2}^{l} + F_{1 - 2}^{r},
$$

where  $F_{1 - 2}^{l}$  and  $F_{1 - 2}^{r}$  are the view factors between  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  when considering only light paths on the left or right of the obstruction, respectively. The placement of strings for  $F_{1 - 2}^{l}$  is given in Fig. 4- 18a, and for  $F_{1 - 2}^{r}$  in Fig. 4- 18b.

Considering first  $F_{1 - 2}^{l}$  the diagonals and sides may be determined from

$$
\begin{array}{ll}{d_1 = aD + DE + Ed,} & {d_2 = bA + AB + BC + Cc,}\\ {} & {}\\ {s_1 = aC + Cc,} & {s_2 = bA + AE + Ed.} \end{array}
$$

Substituting these expressions into equation (4.50) and canceling those terms that appear in a diagonal as well as in a side  $(Ed,bA,$  and  $Cc)$  , we obtain

$$
F_{1 - 2}^{l} = \frac{aD + DE + AB + BC - (aC + AE)}{2ab}.
$$

Looking at Fig. 4- 18a we also notice that  $aC = aD$  and  $AB = AE,$  so that

$$
F_{1 - 2}^{l} = \frac{BC + DE}{2ab} = \frac{\alpha R + (\pi - 2\beta - \alpha)R}{2\times 2R} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{2} -\beta\right).
$$

FIGURE 4-19 The inside sphere method.

But  $\cot \beta = \tan (\pi /2 - \beta) = R / (h + H)$ . Thus,

$$
F_{1 - 2}^{I} = \frac{1}{2}\tan^{-1}\frac{R}{h + H}.
$$

Similarly, we find from Fig. 4- 18b for  $F_{1 - 2}^{r}$

$$
d_{1} = aF + FI + IJ + Jd, \quad d_{2} = bG + GH + Hc,
$$

$$
s_1 = aF + FH + Hc, \qquad s_2 = bJ + Jd,
$$

$$
F_{1 - 2}^{r} = \frac{FI + IJ + bG + GH - (FH + bJ)}{2ab}.
$$

By inspection  $bG = bJ$  and  $FI = FH$ , leading to

$$
F_{1 - 2}^{r} = \frac{IJ + GH}{2ab} = \frac{\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \delta - \gamma\right)R + \left(\pi - 2\beta + \delta - \frac{\pi}{2} - \gamma\right)R}{2\times 2R}
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{2} -\beta -\gamma\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\tan^{-1}\frac{R}{h + H} -\tan^{-1}\frac{l}{h}\right).
$$

Note that this formula only holds as long as  $GH > 0$  (i.e., as long as the cylinder is seen without obstruction from point  $b$ ). Finally, adding the left and right contributions to the view factor,

$$
F_{1 - 2} = \tan^{-1}\frac{R}{h + H} -\frac{1}{2}\tan^{-1}\frac{l}{h}.
$$

# 4.8 THE INSIDE SPHERE METHOD

Consider two surfaces  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  that are both parts of the surface of one and the same sphere, as shown in Fig. 4- 19. We note that, for this type of configuration,  $\theta_{1} = \theta_{2} = \theta$  and  $S = 2R\cos \theta$ . Therefore,

$$
F_{d1 - 2} = \int_{A_2}\frac{\cos\theta_1\cos\theta_2}{\pi S^2} dA_2 = \int_{A_2}\frac{\cos^2\theta}{\pi(2R\cos\theta)^2} dA_2 = \frac{1}{4\pi R^2}\int_{A_2}dA_2 = \frac{A_2}{A_s}, \tag{4.51}
$$

FIGURE 4-20 View factor between coaxial parallel disks.

where  $A_{s} = 4\pi R^{2}$  is the surface area of the entire sphere. Similarly, from equation (4.16),

$$
F_{1 - 2} = F_{d1 - 2} = \frac{A_2}{A_s}, \tag{4.52}
$$

since  $F_{d1 - 2}$  does not depend on the position of  $dA_{1}$ . Therefore, because of the unique geometry of a sphere, the view factor between two surfaces on the same sphere only depends on the size of the receiving surface, and not on the location of either one.

The inside sphere method is primarily used in conjunction with view factor algebra, to determine the view factor between two surfaces that may not necessarily lie on a sphere.

Example 4.13. Find the view factor between two parallel, coaxial disks of radius  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$  using the inside sphere method.

# Solution

Inspecting Fig. 4- 20 we see that it is possible to place the parallel disks inside a sphere of radius  $R$  in such a way that the entire peripheries of both disks lie on the surface of the sphere.

Since all radiation from  $A_{1}$  to  $A_{2}$  travels on to the spherical cap  $A_{2}$  (in the absence of  $A_{2}$ ), and since all radiation from  $A_{1}$  to  $A_{2}$  must pass through  $A_{2}$ , we have

$$
F_{1 - 2} = F_{1 - 2^{\prime}}.
$$

Using reciprocity and applying a similar argument for  $A_{1}$  and spherical cap  $A_{1^{\prime}}$ , we find

$$
F_{1 - 2} = F_{1 - 2^{\prime}} = \frac{A_{2^{\prime}}}{A_{1}} F_{2^{\prime} - 1} = \frac{A_{2^{\prime}}}{A_{1}} F_{2^{\prime} - 1^{\prime}} = \frac{A_{1^{\prime}}A_{2^{\prime}}}{A_{1}A_{s}}.
$$

The areas of the spherical caps are readily calculated as

$$
A_{i} = 2\pi R^{2}\int_{0}^{\beta_{i}}\sin \beta d\beta = 2\pi R^{2}(1 - \cos \beta_{i}),\quad i = 1,2.
$$

Thus, with  $A_{1} = \pi R_{1}^{2}$  and  $A_{s} = 4\pi R^{2}$ , this results in

$$
F_{1 - 2} = \frac{(2\pi R^2)^2(1 - \cos\beta_1)(1 - \cos\beta_2)}{\pi R_1^24\pi R^2}.
$$

From Fig. 4- 20 one finds (assuming  $\beta_{i}\leq \pi /2$ )  $\cos \beta_{i} = \sqrt{R^{2} - R_{i}^{2}} /R$ , and

$$
F_{1 - 2} = \frac{1}{R_1^2}\Big(R - \sqrt{R^2 - R_1^2}\Big)\Big(R - \sqrt{R^2 - R_2^2}\Big).
$$

FIGURE 4-21 Surface projection for the unit sphere method.

It remains to find the radius of the sphere  $R$ , since only the distance between disks,  $h$ , is known. From Fig. 4- 20

$$
h = \sqrt{R^2 - R_1^2} +\sqrt{R^2 - R_2^2},
$$

which may be solved (by squaring twice), to give

$$
R^{2} = (X^{2} - 1)\left(\frac{R_{1}R_{2}}{h}\right)^{2},\quad X = \frac{h^{2} + R_{1}^{2} + R_{2}^{2}}{2R_{1}R_{2}}.
$$

This result is, of course, identical to the one given in Example 4.5, although it is not trivial to show this.

# 4.9 THE UNIT SPHERE METHOD

The unit sphere method is a powerful tool to calculate view factors between one infinitesimal and one finite area. It is particularly useful for the experimental determination of such view factors, as first stated by Nusselt [27]. An experimental implementation of the method through optical projection has been discussed by Farrell [28].

To determine the view factor  $F_{d1 - 2}$  between  $dA_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  we place a hemisphere of radius  $R$  on top of  $A_{1}$ , centered over  $dA_{1}$ , as shown in Fig. 4- 21. From equations (4.4) and (4.8) we may write

$$
F_{d1 - 2} = \int_{A_{2}}\frac{\cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2}}{\pi S^{2}} dA_{2} = \int_{\Omega_{2}}\frac{\cos\theta_{1}}{\pi} d\Omega_{2}. \tag{4.53}
$$

The solid angle  $d\Omega_{2}$  may also be expressed in terms of area  $dA_{2}^{\prime}$  ( $dA_{2}$  projected onto the hemisphere) as  $d\Omega_{2} = dA_{2}^{\prime} / R^{2}$ . Further, the area  $dA_{2}^{\prime}$  may be projected along the  $z$ - axis onto the plane of  $A_{1}$  as  $dA_{2}^{\prime \prime} = \cos \theta_{1}dA_{2}^{\prime \prime}$ . Thus,

$$
F_{d1 - 2} = \int_{A_2^{\prime}}\frac{\cos\theta_1}{\pi}\frac{dA_2^{\prime}}{R^2} = \int_{A_2^{\prime \prime}}\frac{dA_2^{\prime\prime}}{\pi R^2} = \frac{A_2^{\prime\prime}}{\pi R^2}, \tag{4.54}
$$

that is,  $F_{d1 - 2}$  is the fraction of the disk  $\pi R^{2}$  that is occupied by the double projection of  $A_{2}$ . Experimentally this can be measured, for example, by placing an opaque area  $A_{2}$  within a

![](images/49d4e753e0540139b90ca1cc1b6998459081f2ecf6f9c2c0b6327dcfaa97ed30.jpg)  
FIGURE 4-22 Geometry for the view factor in Example 4.14.

hemisphere, made of a translucent material, and which has a light source at the center (at  $dA_{1}$ ). Looking down onto the translucent hemisphere in the negative  $z$ - direction,  $A_{2}$ , will appear as a shadow. A photograph of the shadow (and the bright disk) can be taken, showing the double projection of  $A_{2}$ , and  $F_{d1 - 2}$  can be measured.

Example 4.14. Determine the view factor for  $F_{d1 - 2}$  between an infinitesimal area and a parallel disk as shown in Fig. 4- 22.

# Solution

While a hemisphere of arbitrary radius could be employed, we shall choose here for convenience a radius of  $R = \sqrt{a^2 + d^2}$ , i.e., a hemisphere that includes the periphery of the disk on its surface. Then  $A_{2}^{\prime \prime} = A_{2} = \pi a^{2}$ , and the view factor follows as

$$
F_{d1 - 2} = \frac{\pi a^2}{\pi R^2} = \frac{a^2}{a^2 + d^2}.
$$

Obviously, only a few configurations will allow such simple calculation of view factors. For a more general case it would be desirable to have some "cookbook formula" for the application of the method. This is readily achieved by looking at the vector representation of the surfaces. Any point on the periphery of  $A_{2}$  may be expressed as a vector

$$
\mathbf{s}_{12} = x\hat{\mathbf{1}} +y\hat{\mathbf{j}} +z\hat{\mathbf{k}}. \tag{4.55}
$$

The corresponding point on  $A_{2}^{\prime}$  may be expressed as

$$
\mathbf{s}_{12}^{\prime} = x^{\prime}\hat{\mathbf{1}} +y^{\prime}\hat{\mathbf{j}} +z^{\prime}\hat{\mathbf{k}} = \frac{R}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}}}\mathbf{s}_{12}, \tag{4.56}
$$

and on  $A_{2}^{\prime \prime}$  as

$$
\mathbf{s}_{12}^{\prime \prime} = x^{\prime \prime}\hat{\mathbf{1}} +y^{\prime \prime}\hat{\mathbf{j}} = x^{\prime}\hat{\mathbf{1}} +y^{\prime}\hat{\mathbf{j}}. \tag{4.57}
$$

Thus, any point  $(x, y, z)$  on  $A_{2}$  is double- projected onto  $A_{2}^{\prime \prime}$  as

$$
x_{2}^{\prime \prime} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}}} R,y_{2}^{\prime \prime} = \frac{y}{\sqrt{x^{2} + y^{2} + z^{2}}} R. \tag{4.58}
$$

Only the area formed by the projection of the periphery of  $A_{2}$  through equation (4.58) needs to be found. This integration is generally considerably less involved than the one in equation (4.8).

# RADIATIVE EXCHANGE BETWEEN GRAY, DIFFUSE SURFACES

# 5.1 INTRODUCTION

In this chapter we shall begin our analysis of radiative heat transfer rates within enclosures without a participating medium, making use of the view factors developed in the preceding chapter. We shall first deal with the simplest case of a black enclosure, that is, an enclosure where all surfaces are black.

Such simple analysis may often be sufficient, for example, for furnace applications with soot- covered walls. This will be followed by expanding the analysis to enclosures with gray, diffuse surfaces, whose radiative properties do not depend on wavelength, and which emit as well as reflect energy diffusely. Considerable experimental evidence demonstrates that most surfaces emit (and, therefore, absorb) diffusely except for grazing angles  $(\theta >60^{\circ})$ , which are unimportant for heat transfer calculations (for example, Fig. 3- 1). Most surfaces tend to be fairly rough and, therefore, reflect in a relatively diffuse fashion. Finally, if the surface properties vary little across that part of the spectrum over which the blackbody emissive powers of the surfaces are appreciable, then the simplification of gray properties may be acceptable.

In both cases- black enclosures as well as enclosures with gray, diffuse surfaces- - we shall first derive the governing integral equation for arbitrary enclosures, which is then reduced to a set of algebraic equations by applying it to idealized enclosures. At the end of the chapter solution methods to the general integral equations are briefly discussed.

# 5.2 RADIATIVE EXCHANGE BETWEEN BLACK SURFACES

Consider a black- walled enclosure of arbitrary geometry and with arbitrary temperature distribution as shown in Fig. 5- 1. An energy balance for  $dA$  yields, from equation (4.1),

$$
q(\mathbf{r}) = E_b(\mathbf{r}) - H(\mathbf{r}), \tag{5.1}
$$

where  $H$  is the irradiation onto  $dA$ . From the definition of the view factor, the rate with which energy leaves  $dA'$  and is intercepted by  $dA$  is  $(E_{b}(\mathbf{r}')dA')dF_{dA' - dA}$ . Therefore, the total rate of

![](images/1dcadd2d5d2a259ca1dc0434d722cf6519605660463bcd071bfe1879ca4286bb.jpg)  
FIGURE 5-1 A black enclosure of arbitrary geometry.

incoming heat transfer onto  $dA$  from the entire enclosure and from outside (for enclosures with some semitransparent surfaces and/or holes) is

$$
H(\mathbf{r})dA = \int_{A}E_{b}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA^{\prime} - dA}dA^{\prime} + H_{o}(\mathbf{r})dA, \tag{5.2}
$$

where  $H_{o}(\mathbf{r})$  is the external contribution to the irradiation, i.e., any part not due to emission from the enclosure surface. Using reciprocity, this may be stated as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{H(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{A}E_{b}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA^{\prime} - dA^{\prime}} + H_{o}(\mathbf{r})}\\ {= \int_{A}E_{b}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})\frac{\cos\theta\cos\theta^{\prime}}{\pi S^{2}} (\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dA^{\prime} + H_{o}(\mathbf{r}),} \end{array} \tag{5.3}
$$

where  $\theta$  and  $\theta^{\prime}$  are angles at the surface elements  $dA$  and  $dA^{\prime}$ , respectively, and  $S$  is the distance between them, as defined in Section 4.2. For an enclosure with known surface temperature distribution, the local heat flux is readily calculated as<sup>1</sup>

$$
\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{r}) = E_{b}(\mathbf{r}) - \int_{A}E_{b}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA - dA^{\prime}} - H_{o}(\mathbf{r}). \tag{5.4}
$$

To simplify the problem it is customary to break up the enclosure into  $N$  isothermal subsurfaces, as shown in Fig. 4- 2b. Then equation (5.4) becomes

$$
q_{i}(\mathbf{r}) = E_{bi} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}E_{bj}\int_{A_{j}}dF_{dA_{i} - dA_{j}} - H_{oi}(\mathbf{r}_{i}), \tag{5.5}
$$

or, from equation (4.16),

$$
q_{i}(\mathbf{r}_{i}) = E_{bi} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}E_{bj}F_{di - j}(\mathbf{r}_{i}) - H_{oi}(\mathbf{r}_{i}). \tag{5.6}
$$

![](images/c6d81d22de5897ef2ed38674944189a20580b8c32718d5954911047aa2f2ccf6.jpg)  
FIGURE 5-2 Two-dimensional black duct for Example 5.1.

Even though the temperature may be constant across  $A_{i},$  the heat flux is usually not since  $(i)$  the local view factor  $F_{di - j}$  nearly always varies across  $A_{i},$  and  $(ii)$  the external irradiation  $H_{oi}$  may not be uniform. We may calculate an average heat flux by averaging equation (5.6) over  $A_{i}$  .With  $\begin{array}{r}\int_{A_i}F_{di - j}dA_i = A_iF_{i - j} \end{array}$  this leads to

$$
q_{i} = \frac{1}{A_{i}}\int_{A_{i}}q_{i}(\mathbf{r}_{i})dA_{i} = E_{bi} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}E_{bj}F_{i - j} - H_{oi},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{5.7}
$$

where  $q_{i}$  and  $H_{oi}$  are now understood to be average values.

Employing equation (4.18) we rewrite  $E_{bi}$  as  $\sum_{j = 1}^{N}E_{bi}F_{i - j},$  or

$$
q_{i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}F_{i - j}(E_{bi} - E_{bj}) - H_{oi},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{5.8}
$$

In this equation the heat flux is expressed in terms of the net radiative energy exchange between surfaces  $A_{i}$  and  $A_{j}$ ,

$$
Q_{i - j} = q_{i - j}A_{i} = A_{i}F_{i - j}(E_{bi} - E_{bj}) = -Q_{j - i}. \tag{5.9}
$$

Example 5.1. Consider a very long duct as shown in Fig. 5- 2. The duct is  $30\mathrm{cm}\times 40\mathrm{cm}$  in cross- section, and all surfaces are black. The top and bottom walls are at temperature  $T_{1} = 1000\mathrm{K},$  while the side walls are at temperature  $T_{2} = 600\mathrm{K}$ . Determine the net radiative heat transfer rate (per unit duct length) on each surface.

# Solution

We may use either equation (5.7) or (5.8). We shall use the latter here since it takes better advantage of the symmetry of the problem (i.e., it uses the fact that the net radiative exchange between two surfaces at the same temperature must be zero). Thus, with no external irradiation, and using symmetry (e.g.,  $E_{b1} = E_{b3},F_{1 - 2} = F_{1 - 4},\mathrm{etc.})$

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & q_{1} = F_{1 - 2}(E_{b1} - E_{b2}) + F_{1 - 3}(E_{b1} - E_{b3}) + F_{1 - 4}(E_{b1} - E_{b4})\\ & \quad = 2F_{1 - 2}(E_{b1} - E_{b2}) = q_{3},\\ & q_{2} = q_{4} = 2F_{2 - 1}(E_{b2} - E_{b1}). \end{array}
$$

Only the view factors  $F_{1 - 2}$  and  $F_{2 - 1}$  are required, which are readily determined from the crossed- strings method as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{F_{1 - 2} = \frac{30 + 40 - (\sqrt{30^2 + 40^2} + 0)}{2\times 40} = \frac{1}{4},}\\ {F_{2 - 1} = \frac{A_1}{A_2} F_{1 - 2} = \frac{40}{30}\times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{3}.} \end{array}
$$

FIGURE 5-3 Concentric black spheres for Example 5.2.

Therefore (using a prime to indicate "per unit duct length"),

$$
\begin{array}{l}{Q_1^{\prime} = Q_2^{\prime} = 2A_1^{\prime}F_{1 - 2}\sigma (T_1^4 -T_2^4)}\\ {= 2\times 0.4\mathrm{m}\times 0.25\times 5.670\times 10^{-8}\frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{K}^4} (1000^4 -600^4)\mathrm{K}^4 = 9870\mathrm{W / m}}\\ {Q_2^{\prime} = Q_2^{\prime} = 2A_2^{\prime}F_{2 - 1}\sigma (T_2^4 -T_1^4) = -9870\mathrm{W / m}} \end{array}
$$

It is apparent from this example that the sum of all surface heat transfer rates must vanish. This follows immediately from conservation of energy: The total heat transfer rate into the enclosure (i.e., the heat transfer rates summed over all surfaces) must be equal to the rate of change of radiative energy within the enclosure. Since radiation travels at the speed of light, steady state is reached almost instantaneously, so that the rate of change of radiative energy may nearly always be neglected. Mathematically, we may multiply equation (5.7) by  $A_{i}$  and sum over all areas:

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{N}(Q_{i} + A_{i}H_{oi}) = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}A_{i}E_{bi} - \sum_{i = 1}^{N}A_{i}\sum_{j = 1}^{N}E_{bj}F_{i - j} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}A_{i}E_{bi} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}A_{j}E_{bj}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}F_{j - i} = 0. \tag{5.10}
$$

This relationship is most useful to check the correctness of one's calculations, or their accuracy (for computer calculations).

Example 5.2. Consider two concentric, isothermal, black spheres with radii  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$ , and temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , respectively, as shown in Fig. 5- 3. Show how the temperature of the inner sphere can be deduced, if temperature and heat flux of the outer sphere are measured.

# Solution

We have only two surfaces, and equation (5.8) becomes

$$
q_{1} = F_{1 - 2}(E_{b1} - E_{b2});q_{2} = F_{2 - 1}(E_{b2} - E_{b1}).
$$

Since all radiation from Sphere 1 travels to 2, we have  $F_{1 - 2} = 1$  and, by reciprocity,  $F_{2 - 1} = A_{1} / A_{2}$ . Thus,

$$
Q_{1} = -Q_{2} = A_{1}\sigma (T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4}).
$$

Solving this for  $T_{1}$  we get, with  $A_{i} = 4\pi R_{i}^{2}$ ,

$$
T_{1}^{4} = T_{2}^{4} - \left(\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}}\right)^{2}\frac{q_{2}}{\sigma}.
$$

Whenever  $T_{1}$  is larger than  $T_{2}$ ,  $q_{2}$  is negative, and vice versa.

FIGURE 5-4 Right-angled groove exposed to solar irradiation, Example 5.3.

Example 5.3. A right- angled groove, consisting of two long black surfaces of width  $a$ , is exposed to solar radiation  $q_{\mathrm{sol}}$  (Fig. 5- 4). The entire groove surface is kept isothermal at temperature  $T$ . Determine the net radiative heat transfer rate from the groove.

# Solution

Again, we may employ either equation (5.7) or (5.8). However, this time the enclosure is not closed; and we must close it artificially. We note that any radiation leaving the cavity will not come back (barring any reflection from other surfaces nearby). Thus, our artificial surface should be black. We also assume that, with the exception of the (parallel) solar irradiation, no external radiation enters the cavity. Since the solar irradiation is best treated separately through the external irradiation term  $H_{o}$ , our artificial surface is nonemitting. Both criteria are satisfied by covering the groove with a black surface at  $0\mathrm{K}$ . Even though we now have three surfaces, the last one does not really appear in equation (5.7) (since  $E_{b3} = 0$ ), but it does appear in equation (5.8). Using equation (5.7) we find

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{q_1 = E_{b1} - F_{1 - 2}E_{b2} - H_{o1} = \sigma T^4 (1 - F_{1 - 2}) - q_{\mathrm{sol}}\cos \alpha ,}\\ {q_2 = E_{b2} - F_{2 - 1}E_{b1} - H_{o2} = \sigma T^4 (1 - F_{2 - 1}) - q_{\mathrm{sol}}\sin \alpha .} \end{array}
$$

From Configuration 33 in Appendix D we find, with  $H = 1$

$$
\begin{array}{r}F_{1 - 2} = \frac{1}{2}\left(2 - \sqrt{2}\right) = 0.293 = F_{2 - 1}, \end{array}
$$

and

$$
Q^{\prime} = a(q_{1} + q_{2}) = a\left[\sqrt{2}\sigma T^{4} - q_{\mathrm{sol}}(\cos \alpha +\sin \alpha)\right].
$$

These examples demonstrate that equation (5.8) is generally more convenient to use for closed configurations, since it takes advantage of the fact that the net exchange between two surfaces at the same temperature (or with itself) is zero. Equation (5.7), on the other hand, is more convenient for open configurations, since the hypothetical surfaces employed to close the configuration do not contribute (because of their zero emissive power): With this equation the hypothetical closing surfaces may be completely ignored!

Equation (5.7) may be written in a third form that is most convenient for computer calculations. Using Kronecker's delta function, defined as

$$
\delta_{ij} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}1, & i = j,\\ 0, & i\neq j, \end{array} \right. \tag{5.11}
$$

we find  $\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\delta_{ij} = 1$  and  $\sum_{j = 1}^{N}E_{bj}\delta_{ij} = E_{bi}$ . Thus,

$$
q_{i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}(\delta_{ij} - F_{i - j})E_{bj} - H_{oi},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{5.12}
$$

Let us suppose that for surfaces  $i = 1,2,\ldots ,n$  the heat fluxes are prescribed (and temperatures are unknown), while for surfaces  $i = n + 1,\ldots ,N$  the temperatures are prescribed (heat fluxes unknown). Unlike for the heat fluxes, no explicit relations for the unknown temperatures exist. Placing all unknown temperatures on one side of equation (5.12), we may write

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{n}(\delta_{ij} - F_{i - j})E_{bj} = q_{i} + H_{oi} + \sum_{j = n + 1}^{N}F_{i - j}E_{bj},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,n, \tag{5.13}
$$

where everything on the right- hand side of the equation is known. In matrix form this is written<sup>2</sup> as

$$
\mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{b}} = \mathbf{b}, \tag{5.14}
$$

where

$$
\mathbf{A} = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}1 - F_{1 - 1} & -F_{1 - 2} & \dots & -F_{1 - n}\\ -F_{2 - 1} & 1 - F_{2 - 2} & \dots & -F_{2 - n}\\ \vdots & & \ddots & \vdots \\ -F_{n - 1} & -F_{n - 2} & \dots & 1 - F_{n - n} \end{array} \right), \tag{5.15}
$$

$$
\mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{b}} = \left( \begin{array}{c}E_{b1}\\ E_{b2}\\ \vdots \\ E_{bn} \end{array} \right),\mathbf{b} = \left( \begin{array}{c}q_{1} + H_{o1} + \sum_{j = n + 1}^{N}F_{1 - j}E_{bj}\\ q_{2} + H_{o2} + \sum_{j = n + 1}^{N}F_{2 - j}E_{bj}\\ \vdots \\ q_{n} + H_{on} + \sum_{j = n + 1}^{N}F_{n - j}E_{bj} \end{array} \right). \tag{5.16}
$$

The  $n \times n$  matrix  $\mathbf{A}$  is readily inverted on a computer (generally with the aid of a software library subroutine), and the unknown temperatures are calculated as

$$
\mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{b}} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{b}. \tag{5.17}
$$

# 5.3 RADIATIVE EXCHANGE BETWEEN GRAY, DIFFUSE SURFACES

We shall now assume that all surfaces are gray, that they are diffuse emitters, absorbers, and reflectors. Under these conditions  $\epsilon = \epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime} = \alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime} = \alpha = 1 - \rho$ . The total heat flux leaving a surface at location  $\mathbf{r}$  is, from Fig. 4- 1,

$$
J(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon (\mathbf{r})E_{b}(\mathbf{r}) + \rho (\mathbf{r})H(\mathbf{r}), \tag{5.18}
$$

which is called the surface radiosity  $J$  at location  $\mathbf{r}$ . Since both emission and reflection are diffuse, so is the resulting intensity leaving the surface:

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I(\mathbf{r}) = J(\mathbf{r}) / \pi . \tag{5.19}
$$

Therefore, an observer at a different location is unable to distinguish emitted and reflected

![](images/df0ab4baae895c225770c34ff2d99c1ca11398f9eba382a0045cdcc5bd0fc726.jpg)  
FIGURE 5-5 Qualitative spectral behavior of radiosity for irradiation from an isothermal source.

radiation on the basis of directional behavior. However, the observer may be able to distinguish the two as a result of their different spectral behavior. Consider Example 5.2 for the case of a black outer sphere but a gray, diffuse inner sphere. On the inner sphere the emitted radiation has the spectral distribution of a blackbody at temperature  $T_{1}$ , while the reflected radiation—which was originally emitted at the outer sphere—has the spectral distribution of a blackbody at temperature  $T_{2}$ . Thus, the spectral radiosity will behave as shown qualitatively in Fig. 5- 5. An observer will be able to distinguish between emitted and reflected radiation if he has the ability to distinguish between radiation at different wavelengths. A gray surface does not have this ability, since it behaves in the same fashion toward all incoming radiation at any wavelength, i.e., it is "color blind." Consequently, a gray surface does not "know" whether its irradiation comes from a gray, diffuse surface or from a black surface with an effective emissive power  $J$ . This fact simplifies the analysis considerably since it allows us to calculate radiative heat transfer rates between surfaces by balancing the net outgoing radiation (i.e., emission and reflection) traveling directly from surface to surface (as opposed to emitted radiation traveling to another surface directly or after any number of reflections). For this reason the following analysis is often referred to as the net radiation method.

Making an energy balance on a surface  $dA$  in the enclosure shown in Fig. 5- 6 we obtain from equation (4.2)

$$
q(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon (\mathbf{r})E_{b}(\mathbf{r}) - \alpha (\mathbf{r})H(\mathbf{r}) = J(\mathbf{r}) - H(\mathbf{r}). \tag{5.20}
$$

The irradiation  $H(\mathbf{r})$  is again found by determining the contribution from a differential area  $dA^{\prime}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})$ , followed by integrating over the entire surface. From the definition of the view factor the heat transfer rate leaving  $dA^{\prime}$  intercepted by  $dA$  is  $(J(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dA^{\prime})dF_{dA^{\prime} - dA}$ . Thus, similar to the black- surfaces case,

$$
H(\mathbf{r})dA = \int_{A}J(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA^{\prime} - dA}dA^{\prime} + H_{o}(\mathbf{r})dA, \tag{5.21}
$$

where  $H_{o}(\mathbf{r})$  is again any external radiation arriving at  $dA$ . Using reciprocity this equation reduces to

$$
H(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{A}J(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA - dA^{\prime}} + H_{o}(\mathbf{r}). \tag{5.22}
$$

Substitution into equation (5.20) yields

$$
q(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon (\mathbf{r})E_{b}(\mathbf{r}) - \alpha (\mathbf{r})\left[\int_{A}J(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA - dA^{\prime}} + H_{o}(\mathbf{r})\right]. \tag{5.23}
$$

Thus, the unknown heat flux (or temperature) could be calculated if the radiosity field had been known. A governing integral equation for radiosity is readily established by solving

![](images/4507119c60fb4b181425235ea41eff88615ccf841372770fe9c3b6dd64a4f6b7.jpg)  
FIGURE 5-6 Radiative exchange in a gray, diffuse enclosure.

equation (5.20) for  $J$ :

$$
J(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon (\mathbf{r})E_{o}(\mathbf{r}) + \rho (\mathbf{r})\left[\int_{A}J(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA - dA^{\prime}} + H_{o}(\mathbf{r})\right], \tag{5.24}
$$

for those surface locations where the temperature is known, or

$$
J(\mathbf{r}) = q(\mathbf{r}) + \int_{A}J(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA - dA^{\prime}} + H_{o}(\mathbf{r}), \tag{5.25}
$$

for those parts of the surface where the local heat flux is specified. However, in problems without participating media there is rarely a need to determine radiosity, and it is usually best to eliminate radiosity from equation (5.23). Expressing radiosity in terms of local temperature and heat flux and eliminating irradiation  $H$  from equation (5.20) we have

$$
q - \alpha q = (\epsilon E_{b} - \alpha H) - \alpha (J - H) = \epsilon E_{b} - \alpha J.
$$

Up to this point we have differentiated between emittance and absorptance, to keep the relations as general as possible (i.e., to accommodate nongray surface properties if necessary). We shall now invoke the assumption of gray, diffuse surfaces, or  $\alpha = \epsilon$ . Then

$$
q(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\epsilon(\mathbf{r})}{1 - \epsilon(\mathbf{r})} [E_{b}(\mathbf{r}) - J(\mathbf{r})]. \tag{5.26}
$$

Solving for radiosity, we get

$$
J(\mathbf{r}) = E_{b}(\mathbf{r}) - \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon(\mathbf{r})} -1\right)q(\mathbf{r}). \tag{5.27}
$$

Substituting this into equation (5.23), we obtain an integral equation relating temperature  $T$  and heat flux  $q$ :

$$
\frac{q(\mathbf{r})}{\epsilon(\mathbf{r})} -\int_{A}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})} -1\right)q(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA - dA^{\prime}} + H_{o}(\mathbf{r}) = E_{b}(\mathbf{r}) - \int_{A}E_{b}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA - dA^{\prime}}. \tag{5.28}
$$

Note that equation (5.28) reduces to equation (5.4) for a black enclosure. However, for a black enclosure with known temperature field the local heat flux can be determined with a simple integration over emissive power. For a gray enclosure an integral equation must be solved, i.e., an equation where the unknown dependent variable  $q(\mathbf{r})$  appears inside an integral. This requirement makes the solution considerably more difficult.

As for a black enclosure it is customary to break up a gray enclosure into  $N$  subsurfaces, over each of which the radiosity is assumed constant. Then equation (5.23) becomes

$$
\frac{q_i(\mathbf{r}_i)}{\epsilon_i(\mathbf{r}_i)} = E_{bi}(\mathbf{r}_i) - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}J_jF_{di - j}(\mathbf{r}_i) - H_{oi}(\mathbf{r}_i),\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{5.29}
$$

and, taking an average over subsurface  $A_{i}$ ,

$$
\frac{q_i}{\epsilon_i} = E_{bi} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}J_jF_{i - j} - H_{oi},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{5.30}
$$

Taking a similar average for equation (5.26) gives

$$
q_{i} = \frac{\epsilon_{i}}{1 - \epsilon_{i}}\left[E_{bi} - J_{i}\right]. \tag{5.31}
$$

Solving for  $J$  and substituting into equation (5.30) then leads to

$$
\frac{q_i}{\epsilon_i} -\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_j} -1\right)F_{i - j}q_j + H_{oi} = E_{bi} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}F_{i - j}E_{bj},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{5.32}
$$

This relation also follows directly from equation (5.28) if both  $(1 / \epsilon - 1)q$  and  $E_{b}$  (the components of  $J$ ) are assumed constant across the subsurfaces. Recalling the summation rule,  $\sum_{j = 1}^{N}F_{i - j} = 1$ , we may also write equation (5.32) as an interchange between surfaces,

$$
\frac{q_i}{\epsilon_i} -\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_j} -1\right)F_{i - j}q_j + H_{oi} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}F_{i - j}(E_{bi} - E_{bj}),\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{5.33}
$$

Either one of these equations, of course, reduces to equation (5.8) for a black enclosure. Equation (5.32) is preferred for open configurations, since it allows one to ignore hypothetical closing surfaces; and equation (5.33) is preferred for closed enclosures, because it eliminates transfer between surfaces at the same temperature.

Sometimes one wishes to determine the radiosity of a surface, for example, in the field of pyrometry (relating surface temperature to radiative intensity leaving a surface). Depending on which of the two is unknown, elimination of  $q_{i}$  or  $E_{bi}$  from equation (5.30) with the help of equation (5.31) leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{J_i = \epsilon_iE_{bi} + (1 - \epsilon_i)\left(\sum_{j = 1}^N J_jF_{i - j} + H_{oi}\right)}\\ {= q_i + \sum_{j = 1}^N J_jF_{i - j} + H_{oi},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N.} \end{array} \tag{5.34a}
$$

These two relations simply repeat the definition of radiosity, the first stating that radiosity consists of emitted and reflected heat fluxes and the second that radiosity, or outgoing heat flux, is equal to net heat flux (with negative  $q_{\mathrm{in}}$ ) plus the absolute value of  $q_{\mathrm{in}}$ .

Determine the net radiative heat transfer rates for each surface.

# Solution

Using equation (5.33) for  $i = 1$  and  $i = 2$ , and recalling that  $F_{1 - 2} = F_{1 - 4}$  and  $F_{2 - 1} = F_{2 - 3}$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{i = 1:\frac{q_1}{\epsilon_1} -2\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_2} -1\right)F_{1 - 2}q_2 - \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} -1\right)F_{1 - 3}q_1 = 2F_{1 - 2}(E_{b1} - E_{b2}),}\\ {i = 2:\frac{q_2}{\epsilon_2} -2\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} -1\right)F_{2 - 1}q_1 - \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_2} -1\right)F_{2 - 4}q_2 = 2F_{2 - 1}(E_{b2} - E_{b1}).} \end{array}
$$

We have already evaluated  $F_{1 - 2} = \frac{1}{4}$  and  $F_{2 - 1} = \frac{1}{3}$  in Example 5.1. From the summation rule  $F_{1 - 3} = 1 - 2F_{1 - 2} = \frac{1}{2}$  and  $F_{2 - 4} = 1 - 2F_{2 - 1} = \frac{1}{3}$ . Substituting these, as well as emittance values, into the relations reduces them to the simpler form of

$$
\begin{array}{r}\left[\frac{1}{0.3} -\left(\frac{1}{0.3} -1\right)\frac{1}{2}\right]q_1 - 2\left(\frac{1}{0.8} -1\right)\frac{1}{4} q_2 = 2\times \frac{1}{4} (E_{b1} - E_{b2}),\\ -2\left(\frac{1}{0.3} -1\right)\frac{1}{3} q_1 + \left[\frac{1}{0.8} -\left(\frac{1}{0.8} -1\right)\frac{1}{3}\right]q_2 = 2\times \frac{1}{3} (E_{b2} - E_{b1}), \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\frac{13}{6} q_1 - \frac{1}{8} q_2 = \frac{1}{2} (E_{b1} - E_{b2}),}\\ {-\frac{14}{9} q_1 + \frac{7}{6} q_2 = -\frac{2}{3} (E_{b1} - E_{b2}).} \end{array}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\left(\frac{13}{6}\times \frac{7}{6} -\frac{14}{9}\times \frac{1}{8}\right)q_1 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{7}{6} -\frac{2}{3}\times \frac{1}{8}\right)(E_{b1} - E_{b2}),}\\ {q_1 = \frac{3}{7}\times \frac{1}{2} (E_{b1} - E_{b2}) = \frac{3}{14}\sigma (T_1^4 -T_2^4),} \end{array}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\left(-\frac{1}{8}\times \frac{14}{9} +\frac{7}{6}\times \frac{13}{6}\right)q_2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{14}{9} -\frac{2}{3}\times \frac{13}{6}\right)(E_{b1} - E_{b2}),}\\ {q_2 = -\frac{3}{7}\times \frac{2}{3} (E_{b1} - E_{b2}) = -\frac{2}{7}\sigma (T_1^4 -T_2^4).} \end{array}
$$

Finally, substituting values for temperatures,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{Q_1^{\prime} = 0.4\mathrm{m}\times \frac{3}{14}\times 5.670\times 10^{-8}\frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{K}^4} (1000^4 -600^4)\mathrm{K}^4 = 4230\mathrm{W / m},}\\ {Q_2^{\prime} = -0.3\mathrm{m}\times \frac{2}{7}\times 5.670\times 10^{-8}\frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{K}^4} (1000^4 -600^4)\mathrm{K}^4 = -4230\mathrm{W / m}.} \end{array}
$$

Of course, both heat transfer rates must again add up to zero. We observe that these rates are less than half the ones for the black duct.

# Solution

Again applying equation (5.33) for  $i = 1$  (inner sphere) and  $i = 2$  (outer sphere), we obtain:

$$

With  $F_{1 - 1} = 0$ ,  $F_{1 - 2} = 1$ ,  $F_{2 - 1} = A_{1} / A_{2}$ , and  $F_{2 - 2} = 1 - F_{2 - 1} = 1 - A_{1} / A_{2}$ , these two equations reduce to

$$

$$
\Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} -1\Big)\frac{A_1}{A_2} q_1 + \Big[\frac{1}{\epsilon_2} -\Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon_2} -1\Big)\Big(1 - \frac{A_1}{A_2}\Big)\Big]q_2 = -\frac{A_1}{A_2}\sigma (T_1^4 -T_2^4).
$$

This may be solved for  $q_{1}$  by eliminating  $q_{2}$  (or using conservation of energy, i.e.,  $A_{1}q_{1} + A_{2}q_{2} = 0$ ), or

$$
q_{1} = \frac{\sigma(T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4})}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} + \frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} - 1\right)}. \tag{5.35}
$$

We note that equation (5.35) is not just limited to concentric spheres, but holds for any convex surface  $A_{1}$  (i.e., with  $F_{1 - 1} = 0$ ) that radiates only to  $A_{2}$  (i.e.,  $F_{1 - 2} = 1$ ) as indicated in Fig. 5- 8b. This is often convenient for a convex surface  $A_{i}$  placed into a large, isothermal environment ( $A_{a} \gg A_{i}$ ) at temperature  $T_{a}$ , leading to

$$
q_{i} = \epsilon_{i}\sigma (T_{i}^{4} - T_{a}^{4}). \tag{5.36}
$$

Surface  $A_{i}$  may also be a hypothetical one, closing an open configuration contained within a large environment.

Example 5.6. Repeat Example 5.3 for a groove whose surface is gray and diffuse, with emittance  $\epsilon$ , rather than black.

# Solution

Using equation (5.32) for the open configuration we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{i = 1:} & {\frac{q_1}{\epsilon} -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} -1\right)F_{1 - 2}q_2 + H_{o1} = \sigma T^4 (1 - F_{1 - 2}),}\\ {i = 2:} & {\frac{q_2}{\epsilon} -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} -1\right)F_{2 - 1}q_1 + H_{o2} = \sigma T^4 (1 - F_{2 - 1}),} \end{array}
$$

where we have made use of the fact that  $E_{b1} = E_{b2} = \sigma T^4$  and  $\epsilon_{1} = \epsilon_{2} = \epsilon$ . As in Example 5.3 we have  $F_{1 - 2} = F_{2 - 1} = 1 - \sqrt{2} /2$  and  $H_{o1} = q_{\mathrm{sol}}\cos \alpha$ ,  $H_{o2} = q_{\mathrm{sol}}\sin \alpha$ . Since we are only interested in the total heat loss we add the two equations, leading to

$$
\Big[\frac{1}{\epsilon} -\Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon} -1\Big)F_{1 - 2}\Big](q_1 + q_2) = \sqrt{2}\sigma T^4 -q_{\mathrm{sol}}(\cos \alpha +\sin \alpha),
$$

and

$$
Q^{\prime} = a(q_{1} + q_{2}) = \frac{a\Big[\sqrt{2}\sigma T^{4} - q_{\mathrm{sol}}(\cos\alpha + \sin\alpha)\Big]}{1 + \Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon} - 1\Big) / \sqrt{2}}.
$$

Comparing this result with that of Example 5.3, we see that the heat loss due to emission is decreased (less emission, but more effective heat loss of emitted energy due to reflection from the opposing surface), as is the solar heat gain (since some of the irradiation is reflected back out of the cavity).

Example 5.7. Consider the cavity shown in Fig. 5- 9, which consists of a cylindrical hole of diameter  $D$  and length  $L$ . The top of the cavity is covered with a disk, which has a hole of diameter  $d$ . The entire inside of the cavity is isothermal at temperature  $T$ , and is covered with a gray, diffuse material of emittance  $\epsilon$ . Determine the amount of radiation escaping from the cavity.

# Solution

For simplicity, since the entire surface is isothermal and has the same emittance, we use a single zone  $A_{1}$ , which comprises the entire groove surface (sides, bottom, and top). Therefore, equation (5.32) reduces to

$$
\Big[\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} -\Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} -1\Big)F_{1 - 1}\Big]q_1 = (1 - F_{1 - 1})E_{b1}.
$$

Since the total radiative energy rate leaving the cavity is  $Q_{1} = A_{1}q_{1}$ , we get

$$
Q_{1} = \frac{1 - F_{1 - 1}}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} - \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} - 1\right)F_{1 - 1}} A_{1}E_{b1}.
$$

The view factor  $F_{1 - 1}$  is easily determined by recognizing that  $F_{o - 1} = 1$  (and  $A_{o}$  is the opening at the top) and, by reciprocity,

$$
F_{1 - 1} = 1 - F_{1 - o} = 1 - \frac{A_o}{A_1} F_{o - 1} = 1 - \frac{A_o}{A_1}.
$$

Therefore, the radiative heat flux leaving the cavity, per unit area of opening, is

$$
\frac{Q_1}{A_o} = \frac{\left(1 - 1 + \frac{A_o}{A_1}\right)\frac{A_1}{A_o}E_{b1}}{\epsilon_1\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} - 1\right)\left(1 - \frac{A_o}{A_1}\right)} = \frac{E_{b1}}{1 + \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} - 1\right)\frac{A_o}{A_1}}.
$$

Thus, if  $A_{o} / A_{1}\ll 1,$  the opening of the cavity behaves like a blackbody with emissive power  $E_{b1}$  . Such cavities are commonly used in experimental methods in which blackbodies are needed for comparison. For example, a cavity with  $d / D = 1 / 2$  and  $L / D = 2$  has

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}\frac{A_o}{A_1} & = & \frac{\pi d^2 / 4}{2\pi D^2 / 4 - \pi d^2 / 4 + \pi DL} = \frac{d^2}{2D^2 - d^2 + 4DL}\\ & = & \frac{(d / D)^2}{2 - (d / D)^2 + 4(L / D)} = \frac{1 / 4}{2 - 1 / 4 + 4\times 2} = \frac{1}{39}. \end{array}
$$

For  $\epsilon_{1} = 0.5$  this results in an apparent emittance of

$$
\epsilon_{a} = \frac{Q_{1}}{A_{o}E_{b1}} = \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} - 1\right)\frac{A_{o}}{A_{1}}} = \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{1}{0.5} - 1\right)\frac{1}{39}} = \frac{39}{40} = 0.975.
$$

For computer calculations the Kronecker delta is introduced into equation (5.32), as was done for a black enclosure, leading to

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left[\frac{\delta_{ij}}{\epsilon_j} -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_j} -1\right)F_{i - j}\right]q_j = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left[\delta_{ij} - F_{i - j}\right]E_{bj} - H_{o}. \tag{5.37}
$$

If all the temperatures are known and the radiative heat fluxes are to be determined, equation (5.37) may be cast in matrix form as

$$
\mathbf{C}\cdot \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{b}} - \mathbf{h}_o, \tag{5.38}
$$

where C and A are matrices with elements

$$
\begin{array}{l}{C_{ij} = \frac{\delta_{ij}}{\epsilon_j} -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_j} -1\right)F_{i - j},}\\ {A_{ij} = \delta_{ij} - F_{i - j},} \end{array}
$$

and  $\mathbf{q},\mathbf{e}_{\mathrm{b}},$  and  $\mathbf{h}_{\mathrm{b}}$  are vectors of the unknown heat fluxes  $q_{j}$  and the known emissive powers  $E_{bj}$  and external irradiations  $H_{o j}.$  Equation (5.38) is solved by matrix inversion as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{C}^{-1}\cdot [\mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{b}} - \mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{o}}]. \end{array} \tag{5.39}
$$

If the emissive power is known over only some of the surfaces, and the heat fluxes are specified elsewhere, equation (5.38) may be rearranged into a similar equation for the vector containing all the unknowns. Subroutine graydiff is provided in Appendix F for the solution of the simultaneous equations (5.38), requiring surface information and a partial view factor matrix as input. The solution to a three- dimensional version of Example 5.4 is also given in the form of a program graydiffxch, which may be used as a starting point for the solution to other problems. Fortran90,  $\mathbb{C} + +$  as well as MATLAB® versions are provided. Several commercial solvers are also available, usually including software for view factor evaluation, such as TRASYS [1] and TSS [2].

FIGURE 5-10 Electrical network analogy for infinite parallel plates: (a) space resistance, (b) surface resistance, (c) total resistance.

# 5.4 ELECTRICAL NETWORK ANALOGY

While equation (5.37) represents the most convenient set of governing equations for numerical calculations on today's digital computers, some people prefer to get a physical feeling for the radiative exchange problem by representing it through an analogous electrical network, a method more suitable for analog computers—now nearly extinct. For completeness, we shall briefly present this electrical network method, which was first introduced by Oppenheim [3].

From equation (5.20) we have

$$
q_{i} = J_{i} - H_{i},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{5.40}
$$

or, with equations (5.30) and (5.31),

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q_i = J_i - \sum_{j = 1}^N J_jF_{i - j} - H_{oi},}\\ {= \sum_{j = 1}^N (J_i - J_j)F_{i - j} - H_{oi},i = 1,2,\ldots ,N.} \end{array} \tag{5.42}
$$

We shall first consider the simple case of two infinite parallel plates without external irradiation. Thus,  $N = 2$ ,  $H_{oi} = 0$ , and

$$
Q_{1} = A_{1}q_{1} = \frac{J_{1} - J_{2}}{\frac{1}{A_{1}F_{1 - 2}}} = -Q_{2}. \tag{5.43}
$$

As written, equation (5.43) may be interpreted as follows: If the radiosities are considered potentials,  $1 / A_{1}F_{1 - 2}$  is a radiative resistance between surfaces, or a space resistance, and  $Q$  is a radiative heat flow "current," then equation (5.43) is identical to the one governing an electrical current flowing across a resistor due to a voltage potential, as indicated in Fig. 5- 10a. The space resistance is a measure of how easily a radiative heat flux flows from one surface to another: The larger  $F_{1 - 2}$ , the more easily heat can travel from  $A_{1}$  to  $A_{2}$ , resulting in a smaller resistance. The same heat flux is also given by equation (5.31) as

$$
Q_{1} = \frac{E_{b1} - J_{1}}{\frac{1 - \epsilon_{1}}{A_{1}\epsilon_{1}}} = \frac{J_{2} - E_{b2}}{\frac{1 - \epsilon_{2}}{A_{2}\epsilon_{2}}} = -Q_{2}, \tag{5.44}
$$

where  $(1 - \epsilon_{i}) / A_{i}\epsilon_{i}$  are radiative surface resistances. This situation is shown in Fig. 5- 10b. The surface resistance describes a surface's ability to radiate. For the maximum radiator, a black surface, the resistance is zero. This fact implies that, for a finite heat flux, the potential drop

![](images/c438487838780e81bf1ade90c9edcedeeb26e6e691c55e9650e23a5a331ff438.jpg)  
FIGURE 5-11 Network representation for radiative heat flux between surface  $A_{i}$  and all other surfaces.

across a zero resistance must be zero, i.e.,  $J_{i} = E_{bi}$ . Of course, the radiosities may be eliminated from equations (5.43) and (5.44), and

$$
Q_{1} = \frac{E_{b1} - E_{b2}}{\frac{1 - \epsilon_{1}}{A_{1}\epsilon_{1}} + \frac{1}{A_{1}F_{1 - 2}} + \frac{1 - \epsilon_{2}}{A_{2}\epsilon_{2}}} = -Q_{2}, \tag{5.45}
$$

where the denominator is the total radiative resistance between surfaces  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$ . Since the three resistances are in series they simply add up as electrical resistances do; see Fig. 5- 10c.

This network analogy is readily extended to more complicated situations by rewriting equation (5.42) as

$$
Q_{i} = \frac{E_{bi} - J_{i}}{\frac{1 - \epsilon_{i}}{A_{i}\epsilon_{i}}} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\frac{J_{i} - J_{j}}{\frac{1}{A_{i}F_{i - j}}} -A_{i}H_{oi} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}Q_{i - j} - A_{i}H_{oi}. \tag{5.46}
$$

Thus, the total heat flux at surface  $i$  is the net radiative exchange between  $A_{i}$  and all the other surfaces in the enclosure. The electrical analog is shown in Fig. 5- 11, where the current flowing from  $E_{bi}$  to  $J_{i}$  is divided into  $N$  parallel lines, each with a different potential difference and with different resistors.

Example 5.8. Consider a solar collector shown in Fig. 5- 12a. The collector consists of a glass cover plate, a collector plate, and side walls. We shall assume that the glass is totally transparent to solar irradiation, which penetrates through the glass and hits the absorber plate with a strength of  $1000\mathrm{W / m^2}$ . The absorber plate is black and is kept at a constant temperature  $T_{1} = 77^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  by heating water flowing underneath it. The side walls are insulated and made of a material with emittance  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.5$ . The glass cover may be considered opaque to thermal (i.e., infrared) radiation with an emittance  $\epsilon_{3} = 0.9$ . The collector is  $1\mathrm{m}\times 1\mathrm{m}\times 10\mathrm{cm}$  in dimension and is reasonably evacuated to suppress free convection between absorber plate and glass cover. The convective heat transfer coefficient at the top of the glass cover is known to be  $h = 5.0\mathrm{W / m^2K}$ , and the temperature of the ambient is  $T_{a} = 17^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Estimate the collected energy for normal solar incidence.

# Solution

We may construct an equivalent network (Fig. 5- 12b), leading to

$$
Q_{1} = \frac{\sigma(T_{1}^{4} - T_{a}^{4})}{R_{13} + \frac{1 - \epsilon_{3}}{A_{3}\epsilon_{3}} + R_{3a}} -A_{1}q_{s},
$$

where  $R_{13}$  is the total resistance between surfaces  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{3}$ , and  $R_{3a}$  is the resistance, by radiation as well as free convection, between glass cover and environment. We note that, since  $A_{2}$  is insulated, there

![](images/5a6c010011005c924d1eff2946e89f6126aeb796e288894bd90fbe6684ad2955.jpg)  
FIGURE 5-12 Schematics for Example 5.8: (a) geometry, (b) network.

is no heat flux entering/leaving at  $E_{b2}$  and, from equation (5.44),  $J_{2} = E_{b2}$ . Thus, the total resistance between  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{3}$  comes from two parallel circuits, one with resistance  $1 / (A_{1}F_{1 - 3})$  and the other with two resistances in series,  $1 / (A_{1}F_{1 - 2})$  and  $1 / (A_{3}F_{3 - 2})$ , or

$$
\begin{array}{r}\frac{1}{R_{13}} = \frac{1}{1 / (A_1F_{1 - 3})} +\frac{1}{1 / (A_1F_{1 - 2}) + 1 / (A_3F_{3 - 2})}\\ = A_1F_{1 - 3} + \frac{1}{2} A_1F_{1 - 2} = A_1\left(F_{1 - 3} + \frac{1}{2} F_{1 - 2}\right), \end{array}
$$

where we have used the fact that  $A_{1}F_{1 - 2} = A_{3}F_{3 - 2}$  by symmetry. From Configuration 38 in Appendix D we obtain, with  $X = Y = 10$ ,  $F_{1 - 3} = 0.827$  and  $F_{1 - 2} = 1 - F_{1 - 3} = 0.173$ , and

$$
R_{13} = 1 / \left[1\mathrm{m}^2\times (0.827 + 0.5\times 0.173)\right] = 1.095\mathrm{m}^{-2}.
$$

The resistance between glass cover and ambient is a little more complicated. The total heat loss from the cover plate, by free convection and radiation, is

$$
Q_{3a} = \epsilon_3A_3\sigma (T_3^4 -T_a^4) + hA_3(T_3 - T_a),
$$

where we have assumed that the environment (sky) radiates to the collector with the ambient temperature  $T_{a}$ . To convert this to the correct form we rewrite it as

$$
Q_{3a} = \sigma (T_3^4 -T_a^4)A_3\left[\epsilon_3 + \frac{h(T_3 - T_a)}{\sigma(T_3^4 - T_a^4)}\right],
$$

or

$$
\frac{1}{R_{3a}} = A_3\left[\epsilon_3 + \frac{n}{\sigma}\frac{T_3 - T_a}{T_3^4 - T_a^4}\right] = A_3\left[\epsilon_3 + \frac{n}{\sigma}\frac{1}{T_3^3 + T_3^2T_a + T_3T_a^2 + T_a^3}\right].
$$

As a first approximation, if  $T_{3}$  is not too different from  $T_{a}$ ,

$$
\frac{1}{R_{3a}}\simeq A_3\left(\epsilon_3 + \frac{n}{4\sigma T_a^3}\right) = 1\mathrm{m}^2\left(0.9 + \frac{5\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{K}}{4\times 5.670\times 10^{-8}\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{K}^4\times(273 + 17)^3\mathrm{K}^3}\right) = \frac{1}{0.554}\mathrm{m}^2.
$$

Finally, substituting the resistances into the expression for  $Q_{1}$  we get

$$
Q_{1} = \frac{5.670\times 10^{-8}\mathrm{W / m^{2}K^{4}}\left[(273 + 77)^{4} - (273 + 17)^{4}\right]\mathrm{K^{4}}}{1.095\mathrm{m}^{-2} + \frac{1 - 0.9}{0.9\mathrm{m}^{2}} + 0.554\mathrm{m}^{-2}} -1\mathrm{m}^{2}\times 1000\mathrm{W / m}^{2}
$$

![](images/3f8a8b82c01ac86933c3be1e169c311c09de94a2d2e54a983ec8a6774ce07e24.jpg)  
FIGURE 5-13Concentric cylinders (or spheres) with  $N$  radiation shields between them.

Since the system could collect a theoretical maximum of  $- 1000\mathrm{W}$ , the collector efficiency is

$$
\eta_{\mathrm{collector}} = \frac{Q_1}{A_1q_s} = \frac{744}{1000} = 0.744 = 74.4\% .
$$

This efficiency should be compared with an uncovered black collector plate, whose net heat flux would be

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{Q_1 = A_1\left[\sigma (T_1^4 -T_a^4) + h(T_1 - T_a) - q_s\right]} & {}\\ {= 1\mathrm{m}^2\left[5.670\times 10^{-8}\times (350^4 -290^4) + 5\times (350 - 290) - 1000\right]\mathrm{W / m}^2} & {}\\ {= -250\mathrm{W}.} & {} \end{array}
$$

Thus, an unprotected collector at that temperature would have an efficiency of only  $25\%$ .

The electrical network analogy is a very simple and physically appealing approach for simple two- and three- surface enclosures, such as the one of the previous example. However, in more complicated enclosures with multiple surfaces the method quickly becomes tedious and intractable.

# 5.5 RADIATION SHIELDS

In high- performance insulating materials it is common to suppress conductive and convective heat transfer by evacuating the space between two surfaces. This leaves thermal radiation as the dominant heat loss mode even for low- temperature applications such as insulation in cryogenic storage tanks. The radiation loss may be minimized by placing a multitude of closely spaced, parallel, highly reflective radiation shields between the surfaces. The radiation shields are generally made of thin metallic foils or, to reduce conductive losses further, of dielectric foils coated with metallic films. In either case radiation shields tend to be very specular reflectors. However, for closely spaced shields the directional behavior of the reflectance tends to be irrelevant and assuming diffuse reflectances gives excellent accuracy (see also Example 6.9 in the following chapter).

A typical arrangement for  $N$  radiation shields between two concentric cylinders (or concentric spheres) is shown in Fig. 5- 13. This geometry includes the case of parallel plates for

large (and nearly equal) radii. Let the inner cylinder have temperature  $T_{i},$  surface area  $A_{i},$  and emittance  $\epsilon_{i}$  . Similarly, each shield has temperature  $T_{n}$  (unknown),  $A_{n},\epsilon_{ni}$  (on its inner surface), and  $\epsilon_{no}$  (on its outer surface). The last shield,  $A_{N},$  faces the outer cylinder with  $T_{o},A_{o}$  and  $\epsilon_0$  The net radiative heat rate leaving  $A_{i}$  is, of course, equal to the heat rate going through each shield and to the one arriving at  $A_0$  .This net heat rate may be readily determined from the electrical network analogy, or by repeated application of the enclosure relations, equation (5.32). However, this is the type of problem for which the network analogy truly shines and we will use this method here. The case of concentric surfaces was already evaluated in Example 5.5, so that the net heat rate between any two of the concentric cylinders is then

$$
Q = \frac{E_{bj} - E_{bk}}{R_{j - k}},R_{j - k} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_jA_j} +\frac{1}{A_k}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_k} -1\right). \tag{5.47}
$$

Therefore, we may write

$$
QR_{i - 1i} = E_{bi} - E_{b1},
$$

$$
QR_{1o - 2i} = E_{b1} - E_{b2},
$$

$$
QR_{N o - o} = E_{b N} - E_{b o}.
$$

Adding all these equations eliminates all the unknown shield temperatures, and, after solving for the heat flux, we obtain

$$
Q = \frac{E_{bj} - E_{bo}}{R_{i - 1i} + \sum_{n = 1}^{N - 1}R_{n o - n + 1,i} + R_{N o - o}}. \tag{5.48}
$$

Example 5.9. A Dewar holding 4 liters of liquid helium at  $4.2\mathrm{K}$  consists essentially of two concentric stainless steel  $(\epsilon = 0.3)$  cylinders of  $50\mathrm{cm}$  length, and inner and outer diameters of  $D_{i} = 10\mathrm{cm}$  and  $D_{o} = 20\mathrm{cm}$ , respectively. The space between the cylinders is evacuated to a high vacuum to eliminate conductive/convective heat losses. Radiation shields are to be placed between the Dewar walls to reduce radiative losses to the point that it takes 24 hours for the 4- liter filling to evaporate if the Dewar is placed into an environment at  $298\mathrm{K}$ . For the purpose of this example the following may be assumed: (i) End losses as well as conduction/convection losses are negligible, (ii) the wall temperatures are at  $T_{i} = 4.2\mathrm{K}$  and  $T_{o} = 298\mathrm{K}$ , respectively, and (iii) radiation is one- dimensional. Thin plastic sheets coated on both sides with aluminum  $(\epsilon = 0.05)$  are available as shield material. Estimate the number of shields required. The heat of evaporation for helium at atmospheric pressure is  $h_{fg,\mathrm{He}} = 20.94\mathrm{J / g}$  (which is a very low value compared with other liquids), and the liquid density is  $\rho_{\mathrm{He}} = 0.125\mathrm{g / cm}^3$  [4].

# Solution

The total heat required to evaporate 4 liters of liquid helium is

$$
Q = \rho_{\mathrm{He}}V_{\mathrm{He}}h_{fg,\mathrm{He}} = 0.125\frac{\mathrm{g}}{\mathrm{cm}^3}\times 4\mathrm{liters}\times \frac{10^3\mathrm{cm}^3}{\mathrm{liter}}\times 20.94\frac{\mathrm{J}}{\mathrm{g}} = 10.47\mathrm{kJ}.
$$

If all of this energy is supplied through radial radiation over a time period of 24 hours, one infers that the heat flux in equation (5.48) must be held at or below  $\dot{Q} = Q / 24\mathrm{h} = 10,470 / (24\mathrm{h}\times (1\mathrm{h} / 3600\mathrm{s}) = 0.1212\mathrm{W},$  or  $q_{i} = \dot{Q} /A_{i} = 0.1212\mathrm{W} / (\pi \times 10\mathrm{cm}\times 50\mathrm{cm}) = 7.71\times 10^{- 5}\mathrm{W / cm}^{2}$ . Therefore, the total resistance must, from equation (5.48), be a minimum of

$$
\begin{array}{rl}A_{i}R_{\mathrm{tot}} & = |E_{bi} - E_{bo}| / q_{i} = 5.670\times 10^{-12}\times |4.2^{4} - 298^{4}| / 7.71\times 10^{-5}\\ & = 580.0. \end{array}
$$

We note from equation (5.47) that the resistances are inversely proportional to shield area. Therefore, it is best to place the shields as close to the inner cylinder as possible. We will assume that the shields

can be so closely spaced that  $A_{i} \simeq A_{2} \simeq \ldots \simeq A_{N} = A_{s} = \pi D_{s}L$ , with  $D_{s} = 11 \mathrm{cm}$ . Evaluating the total resistance from equations (5.47) and (5.48), we find

$$
A_{i}R_{\mathrm{tot}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_{w}} +\Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{s}} -1\Big)\frac{A_{i}}{A_{s}} +\sum_{n = 1}^{N - 1}\Big(\frac{2}{\epsilon_{s}} -1\Big)\frac{A_{i}}{A_{s}} +\frac{1}{\epsilon_{s}}\frac{A_{i}}{A_{s}} +\Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{w}} -1\Big)\frac{A_{i}}{A_{o}},
$$

where  $\epsilon_{w} = 0.3$  is the emittance of the (stainless steel) walls, and  $\epsilon_{s} = 0.05$  is the emittance of the (aluminized) shields. Since the elements of the series in the last equation do not depend on  $n$ , we may solve for  $N$  as

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}N & = & \frac{A_iR_{\mathrm{tot}} - \frac{1}{\epsilon_w} - \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_w} - 1\right)\frac{A_i}{A_o}}{\left(\frac{2}{\epsilon_s} - 1\right)\frac{A_i}{A_s}}\\ & = & \frac{580.0 - \frac{1}{0.3} - \left(\frac{1}{0.3} - 1\right)\frac{10}{20}}{\left(\frac{2}{0.05} - 1\right)\frac{10}{11}}\\ & = & 16.23. \end{array}
$$

Therefore, a minimum of 17 radiation shields would be required. Note from equation (5.35) that, without radiation shields,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{q_i = \frac{|E_{bi} - E_{bo}|}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_w} + \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_w} - 1\right)\frac{A_i}{A_o}} = \frac{5.670\times 10^{-12}|4.2^4 - 298^4|}{\frac{1}{0.3} + \left(\frac{1}{0.3} - 1\right)\times\frac{1}{2}}}\\ {= 9.94\times 10^{-3}\mathrm{W / cm^2},} \end{array}
$$

that is, the heat loss is approximately 100 times larger!

# 5.6 SOLUTION METHODS FOR THE GOVERNING INTEGRAL EQUATIONS

The usefulness of the method described in the previous sections is limited by the fact that it requires the radiosity to be constant over each subsurface. This is rarely the case if the subsurfaces of the enclosure are relatively large (as compared with typical distances between surfaces). Today, with the advent of powerful digital computers, more accurate solutions are usually obtained by increasing the number of subsurfaces,  $N$ , in equation (5.37), which then become simply a finite- difference solution to the integral equation (5.28). Still, there are times when more accurate methods for the solution of equation (5.28) are desired (for computational efficiency), or when exact or approximate solutions are sought in explicit form. Therefore, we shall give here a very brief outline of such solution methods.

If radiosity  $J$  is to be determined, the governing equation that needs to be solved is either equation (5.24), if the surface temperature is given, or equation (5.25), if surface heat flux is specified. If unknown temperatures or heat fluxes are to be determined directly, equation (5.28) must be solved. In all cases the governing equation may be written as a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind,

$$
\phi (\mathbf{r}) = f(\mathbf{r}) + \int_{A}K(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}^{\prime})\phi (\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dA^{\prime}, \tag{5.49}
$$

where  $K(\mathbf{r}, \mathbf{r}^{\prime})$  is called the kernel of the integral equation,  $f(\mathbf{r})$  is a known function, and  $\phi (\mathbf{r})$  is the function to be determined (e.g., radiosity or heat flux). Comprehensive discussions for the treatment of such integral equations are given in mathematical texts such as Courant and Hilbert [5] or Hildebrand [6]. A number of radiative heat transfer examples have been discussed by Özigik [7].

Numerical solutions to equation (5.49) may be found in a number of ways. In the method of successive approximation a first guess of  $\phi (\mathbf{r}) = f(\mathbf{r})$  is made with which the integral in equation (5.49) is evaluated (analytically in some simple situations, but more often through numerical quadrature). This leads to an improved value for  $\phi (\mathbf{r})$ , which is substituted back into the integral, and so on. This scheme is known to converge for all surface radiation problems. Another possible solution method is reduction to algebraic equations by using numerical quadrature for the integral, i.e., replacing it by a series of quadrature coefficients and nodal values. This leads to a set of equations similar to equation (5.37), but of higher accuracy. This type of solution method is most easily extended to arbitrary, three- dimensional geometries, for example, as recently demonstrated by Daun and Hollands [8], who employed nonuniform rational B- splines (NURBS) to express the surfaces. A third method of solution has been given by Sparrow and Haji- Sheikh [9], who demonstrated that the method of variational calculus may be applied to general problems governed by a Fredholm integral equation.

Most early numerical solutions in the literature dealt with two very basic systems. The problem of two- dimensional parallel plates of finite width was studied in some detail by Sparrow and coworkers [9- 11], using the variational method. The majority of studies have concentrated on radiation from cylindrical holes because of the importance of this geometry for cylindrical tube flow, as well as for the preparation of a blackbody for calibrating radiative property measurements. The problem of an infinitely long isothermal hole radiating from its opening was first studied by Buckley [12] and by Eckert [13]. Buckley's work appears to be the first employing the kernel approximation method. Much later, the same problem was solved exactly through the method of successive approximation (with numerical quadrature) by Sparrow and Albers [14]. A finite hole, but with both ends open, was studied by a number of investigators. Usiskin and Siegel [15] considered the constant wall heat flux case, using the kernel approximation as well as a variational approach. The constant wall temperature case was studied by Lin and Sparrow [16], and combined convection/surface radiation was investigated by Perlmutter and Siegel [17, 18]. Of greater importance for the manufacture of a blackbody is the isothermal cylindrical cavity of finite depth, which was studied by Sparrow and coworkers [19, 20] using successive approximations. If part of the opening is covered by a flat ring with a smaller hole, such a cavity behaves like a blackbody for very small  $L / R$  ratios. This problem was studied by Alfano [21] and Alfano and Sarno [22]. Because of their importance for the manufacture of blackbody cavities these results are summarized in Table 5.1. A detector removed from the cavity will sense a signal proportional to the intensity leaving the bottom center of the cavity in the normal direction. Thus the effectiveness of the blackbody is measured by how close to unity the ratio  $I_{n} / I_{b}(T)$  is. For perfectly diffuse reflectors,  $I_{n} = J / \pi$ , and with  $I_{b} = \sigma T^{4} / \pi$  an apparent emittance is defined as

$$
\epsilon_{a} = I_{n} / I_{b}(T) = J / \sigma T^{4}. \tag{5.50}
$$

To give an outline of how the different methods may be applied we shall, over the following few pages, solve the same simple example by three different methods, the first two being "exact," and the third being the kernel approximation.

Example 5.10. Consider two long parallel plates of width  $w$  as shown in Fig. 5- 14. Both plates are isothermal at the (same) temperature  $T$ , and both have a gray, diffuse emittance of  $\epsilon$ . The plates are separated by a distance  $h$  and are placed in a large, cold environment. Determine the local radiative heat fluxes along the plate using the method of successive approximation.

# Solution

From equation (5.24) we find, with  $dF_{di - di} = 0$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{J_1(x_1) = \epsilon \sigma T^4 +(1 - \epsilon)\int_0^w J_2(x_2)dF_{d1 - d2},}\\ {J_2(x_2) = \epsilon \sigma T^4 +(1 - \epsilon)\int_0^w J_1(x_1)dF_{d2 - d1},} \end{array}
$$

and, from Configuration 1 in Appendix D, with  $s_{12} = h / \cos \phi$ ,  $s_{12} d\phi = dx_{2} \cos \phi$ , and  $\cos \phi = h / \sqrt{h^{2} + (x_{2} - x_{1})^{2}}$ ,

$$

$$

Introducing nondimensional variables  $W = w / h$ ,  $\xi = x / h$ , and  $\mathcal{J}(x) = J(x) / \sigma T^{4}$ , and realizing that, as a result of symmetry,  $J_{1} = J_{2}$  (and  $q_{1} = q_{2}$ ), we may simplify the governing integral equation to

$$
\mathcal{J}(\xi) = \epsilon +\frac{1}{2} (1 - \epsilon)\int_{0}^{W}\mathcal{J}(\xi^{\prime})\frac{d\xi^{\prime}}{[1 + (\xi^{\prime} - \xi)^{2}]^{3 / 2}}. \tag{5.51}
$$

Making a first guess of  $\mathcal{J}^{(1)} = \epsilon$  we obtain a second guess by substitution,

$$
\begin{array}{l}\mathcal{J}^{(2)}(\xi) = \epsilon \left\{1 + \frac{1}{2} (1 - \epsilon)\int_{0}^{W}\frac{d\xi^{\prime}}{[1 + (\xi^{\prime} - \xi)^{2}]^{3 / 2}}\right\} \\ = \epsilon \left\{1 + \frac{1}{2} (1 - \epsilon)\left[\frac{W - \xi}{\sqrt{1 + (W - \xi)^{2}}} +\frac{\xi}{\sqrt{1 + \xi^{2}}}\right]\right\} . \end{array}
$$

$$

where the last integral becomes quite involved. We shall stop at this point since further successive integrations would have to be carried out numerically. It is clear from the above expression that the terms in the series diminish as  $\epsilon [(1 - \epsilon)W]^n$ , i.e., few successive iterations are necessary for surfaces with low reflectances and/or  $w / h$  ratios. Once the radiosity has been determined the local heat flux follows from equation (5.26). Limiting ourselves to  $\mathcal{J}^{(2)}$  (single successive approximation), this yields

$$
\begin{array}{l}\Psi (\xi) = \frac{q(\xi)}{\sigma T^4} = \frac{\epsilon}{1 - \epsilon} [1 - \mathcal{J}(\xi)]\\ = \epsilon -\frac{\epsilon^2}{2}\left[\frac{W - \xi}{\sqrt{1 + (W - \xi)^2}} +\frac{\xi}{\sqrt{1 + \xi^2}}\right] - \mathcal{O}\big(\epsilon^2 (1 - \epsilon)W^2\big), \end{array}
$$

where  $\mathcal{O}(z)$  is shorthand for "order of magnitude  $z$ ." Some results are shown in Fig. 5- 15 and compared with other solution methods for the case of  $W = w / h = 1$  and three values of the emittance. Observe that the heat loss is a minimum at the center of the plate, since this location receives maximum irradiation from the other plate (i.e., the view factor from this location to the opposing plate is maximum). For decreasing  $\epsilon$  the heat loss increases, of course, since more is emitted; however, this increase is less than linear since also more energy is coming in, of which a larger fraction is absorbed. The first successive approximation does very well for small and large  $\epsilon$  as expected from the order of magnitude of the neglected terms.

Example 5.11. Repeat Example 5.10 using numerical quadrature.

# Solution

The governing equation is, of course, again equation (5.51). We shall approximate the integral on the right- hand side by a series obtained through numerical integration, or quadrature. In this method an integral is approximated by a weighted series of the integrand evaluated at a number of nodal points; or

$$
\int_{a}^{b}f_{j}(\xi ,\xi^{\prime})d\xi^{\prime}\simeq (b - a)\sum_{j = 1}^{J}c_{j}f(\xi ,\xi_{j}),\qquad \sum_{j = 1}^{J}c_{j} = 1. \tag{5.52}
$$

Here the  $\xi_{j}$  represent  $J$  locations between  $a$  and  $b$ , and the  $c_{j}$  are weight coefficients. The nodal points  $\xi_{j}$  may be equally spaced for easy presentation of results (Newton- Cotes quadrature), or their location may be optimized for increased accuracy (Gaussian quadrature); for a detailed treatment of quadrature see, for example, the book by Froberg [23].

Using equation (5.52) in equation (5.51) we obtain

$$
\mathcal{J}_i = \epsilon +(1 - \epsilon)W\sum_{j = 1}^J c_j\mathcal{J}_jf_{ij},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,J,
$$

where

$$
f_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\Big / \Big[1 + (\xi_j - \xi_i)^2\Big]^{3 / 2}.
$$

This system of equations may be further simplified by utilizing the symmetry of the problem, i.e.,  $\mathcal{J}(\xi) = \mathcal{J}(W - \xi)$ . Assuming that nodes are placed symmetrically about the centerline,  $\xi_{j + 1 - j} = \xi_{j}$ , leads to  $c_{j + 1 - j} = c_{j}$  and  $\mathcal{J}_{j + 1 - j} = \mathcal{J}_{j}$ , or

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {J\mathrm{odd:}\mathcal{J}_i = \epsilon +(1 - \epsilon)W\left\{\sum_{j = 1}^{(J - 1) / 2}c_j\mathcal{J}_j[f_{ij} + f_{i,l + 1 - j}] + c_{(J + 1) / 2}\mathcal{J}_{(J + 1) / 2}f_{i(l + 1) / 2}\right\} ,i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{J + 1}{2},}\\ & {J\mathrm{even:}\mathcal{J}_i = \epsilon +(1 - \epsilon)W\sum_{j = 1}^{J / 2}c_j\mathcal{J}_j(f_{ij} + f_{i,l + 1 - j}),i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{J}{2}.} \end{array}
$$

The values of the radiosities may be determined by successive approximation, or by direct matrix inversion. In Fig. 5- 15 the simple case of  $J = 5$  (resulting in three simultaneous equations) is included, using Newton- Cotes quadrature with  $\xi_{j} = W(j - 1) / 4$  and  $c_{1} = c_{5} = 7 / 90$ ,  $c_{2} = c_{4} = 32 / 90$ , and  $c_{3} = 12 / 90$  [23].

Exact analytical solutions that yield explicit relations for the unknown radiosity are rare and limited to a few special geometries. However, approximate analytical solutions may be found for many geometries through the kernel approximation method. In this method the kernel  $K(x,x^{\prime})$  is approximated by a linear series of special functions such as  $e^{- ax^{\prime}}$ ,  $\cos ax^{\prime}$ ,  $\cosh ax^{\prime}$ , and so on (i.e., functions that, after one or two differentiations with respect to  $x^{\prime}$ , turn back into the original function except for a constant factor). It is then often possible to convert integral equation (5.49) into a differential equation that may be solved explicitly. The method is best illustrated through an example.

Example 5.12. Repeat Example 5.11 using the kernel approximation method.

# Solution

We again need to solve equation (5.51), this time by approximating the kernel. For convenience we shall choose a simple exponential form,

$$
K(\xi ,\xi^{\prime}) = \frac{1}{[1 + (\xi^{\prime} - \xi)^{2}]^{3 / 2}}\simeq ae^{-b|\xi^{\prime} - \xi |}.
$$

We shall determine "optimum" parameters  $a$  and  $b$  by letting the approximation satisfy the  $0th$  and  $1st$  moments. This implies multiplying the expression by  $|\xi^{\prime} - \xi |$  raised to the  $0th$  and  $1st$  powers, followed by integration over the entire domain for  $|\xi^{\prime} - \xi |$ , i.e., from 0 to  $\infty$  (since  $W$  could be arbitrarily large).

Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{(1 + x^2)^{3 / 2}} = 1 = \int_0^\infty ae^{-bx}dx = \frac{a}{b},}\\ & {\int_0^\infty \frac{xdx}{(1 + x^2)^{3 / 2}} = 1 = \int_0^x ae^{-bx}dx = \frac{a}{b^2},} \end{array}
$$

leading to  $a = b = 1$  and

$$
K(\xi ,\xi^{\prime})\simeq e^{-|\xi^{\prime} - \xi |}.
$$

Substituting this expression into equation (5.51) leads to

$$
\mathcal{J}(\xi)\simeq \epsilon +\frac{1}{2} (1 - \epsilon)\left[\int_{0}^{\xi}\mathcal{J}(\xi^{\prime})e^{-(\xi -\xi^{\prime})}d\xi^{\prime} + \int_{\xi}^{W}\mathcal{J}(\xi^{\prime})e^{-(\xi^{\prime} - \xi)}d\xi^{\prime}\right].
$$

We shall now differentiate this expression twice with respect to  $\xi$ , for which we need to employ Leibniz's rule, equation (3.106). Therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{r}\frac{d\mathcal{J}}{d\xi} = \frac{1}{2} (1 - \epsilon)\left[\mathcal{J}(\xi) - \int_0^\xi \mathcal{J}(\xi ')e^{-(\xi -\xi ')}d\xi ' - \mathcal{J}(\xi) + \int_\xi^W\mathcal{J}(\xi ')e^{-(\xi ' - \xi)}d\xi '\right],\\ \frac{d^2\mathcal{J}}{d\xi^2} = \frac{1}{2} (1 - \epsilon)\left[-\mathcal{J}(\xi) + \int_0^\xi \mathcal{J}(\xi ')e^{-(\xi -\xi ')}d\xi ' - \mathcal{J}(\xi) + \int_\xi^W\mathcal{J}(\xi ')e^{-(\xi ' - \xi)}d\xi '\right], \end{array}
$$

or, by comparison with the expression for  $\mathcal{J}(\xi)$

$$
\frac{d^2\mathcal{J}}{d\xi^2} = \mathcal{J} - \epsilon -(1 - \epsilon)\mathcal{J} = \epsilon (\mathcal{J} - 1).
$$

Thus, the governing integral equation has been converted into a second- order ordinary differential equation, which is readily solved as

$$
\mathcal{J}(\xi) = 1 + C_1e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon}\xi} + C_2e^{+\sqrt{\epsilon}\xi}.
$$

While an integral equation does not require any boundary conditions, we have converted the governing equation into a differential equation that requires two boundary conditions in order to determine  $C_1$  and  $C_2$ . The dilemma is overcome by substituting the general solution back into the governing integral equation (with approximated kernel). This calculation can be done for variable values of  $\xi$  by comparing coefficients of independent functions of  $\xi$ , or simply for two arbitrarily selected values for  $\xi$ . The first method gives the engineer proof that his analysis is without mistake, but is usually considerably more tedious. Often it is also possible to employ symmetry, as is the case here, since  $\mathcal{J}(\xi) = \mathcal{J}(W - \xi)$  or

$$
C_1\left[e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon}\xi} - e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon}(W - \xi)}\right] = -C_2\left[e^{\sqrt{\epsilon}\xi} - e^{\sqrt{\epsilon}(W - \xi)}\right] = C_2e^{\sqrt{\epsilon} W}\left[e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon}\xi} - e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon}(W - \xi)}\right],
$$

or

$$
C_1 = C_2e^{\sqrt{\epsilon} W}.
$$

Consequently,

$$
\mathcal{J}(\xi) = 1 + C_1\left[e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon}\xi} + e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon}(W - \xi)}\right],
$$

and substituting this expression into the governing equation at  $\xi = 0$  gives

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathcal{J}(0) = 1 + C_1(1 + e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon} W})}\\ & {\qquad = \epsilon +\frac{1}{2} (1 - \epsilon)\int_0^W{1 + C_1[e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon}\xi '} + e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon}(W - \xi ')}]} e^{-\xi ''}d\xi '}\\ & {\qquad = \epsilon +\frac{1}{2} (1 - \epsilon)\int_0^W{e^{-\xi '} + C_1[e^{-(1 + \sqrt{\epsilon})\xi '} + e^{-\xi '} - \sqrt{\epsilon}(W - \xi ')]} d\xi '}\\ & {\qquad = \epsilon -\frac{1}{2} (1 - \epsilon){e^{-\xi '} + C_1[\frac{e^{-(1 + \sqrt{\epsilon})\xi'}}{1 + \sqrt{\epsilon}} +\frac{e^{-\xi} - \sqrt{\epsilon}(W - \xi ')}{1 - \sqrt{\epsilon}}]} |_0^W}\\ & {\qquad = \epsilon +\frac{1}{2} (1 - \epsilon){1 - e^{-W} + C_1[\frac{1 - e^{-(1 + \sqrt{\epsilon})W}}{1 + \sqrt{\epsilon}} +\frac{e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon}W} - e^{-W}}{1 - \sqrt{\epsilon}}]} .} \end{array}
$$

$$

or

$$

and

$$

$$

Finally, the nondimensional heat flux follows as

$$
\Psi (\xi) = \frac{\epsilon}{1 - \epsilon} [1 - \mathcal{J}(\xi)] = \frac{\epsilon\left[e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon}\xi} + e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon}(W - \xi)}\right]}{(1 + \sqrt{\epsilon}) + (1 - \sqrt{\epsilon})e^{-\sqrt{\epsilon}W}},
$$

which is also included in Fig. 5- 15.

Note that  $e^{- |\xi ' - \xi |}$  is not a particularly good approximation for the kernel, since the actual kernel has a zero first derivative at  $\xi ' = \xi$ . A better approximation can be obtained by using

$$
K(\xi ,\xi^{\prime})\simeq a_{1}e^{-b_{1}|\xi^{\prime} - \xi |} + a_{2}e^{-b_{2}|\xi^{\prime} - \xi |}
$$

(with  $a_1 > 1$  and  $a_2 < 0$ ). If  $W$  is relatively small, say  $< \frac{1}{2}$ , a good approximation may be obtained using

$$
K(\xi ,\xi^{\prime})\simeq \cos a|\xi^{\prime} - \xi |
$$

(since the kernel has an inflection point at  $|\xi ' - \xi | = \frac{1}{2}$ ).

We shall conclude this chapter with two examples that demonstrate that exact analytical solutions are possible for a few simple geometries for which the view factors between area elements attain certain special forms.

Example 5.13. Consider a hemispherical cavity irradiated by the sun as shown in Fig. 5- 16. The surface of the cavity is kept isothermal at temperature  $T$  and is coated with a gray, diffuse material with emittance  $\epsilon$ . Assuming that the cavity is, aside from the solar irradiation, exposed to cold surroundings, determine the local heat flux rates that are necessary to maintain the cavity surface at constant temperature.

# Solution

From equation (5.24) the local radiosity at position  $(\phi ,\psi)$  is determined as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{J(\phi) = \epsilon \sigma T^4 +(1 - \epsilon)H(\phi)}\\ {= \epsilon \sigma T^4 +(1 - \epsilon)\left[\int_AJ(\phi ')dF_{dA - dA'} + H_o(\phi)\right],} \end{array}
$$

where we have already stated that radiosity is a function of  $\phi$  only, i.e., there is no dependence on azimuthal angle  $\psi$  . The view factor between infinitesimal areas on a sphere is known from the inside sphere method, equation (4.33), as

$$
dF_{dA - dA'} = \frac{dA'}{4\pi R^2} = \frac{R^2\sin\phi'd\phi'd\psi'}{4\pi R^2}.
$$

The external irradiation at  $dA$  is readily determined as  $H_{o}(\phi) = q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \phi ,$  and the expression for radiosity becomes

$$
\begin{array}{l}{J(\phi) = \epsilon \sigma T^4 +(1 - \epsilon)\left[\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi /2}J(\phi ')\frac{\sin\phi'd\phi'd\psi'}{4\pi} +q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \phi \right]}\\ {= \epsilon \sigma T^4 +\frac{1 - \epsilon}{2}\int_0^{\pi /2}J(\phi ')\sin \phi 'd\phi '(1 - \epsilon)q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \phi .} \end{array}
$$

Because of the unique behavior of view factors between sphere surface elements we note that the irradiation at location  $\phi$  that arrives from other parts of the sphere,  $H_{s},$  does not depend on  $\phi$  . Thus,

$$
H_{s} = \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{\pi /2}J(\phi^{\prime})\sin \phi^{\prime}d\phi^{\prime} = \mathrm{const},
$$

and

$$
J(\phi) = \epsilon \sigma T^4 +(1 - \epsilon)H_s + (1 - \epsilon)q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \phi .
$$

Substituting this equation into the expression for  $H_{s}$  leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{H_s = \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\pi /2}\left[\epsilon \sigma T^4 +(1 - \epsilon)H_s + (1 - \epsilon)q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \phi '\right]\sin \phi 'd\phi '}\\ {= \frac{1}{2}\epsilon \sigma T^4 +\frac{1}{2} (1 - \epsilon)H_s + \frac{1}{4} (1 - \epsilon)q_{\mathrm{sun}},} \end{array}
$$

or

$$
H_{s} = \frac{\epsilon}{1 + \epsilon}\sigma T^{4} + \frac{1 - \epsilon}{2(1 + \epsilon)} q_{\mathrm{sun}}.
$$

An energy balance at  $dA$  gives

or

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q(\phi) = \epsilon \sigma T^4 -\epsilon H(\phi) = \epsilon (\sigma T^4 -H_s - q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \phi)}\\ {}\\ {q(\phi) = \epsilon \left[\frac{\sigma T^4}{1 + \epsilon} -\left(\frac{1 - \epsilon}{2(1 + \epsilon)} +\cos \phi\right)q_{\mathrm{sun}}\right].} \end{array}
$$

We observe from this example that in problems where all radiating surfaces are part of a sphere, none of the view factors involved depend on the location of the originating surface, and an exact analytical solution can always be found in a similar fashion. Apparently, this was first recognized by Jensen [24] and reported in the book by Jakob [25].

Exact analytical solutions are also possible for such configurations where all relevant view factors have repeating derivatives (as in the kernel approximation).

Example 5.14. A long thin radiating wire is to be employed as an infrared light source. To maximize the output of infrared energy into the desired direction, the wire is fitted with an insulated, highly reflective sheath as shown in Fig. 5- 17. The sheath is cylindrical with radius  $R$  (which is much larger than the diameter of the wire), and has a cutout of half- angle  $\phi$  to let the concentrated infrared light escape. Assuming that the wire is heated with a power of  $Q^{\prime} \mathrm{W / m}$  length of wire, and that the sheath

can lose heat only by radiation and only from its inside surface, determine the temperature distribution across the sheath.

# Solution

From an energy balance on a surface element  $dA$  it follows from equation (5.20) that, with  $q(\theta) = 0$ ,

$$
\sigma T^4 (\theta) = J(\theta) = H(\theta),
$$

and

$$
H(\theta) = \int_{A}J(\theta^{\prime})dF_{dA - dA^{\prime}} + H_{o}(\theta).
$$

We may treat the energy emitted from the wire as external radiation (neglecting absorption by the wire since it is so small). Since the total released energy will spread equally into all directions, we find

$$
H_{o}(\theta) = Q^{\prime} / 2\pi R = \mathrm{const.}
$$

The view factor  $dF_{dA - dA'}$  between two infinitely long strips on the cylinder surface is given by Configuration 1 in Appendix D as

$$
\begin{array}{r}F_{dA - dA'} = \frac{1}{2}\cos \beta d\beta , \end{array}
$$

where the angle  $\beta$  is indicated in Fig. 5- 17 and may be related to  $\theta$  through

$$
2\beta +|\theta^{\prime} - \theta | = \pi .
$$

Differentiating  $\beta$  with respect to  $\theta '$  we obtain  $d\beta = \pm d\theta ' / 2$ , depending on whether  $\theta '$  is larger or less than  $\theta$ . Substituting for  $\beta$  in the view factor, this becomes

$$
F_{dA - dA^{\prime}} = \frac{1}{2}\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2} -\left|\frac{\theta^{\prime} - \theta}{2}\right|\right)\frac{1}{2} d\theta^{\prime} = \frac{1}{4}\sin \left|\frac{\theta^{\prime} - \theta}{2}\right|d\theta^{\prime},
$$

where the  $\pm$  has been omitted since the view factor is always positive (i.e.,  $|d\beta |$  is to be used). Substituting this into the above relationship for radiosity we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l}{J(\theta) = \frac{1}{4}\int_{-\pi +\phi}^{\pi -\phi}J(\theta^{\prime})\sin \left|\frac{\theta^{\prime} - \theta}{2}\right|d\theta^{\prime} + H_{o}}\\ {= \frac{1}{4}\int_{-\pi +\phi}^{\theta}J(\theta^{\prime})\sin \frac{\theta - \theta^{\prime}}{2} d\theta^{\prime} + \frac{1}{4}\int_{\theta}^{\pi -\phi}J(\theta^{\prime})\sin \frac{\theta^{\prime} - \theta}{2} d\theta^{\prime} + H_{o}.} \end{array}
$$

Since the view factor in the integrand has repetitive derivatives we may convert this integral equation into a second- order differential equation, as was done in the kernel approximation method. Differentiating

twice, we have

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\frac{dJ}{d\theta} = \frac{1}{8}\int_{-\pi +\phi}^{\theta}J(\theta^{\prime})\cos \frac{\theta - \theta^{\prime}}{2} d\theta^{\prime} - \frac{1}{8}\int_{\theta}^{\pi -\phi}J(\theta^{\prime})\cos \frac{\theta^{\prime} - \theta}{2} d\theta^{\prime},}\\ {\frac{d^{2}J}{d\theta^{2}} = \frac{1}{8} J(\theta) - \frac{1}{16}\int_{-\pi +\phi}^{\theta}J(\theta^{\prime})\sin \frac{\theta - \theta^{\prime}}{2} d\theta^{\prime} + \frac{1}{8} J(\theta) - \frac{1}{16}\int_{\theta}^{\pi -\phi}J(\theta^{\prime})\sin \frac{\theta^{\prime} - \theta}{2} d\theta^{\prime}.} \end{array}
$$

Comparing this result with the above integral equation for  $J(\theta)$  we find

$$
\frac{d^2J}{d\theta^2} = \frac{1}{4} J(\theta) - \frac{1}{4} J(J(\theta) - H_o] = \frac{1}{4} H_o.
$$

This equation is readily solved as

$$
\begin{array}{r}J(\theta) = \frac{1}{8} H_{o}\theta^{2} + C_{1}\theta +C_{2}. \end{array}
$$

The two integration constants must now be determined by substituting the solution back into the governing integral equation. However,  $C_1$  may be determined from symmetry since, for this problem,  $J(\theta) = J(- \theta)$  and  $C_1 = 0$ . To determine  $C_2$  we evaluate  $J$  at  $\theta = 0$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l}{J(0) = C_2 = \frac{1}{4}\int_{-\pi +\phi}^0 J(\theta ')\sin \left(-\frac{\theta'}{2}\right)d\theta ' + \frac{1}{4}\int_0^{\pi -\phi}J(\theta ')\sin \frac{\theta'}{2} d\theta ' + H_o}\\ {= \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\pi -\phi}J(\theta ')\sin \frac{\theta'}{2} d\theta ' + H_o}\\ {= \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\pi -\phi}\left(C_2 + \frac{H_o}{8}\theta '^2\right)\sin \frac{\theta'}{2} d\theta ' + H_o.} \end{array}
$$

Integrating twice by parts we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l}{C_2 = H_o - \left(C_2 + \frac{H_o}{8}\theta '^2\right)\cos \frac{\theta'}{2}\bigg|_0^{\pi -\phi} + \frac{H_o}{4}\int_0^{\pi -\phi}\theta '\cos \frac{\theta'}{2} d\theta '}\\ {= H_o - \left[C_2 + \frac{H_o}{8} (\pi -\phi)^2\right]\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2} -\frac{\phi}{2}\right) + C_2 + \frac{H_o}{2}\left(\theta '\sin \frac{\theta'}{2}\bigg|_0^{\pi -\phi} - \int_0^{\pi -\phi}\sin \frac{\theta'}{2} d\theta '\right)}\\ {= H_o + C_2 - \left[C_2 + \frac{H_o}{8} (\pi -\phi)^2\right]\sin \frac{\phi}{2} +\frac{H_o}{2}\left((\pi -\phi)\sin \left(\frac{\pi}{2} -\frac{\phi}{2}\right) + 2\cos \frac{\theta'}{2}\bigg|_0^{\pi -\phi}\right)}\\ {= H_o + C_2 - \left[C_2 + \frac{H_o}{8} (\pi -\phi)^2\right]\sin \frac{\phi}{2} +\frac{H_o}{2} (\pi -\phi)\cos \frac{\phi}{2} +H_o\sin \frac{\phi}{2} -H_o.} \end{array}
$$

Solving this equation for  $C_2$  we get

$$
C_2 = H_o\left[1 + \frac{\pi - \phi}{2}\cos \frac{\phi}{2} -\frac{1}{8} (\pi -\phi)^2\right].
$$

Therefore,

$$
T^4 (\theta) = \frac{J}{\sigma} = \frac{Q'}{2\pi R\sigma}\left\{1 + \frac{\pi - \phi}{2}\cos \frac{\phi}{2} -\frac{1}{8}\left[(\pi - \phi)^2 -\theta^2\right]\right\} .
$$

We find that the temperature has a minimum at  $\theta = 0$ , since around that location the view factor to the opening is maximum, resulting in a maximum of escaping energy. The temperature level increases as  $\phi$  decreases (since less energy can escape) and reaches  $T \to \infty$  as  $\phi = 0$  (since this produces an insulated closed enclosure with internal heat production).

The fact that long cylindrical surfaces lend themselves to exact analysis was apparently first recognized by Sparrow [26]. The preceding two examples have shown that exact solutions may be found for a number of special geometries, namely, (i) enclosures whose surfaces all lie on a single sphere, and (ii) enclosures for which view factors between surface elements have repetitive derivatives. For other still fairly simple geometries an approximate analytical solution may be determined from the kernel approximation method. However, the vast majority of radiative heat

transfer problems in enclosures without a participating medium must be solved by numerical methods. A large majority of these are solved using the net radiation method described in the first few sections of this chapter. If greater accuracy or better numerical efficiency is desired, one of the numerical methods briefly described in this section needs to be used, such as numerical quadrature leading to a set of linear algebraic equations (as in the net radiation method).

5.1 A firefighter (approximated by a two- sided black surface at 310 K 180 cm long and 40 cm wide) is facing a large fire at a distance of 10 m (approximated by a semi- infinite black surface at 1500 K). Ground and sky are at  $0^\circ \mathrm{C}$  (and may also be approximated as black). What are the net radiative

heat fluxes on the front and back of the firefighter? Compare these with heat rates by free convection  $(h = 10\mathrm{W / m^2K},T_{\mathrm{amb}} = 0^\circ \mathrm{C})$ .

5.2 A small furnace consists of a cylindrical, black- walled enclosure,  $20\mathrm{cm}$  long and with a diameter of  $10\mathrm{cm}$ . The bottom surface is electrically heated to  $1500\mathrm{K}$ , while the cylindrical sidewall is insulated. The top plate is exposed to the environment, such that its temperature is  $500\mathrm{K}$ . Estimate the heating requirements for the bottom wall, and the temperature of the cylindrical sidewall, by treating the sidewall as  $(a)$  a single zone,  $(b)$  two equal rings of  $10\mathrm{cm}$  height each.

5.3 Repeat Problem 5.2 for a  $20\mathrm{cm}$  high furnace of quadratic  $(10\mathrm{cm}\times 10\mathrm{cm})$  cross- section.

5.4 A small star has a radius of  $100,000\mathrm{km}$ . Suppose that the star is originally at a uniform temperature of  $1,000,000\mathrm{K}$  before it "dies," i.e., before nuclear fusion stops supplying heat. If it is assumed that the star has a constant heat capacity of  $\rho c_{p} = 1\mathrm{kJ / m^3K}$ , and that it remains isothermal during cool- down, estimate the time required until the star has cooled to  $10,000\mathrm{K}$ . Note: A body of such proportions radiates like a blackbody (Why?).

5.5 A collimated light beam of  $q_{0} = 10\mathrm{W / cm^{2}}$  originating from a blackbody source at  $1250\mathrm{K}$  is aimed at a small target  $A_{1} = 1\mathrm{cm}^{2}$  as shown. The target is coated with a diffusely reflecting material, whose emittance is

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0.9\cos \theta , & \lambda < 4\mu \mathrm{m},\\ 0.2, & \lambda >4\mu \mathrm{m}. \end{array} \right.
$$

Light reflected from  $A_{1}$  travels on to a detector  $A_{2} = 1\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ , coated with the same material as  $A_{1}$ . How much of the collimated energy  $q_{0}$  is absorbed by detector  $A_{2}$ ?

All configurations are gray and diffuse.

5.10 Two pipes carrying hot combustion gases are enclosed in a cylindrical duct as shown. Assuming both pipes to be isothermal at  $2000\mathrm{K}$  and diffusely emitting and reflecting  $(\epsilon = 0.5)$  and the duct wall to be isothermal at  $500\mathrm{K}$  and diffusely emitting and reflecting  $(\epsilon = 0.2)$ , determine the radiative heat loss from the pipes.

5.11 A cubical enclosure has gray, diffuse walls which interchange energy. Four of the walls are isothermal at  $T_{\mathrm{a}}$  with emittance  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{e}}$ , the other two are isothermal at  $T_{1}$  with emittance  $\epsilon_{1}$ .

During orbit the doors are opened and the panels are rotated out by an angle  $\phi$  as shown in the figure. Assuming door and panel can be approximated by infinitely long, isothermal quarter- cylinders of radius  $a$  and emittance  $\epsilon = 0.8$ , calculate the necessary rotation angle  $\phi$  so that half the total energy emitted by panel (2) and door (1) escapes through the opening. At what opening angle will a maximum amount of energy be rejected? How much and why?

5.13 Consider two  $1\times 1\mathrm{m}^2$ , thin, gray, diffuse plates located a distance  $h = 1\mathrm{m}$  apart. The temperature of the top plate is maintained at  $T_{1} = 1200\mathrm{K}$ , whereas the bottom plate is initially at  $T_{2} = 300\mathrm{K}$  and insulated on the outside. In case 1, the surface of the top plate is flat, whereas in case 2 grooves, whose dimensions are indicated below, have been machined in the plate's surface. In either case the surfaces are gray and diffuse, and the surroundings may be considered as black and having a temperature  $T_{\infty} = 500\mathrm{K}$ ; convective heat transfer effects may be neglected.

(a) Estimate the effect of the surface preparation of the top surface on the initial temperature change of the bottom plate  $(dT_{2} / dt$  at  $t = 0)$  
(b) Justify, then use, a lumped-capacity analysis for the bottom plate to predict the history of temperature and heating rates of the bottom plate until steady state is reached.

The following properties are known: top plate:  $\epsilon_{1} = 0.6,T_{1} = 1200\mathrm{K};$  bottom plate:  $T_{2}(t = 0) = 300\mathrm{K},$ $\epsilon_{2} = 0.5,$ $\rho_{2} = 800\mathrm{kg / m^{3}}(density),$ $c_{p2} = 440\mathrm{J / kgK},$ $k_{2} = 200\mathrm{W / mK}$

5.14 A row of equally spaced, cylindrical heating elements  $(s = 2d)$  is used to heat the inside of a furnace as shown. Assuming that the outer wall is made of firebrick with  $\epsilon_{3} = 0.3$  and is perfectly insulated, that the heating rods are made of silicon carbide  $(\epsilon_{1} = 0.8)$ , and that the inner wall has an emittance of  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.6$ , what must the operating temperature of the rods be to supply a net heat flux of  $300\mathrm{kW / m^2}$  to the furnace, if the inner wall is at a temperature of  $1300\mathrm{K}$ ?

5.15 A thermocouple used to measure the temperature of cold, low- pressure helium flowing through a long duct shows a temperature reading of  $10\mathrm{K}$ . To minimize heat losses from the duct to the surroundings the duct is made of two concentric thin layers of stainless steel with an evacuated space in between (inner diameter  $d_{i} = 2\mathrm{cm}$ , outer diameter  $d_{o} = 2.5\mathrm{cm}$ ; stainless layers very thin and of high conductivity). The emittance of the thermocouple is  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{TC}} = 0.6$ , the convection heat transfer coefficient between helium and tube wall is  $h_{i} = 5\mathrm{W / m^2K}$ , and between thermocouple and helium is  $h_{\mathrm{TC}} = 2\mathrm{W / m^2K}$ , and the emittance of the stainless steel is  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{ss}} = 0.2$  (gray and diffuse, all four surfaces). The free convection heat transfer coefficient between the outer tube and the surroundings at  $T_{\mathrm{amb}} = 300\mathrm{K}$  is  $h_{o} = 5\mathrm{W / m^2K}$ .

(a) Prepare an energy balance for the thermocouple. 
(b) Prepare an energy balance for the heat loss through the duct wall (the only unknowns here should be  $T_{\mathrm{He}},T_{i},$  and  $T_{o}$  
(c) Outline how to solve for the temperature of the helium (no need to carry out solution). 
(d) Do you expect the thermocouple to be accurate? (Hint: Check the magnitudes of the terms in (a).)

5.16 During a materials processing experiment on the Space Shuttle (under microgravity conditions), a platinum sphere of  $3\mathrm{mm}$  diameter is levitated in a large, cold black vacuum chamber. A spherical aluminum shield (with a circular cutout) is placed around the sphere as shown, to reduce heat loss from the sphere. Initially, the sphere is at  $200\mathrm{K}$  and is suddenly irradiated with a laser providing an irradiation of  $100\mathrm{W}$  (normal to beam) to raise its temperature rapidly to its melting point  $(2741\mathrm{K})$ . Determine the time required to reach the melting point. You may assume the platinum and aluminum to be gray and diffuse  $(\epsilon_{P i} = 0.25,\epsilon_{A l} = 0.1)$ , the sphere to be essentially isothermal at all times, and the shield to have zero heat capacity.

5.17 Two identical circular disks are connected at one point of their periphery by a hinge. The configuration is then opened by an angle  $\phi$  as shown in the figure. Assuming the opening angle to be  $\phi = 60^{\circ}$ ,  $d = 1\mathrm{m}$ , calculate the average equilibrium temperature for each of the two disks, with solar radiation entering the configuration parallel to Disk 2 with a strength of  $q_{\mathrm{sun}} = 1000\mathrm{W / m^2}$ . Disk 1 is gray and diffuse with  $\alpha = \epsilon = 0.5$ , Disk 2 is black. Both disks are insulated.

5.18 A long greenhouse has the cross- section of an equilateral triangle as shown. The side exposed to the sun consists of a thin sheet of glass  $(A_{1})$  with reflectivity  $\rho_{1} = 0.1$ . The glass may be assumed perfectly transparent to solar radiation, and totally opaque to radiation emitted inside the greenhouse. The other side wall  $(A_{2})$  is opaque with emittance  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.2$ , while the floor  $(A_{3})$  has  $\epsilon_{3} = 0.8$ . All surfaces reflect diffusely. For simplicity, you may assume surfaces  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  to be perfectly insulated, while the floor loses heat to the ground according to

$$
q_{3,\mathrm{conduction}} = U(T_3 - T_\infty)
$$

where  $T_{\infty} = 280\mathrm{K}$  is the temperature of the ground, and  $U = 19.5\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{K}$  is an overall heat transfer coefficient. Determine the temperatures of all three surfaces for the case that the sun shines onto the greenhouse with strength  $q_{\mathrm{sun}} = 1000\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{m}^2$  in a direction parallel to surface  $A_{2}$ .

5.19 A long, black  $\mathbb{V}$ - groove is irradiated by the sun as shown. Assuming the groove to be perfectly insulated, and radiation to be the only mode of heat transfer, determine the average groove temperature as a function of solar incidence angle  $\theta$  (give values for  $\theta = 0^{\circ}$ ,  $15^{\circ}$ ,  $30^{\circ}$ ,  $60^{\circ}$ ,  $90^{\circ}$ ). For simplicity the  $\mathbb{V}$ - groove wall may be taken as a single zone.

5.20 Consider the conical cavity shown (radius of opening  $R$ , opening angle  $\gamma = 30^{\circ}$ ), which has a gray, diffusely reflective coating  $(\epsilon = 0.6)$  and is perfectly insulated. The cavity is irradiated by a collimated beam of strength  $H_{0}$  and radius  $R_{b} = 0.5R$ .

(a) Using a single node analysis, develop an expression relating  $H_{0}$  to the average cavity temperature  $T$ .

(b) For a more accurate analysis a two-node analysis is to be performed. What nodes would you choose? Develop expressions for the necessary view factors in terms of known ones (including those given in App. D) and surface areas, then relate the two temperatures to  $H_{0}$ .

(c) Qualitatively, what happens to the cavity's overall average temperature, if the beam is turned away by an angle  $\alpha$ ?

5.21 A (simplified) radiation heat flux meter consists of a conical cavity coated with a gray, diffuse material, as shown in the figure. To measure the radiative heat flux, the cavity is perfectly insulated.

(b) If the cavity is turned away from the incoming flux by an angle  $\alpha$ , what happens to the cavity temperature?

5.22 A very long solar collector plate is to collect energy at a temperature of  $T_{1} = 350\mathrm{K}$ . To improve its performance for off- normal solar incidence, a highly reflective surface is placed next to the collector as shown in the adjacent figure. How much energy (per unit length) does the collector plate collect for a solar incidence angle of  $30^{\circ}$ ? For simplicity you may make the following assumptions: The collector is isothermal and gray- diffuse with emittance  $\epsilon_{1} = 0.8$ ; the reflector is gray- diffuse with  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.1$ , and heat losses from the reflector by convection as well as all losses from the collector ends may be neglected.

5.23 A thermocouple (approximated by a  $1\mathrm{mm}$  diameter sphere with gray- diffuse emittance  $\epsilon_{1} = 0.5$  is suspended inside a tube through which a hot, nonparticipating gas at  $T_{g} = 2000\mathrm{K}$  is flowing. In the vicinity of the thermocouple the tube temperature is known to be  $T_{2} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  (wall emittance  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.5$ ). For the purpose of this problem you may assume both ends of the tube to be closed with a black surface at the temperature of the gas,  $T_{3} = 2000\mathrm{K}$ . Again, for the purpose of this problem, you may assume that the thermocouple gains a heat flux of  $10^{4}\mathrm{W / m^2}$  of thermocouple surface area, which it must reject again in the form of radiation. Estimate the temperature of the thermocouple. Hints:

(a) Treat the tube ends together as a single surface  $A_{3}$ .  
(b) Note that the thermocouple is small, i.e.,  $F_{x - 1} \ll 1$ .

5.24 A small spherical heat source outputting  $Q_{s} = 10\mathrm{kW}$  power, spreading equally into all directions, is encased in a reflector as shown, consisting of a hemisphere of radius  $R = 40\mathrm{cm}$ , plus a ring of radius  $R$  and height  $h = 30\mathrm{cm}$ . The arrangement is used to heat a disk of radius  $= 25\mathrm{cm}$  a distance of  $L = 30\mathrm{cm}$  below the reflector. All surfaces are gray and diffuse, with emittances of  $\epsilon_{1} = 0.8$  and  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.1$ . Reflector  $A_{2}$  is insulated.

(a) Determine (per unit area of receiving surface) the irradiation from heat source to reflector and to disk;  
(b) all relevant view factors; and  
(c) the temperature of the disk, if  $0.4\mathrm{kW}$  of power is extracted from the disk.

5.25 A long thin black heating wire radiates  $300\mathrm{W}$  per cm length of wire and is used to heat a flat surface by thermal radiation. To increase its efficiency the wire is surrounded by an insulated half- cylinder as shown in the figure. Both surfaces are gray and diffuse with emittances  $\epsilon_{2}$  and  $\epsilon_{3}$ , respectively. What is the net heat flux at Surface 3? How does this compare with the case without cylinder?

Hint: You may either treat the heating wire as a thin cylinder whose radius you eventually shrink to zero, or treat radiation from the wire as external radiation (the second approach being somewhat simpler).

5.26 Consider the configuration shown, consisting of a cylindrical cavity  $A_{2}$ , a circular disk  $A_{1}$  at the bottom, and a small spherical radiation source (blackbody at  $4000\mathrm{K}$ ) of strength  $Q = 10,000\mathrm{W}$  as shown ( $R = 10\mathrm{cm}$ ,  $h = 10\mathrm{cm}$ ). The cylinder wall  $A_{2}$  is covered with a gray, diffuse material with  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.1$ , and is perfectly insulated. Surface  $A_{1}$  is kept at a constant temperature of  $400\mathrm{K}$ . No other external surfaces or sources affect the heat transfer. Assuming surface  $A_{1}$  to be gray and diffuse with  $\epsilon_{1} = 0.3$  determine the amount of heat that needs to be removed from  $A_{1}$  ( $Q_{1}$ ).

5.27 Determine  $F_{1 - 2}$  for the rotationally symmetric configuration shown in the figure (i.e., a big sphere,  $R = 13\mathrm{cm}$ , with a circular hole,  $r = 5\mathrm{cm}$ , and a hemispherical cavity,  $r = 5\mathrm{cm}$ ). Assuming Surface 2 to be gray and diffuse  $(\epsilon = 0.5)$  and insulated and Surface 1 to be black and also insulated, what is the average temperature of the black cavity if collimated irradiation of  $1000\mathrm{W / m^2}$  is penetrating through the hole as shown?

5.28 An integrating sphere (a device to measure surface properties) is  $10\mathrm{cm}$  in radius. It contains on its inside wall a  $1\mathrm{cm^2}$  black detector, a  $1\times 2\mathrm{cm}$  entrance port, and a  $1\times 1\mathrm{cm}$  sample as shown. The remaining portion of the sphere is smoked with magnesium oxide having a short- wavelength reflectance of 0.98, which is almost perfectly diffuse. A collimated beam of radiant energy (i.e., all energy is contained within a very small cone of solid angles) enters the sphere through the entrance port, falls onto the sample, and then is reflected and interreflected, giving rise to a sphere wall radiosity and irradiation. Radiation emitted from the walls is not detected because the source radiation is chopped, and the detector- amplifier system responds only to the chopped radiation. Find the fractions of the chopped incoming radiation that are

(a) lost out the entrance port,  
(b) absorbed by the  $\mathrm{MgO}$ -smoked wall, and  
(c) absorbed by the detector.

5.29 The side wall of a flask holding liquid helium may be approximated as a long double- walled cylinder as shown in the adjacent sketch. The container walls are made of  $1\mathrm{mm}$  thick stainless steel  $(k = 15\mathrm{W / mK}, \epsilon = 0.2)$ , and have outer radii of  $R_{2} = 10\mathrm{cm}$  and  $R_{4} = 11\mathrm{cm}$ . The space between walls is evacuated, and the outside is exposed to free convection with the ambient at  $T_{\mathrm{amb}} = 20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and a heat transfer coefficient of  $h_{o} = 10\mathrm{W / m^2K}$  (for the combined effects of free convection and radiation). It is reasonable to assume that the temperature of the inner wall is at liquid helium temperature, or  $T(R_{2}) = 4\mathrm{K}$ .

(a) Determine the heat gain by the helium, per unit length of flask.  
(b) To reduce the heat gain a thin silver foil  $(\epsilon = 0.02)$  is placed midway between the two walls. How does this affect the heat flux?

For the sake of the problem, you may assume both steel and silver to be diffuse reflectors.

5.30 Repeat Problem 5.6, breaking up the sidewall into four equal ring elements. Use the view factors calculated in Problem 4.25 together with program graydiffxch of Appendix F.

5.31 The inside surfaces of a furnace in the shape of a parallelepiped with dimensions  $1\mathrm{m}\times 2\mathrm{m}\times 4\mathrm{m}$  are to be broken up into  $28.1\mathrm{m}\times 1\mathrm{m}$  subareas. The gray- diffuse side walls (of dimension  $1\mathrm{m}\times 2\mathrm{m}$  and  $1\mathrm{m}\times 4\mathrm{m}$ ) have emittances of  $\epsilon_{s} = 0.7$  and are perfectly insulated, the bottom surface has an emittance of  $\epsilon_{b} = 0.9$  and a temperature  $T_{b} = 1600\mathrm{K}$ , while the top's emittance is  $\epsilon_{t} = 0.2$  and its temperature is  $T_{t} = 500\mathrm{K}$ . Using the view factors calculated in Problem 4.26 and program graydiffxch of Appendix

![](images/fd76aec4c27343b1aeaf70a92413d306fc1b92d6dc002d9049248d6c3ee71446.jpg)

5.32 For your Memorial Day barbecue you would like to broil a steak on your backyard BBQ, which consists of a base unit in the shape of a hemisphere  $(D = 60\mathrm{cm})$ , fitted with a disk- shaped coal rack, and a disk- shaped grill, as shown in the sketch. Hot coal may be assumed to cover the entire floor of the unit, with uniform temperature  $T_{c} = 1200\mathrm{K}$ , and an emittance of  $\epsilon_{c} = 1$ . The side wall is soot- covered and black on the inside, but has an outside emittance of  $\epsilon_{o} = 0.5$ . The steak (modeled as a  $u_{s} = 15\mathrm{cm}$  disk,  $1\mathrm{cm}$  thick, emittance  $\epsilon_{s} = 0.8$ , initially at  $T_{s} = 280\mathrm{K}$ ) is now placed on the grill (assumed to be so lightweight as to be totally transparent and not participating in the heat transfer). The environment is at  $300\mathrm{K}$ , and free convection may be neglected.

(b) How would the heating rates change, if the lid (also a hemisphere) is put on  $(\epsilon_{i} = \epsilon_{o} = 0.5)$ ? Could one achieve a more even heating rate (top and bottom) if the emittance of the inside surface is increased or decreased?

Note: Part  $(b)$  will be quite tedious, unless program graydiffxch of Appendix F is used (which, in turn, will require iteration on a little trickery).

5.33 Consider Configuration 33 in Appendix D with  $h = w$ . The bottom wall is at constant temperature  $T_{1}$  and has emittance  $\epsilon_{1}$ ; the side wall is at  $T_{2} = \text{const}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$ . Find the exact expression for  $q_{1}(x)$  if  $\epsilon_{2} = 1$ .

# CHAPTER 6

# RADIATIVE EXCHANGE BETWEEN PARTIALLY SPECULAR GRAY SURFACES

# 6.1 INTRODUCTION

In the previous two chapters it was assumed that all surfaces constituting the enclosure are- - besides being gray- - diffuse emitters as well as diffuse reflectors of radiant energy. Diffuse emission is nearly always an acceptable simplification. The assumption of diffuse reflection, on the other hand, often leads to considerable error, since many surfaces deviate substantially from this behavior. Electromagnetic wave theory predicts reflection to be specular for optically smooth surfaces, i.e., to reflect light like a mirror. All clean metals, many nonmetals such as glassy materials, and most polished materials display strong specular reflection peaks. Nevertheless, they all, to some extent, reflect somewhat into other directions as a result of their surface roughness. Surfaces may appear dull (i.e., diffusely reflecting) to the eye, but are rather specular in the infrared, since the ratio of every surface's root- mean- square roughness to wavelength decreases with increasing wavelength.

For a surface with diffuse reflectance the reflected radiation has the same (diffuse) directional distribution as the emitted energy, as discussed in the beginning of Section 5.3. Therefore, the radiation field within the enclosure is completely specified in terms of the radiosity, which is a function of location along the enclosure walls (but not a function of direction as well). If reflection is nondiffuse, then the radiation intensities leaving any surface are functions of direction as well as surface location, and the analysis becomes immensely more complicated.1 To make the analysis tractable, one may make the idealization that the reflectance, while not diffuse, can be adequately represented by a combination of a diffuse and a specular component, as illustrated in Fig. 6- 1 for oxidized brass [1]. Thus, for the present chapter, we assume the radiative properties to be of the form

$$
\rho = \rho^{s} + \rho^{d} = 1 - \alpha = 1 - \epsilon = 1 - \epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}, \tag{6.1}
$$

where  $\rho^s$  and  $\rho^d$  are the specular and diffuse components of the reflectance, respectively. Since the surfaces are assumed to be gray, diffuse emitters  $(\epsilon = \epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime})$  , it follows that neither  $\alpha$  nor  $\rho$

![](images/84128f8fa0045d0c6a8f2c72a6004ccdcac95a5c5cc89bc85e7286125b5b96b8.jpg)  
FIGURE 6-1 (a) Subdivision of the reflectance of oxidized brass (shown for plane of incidence) into specular (shaded) and diffuse components (unshaded), from [1]; (b) equivalent idealized reflectance.

may depend on wavelength or on incoming direction (i.e., the magnitude of  $\rho$  does not depend on incoming direction); how  $\rho$  is distributed over outgoing directions depends on incoming direction through  $\rho^s$ . With this approximation, the separate reflection components may be found analytically by splitting the bidirectional reflection function into two parts,

$$
\rho^{d^s}(\tau ,\hat{\theta}_r,\hat{\theta}_r) = \rho^{d^s}(\tau ,\hat{\theta}_r,\hat{\theta}_r) + \rho^{d^d}(\tau ,\hat{\theta}_r,\hat{\theta}_r). \tag{6.2}
$$

Substituting this expression into equation (3.43) and equation (3.46) then leads to  $\rho^s$  and  $\rho^d$ . Values of  $\rho^s$  and  $\rho^d$  may also be determined directly from experiment, as reported by Birkebak and coworkers [2], making detailed measurements of the bidirectional reflection function unnecessary.

Within an enclosure consisting of surfaces with purely diffuse and purely specular reflection components, the complexity of the problem may be reduced considerably by realizing that any specularly reflected beam may be traced back to a point on the enclosure surface from which it emanated diffusely (i.e., any beam was part of an energy stream leaving the surface after emission or diffuse reflection), as illustrated in Fig. 6- 2. Therefore, by redefining the view factors to include specular reflection paths in addition to direct view, the radiation field may again be described by a diffuse energy function that is a function of surface location but not of direction.

# 6.2 SPECULAR VIEW FACTORS

To accommodate surfaces with reflectances described by equation (6.1), we define a specular view factor as

$$
dF_{dA_i - dA_j}^s\equiv \frac{\mathrm{diffuse~energy~leaving}dA_i\mathrm{~intercepted~by}dA_j,\mathrm{~by}}{\mathrm{direct~travel~or~any~number~of~specular~reflections}}. \tag{6.3}
$$

The concept of the specular view factor is illustrated in Figs. 6- 2 and 6- 3. Diffuse radiation leaving  $dA_{i}$  (by emission or diffuse reflection) can reach  $dA_{j}$  either directly or after one or more reflections. Usually only a finite number of specular reflection paths such as  $dA_{i} - a - dA_{j}$  or  $dA_{i} - b - c - dA_{j}$  (and others not indicated in the figure) will be possible. The surface at points

![](images/90fef97854ee4e33975d0f009d1af2883f440728a2953e0c64a6602c63ba95b2.jpg)  
FIGURE 6-3 Specular view factor between infinitesimal surface elements; formation of images.

$a,b,$  and  $c$  behaves like a perfect mirror as far as the specular part of the reflection is concerned. Therefore, if an observer stood on top of  $dA_{j}$  looking toward  $c,$  it would appear as if point  $b$  as well as  $dA_{i}$  were situated behind point  $c$  as indicated in Fig. 6- 3; the point labeled  $b(c)$  is the image of point  $b$  as mirrored by the surface at  $c,$  and  $dA_{i}(cb)$  is the image of  $dA_{i}$  as mirrored by the surfaces at  $c$  and  $b$  . Therefore, as we examine Figs. 6- 2 and 6- 3, we may formally evaluate the specular view factor between two infinitesimal areas as

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & dF_{dA_i - dA_j}^s = dF_{dA_i - dA_j} + \rho_a^s dF_{dA_i(a) - dA_j} + \rho_b^s\rho_c^s dF_{dA_i(b) - dA_j}\\ & \qquad +\mathrm{other~possible~reflection~paths.} \end{array} \tag{6.4}
$$

Thus, the specular view factor may be expressed as a sum of diffuse view factors, with one contribution for each possible direct or reflection path. Note that, for images, the diffuse view factors must be multiplied by the specular reflectances of the mirroring surfaces, since radiation traveling from  $dA_{i}$  to  $dA_{j}$  is attenuated by every reflection.

If all specularly reflecting parts of the enclosure are flat, then all images of  $dA_{i}$  have the same shape and size as  $dA_{i}$  itself. However, curved surfaces tend to distort the images (focusing and defocusing effects). In the case of only flat, specularly reflecting surfaces we may multiply equation (6.4) by  $dA_{i}$  and, invoking the law of reciprocity for diffuse view factors, equation (4.7), we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & dA_{i}dF_{dA_{i} - dA_{j}}^{s} = dA_{j}dF_{dA_{j} - dA_{i}} + \rho_{a}^{s}dA_{j}dF_{dA_{j} - dA_{i}(a)} + \rho_{b}^{s}\rho_{c}^{s}dA_{j}dF_{dA_{j} - dA_{i}(bc)}\\ & \qquad = dA_{j}dF_{dA_{j} - dA_{i}} + \rho_{a}^{s}dA_{j}dF_{dA_{j}(a) - dA_{i}} + \rho_{b}^{s}\rho_{c}^{s}dA_{j}dF_{dA_{j}(bc) - dA_{i}} + \ldots \\ & \qquad = dA_{j}dF_{dA_{j} - dA_{i}}^{s}, \end{array} \tag{6.5}
$$

FIGURE 6-4(a) Geometry for Example 6.1, (b) ray tracing for the evaluation of  $F_{1 - 1}^{s}$  and  $F_{1 - 2}^{s}$ .

that is, the law of reciprocity holds for specular view factors as long as all specularly reflecting surfaces are flat. Although considerably more complicated, it is possible to show that the law of reciprocity also holds for curved specular reflectors. If we also assume that the diffuse energy leaving  $A_{i}$  and  $A_{j}$  is constant across each respective area, we have the equivalent to equation (4.15),

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {dA_{i}dF_{di - dj}^{s} = dA_{j}dF_{dj - di}^{s},}\\ & {dA_{i}F_{di - j}^{s} = A_{j}dF_{j - di}^{s},\qquad (J_{j} = \mathrm{const}),}\\ & {A_{i}F_{i - j}^{s} = A_{j}F_{j - i}^{s},\qquad (J_{i},J_{j} = \mathrm{const}),} \end{array} \tag{6.6b}
$$

where we have adopted the compact notation first introduced in Chapter 4, and  $J_{i}$  is the total diffuse energy (per unit area) leaving surface  $A_{i}$  (again called the radiosity).

Example 6.1. Evaluate the specular view factors  $F_{1 - 1}^{s}$  and  $F_{1 - 2}^{s}$  for the parallel plate geometry shown in Fig. 6- 4a.

# Solution

We note that, because of the one- dimensionality of the problem,  $F_{d1 - 2}^{s}$  must be the same for any  $dA_{1}$  on surface  $A_{1}$ . Since  $F_{1 - 2}^{s}$  is nothing but a surface average of  $F_{d1 - 2}^{s}$ , we conclude that  $F_{d1 - 2}^{s} = F_{1 - 2}^{s}$ . It is sufficient to consider energy leaving from an infinitesimal area (rather than all of  $A_{1}$ ). Examining Fig. 6- 4b we see that every beam (assumed to have unity strength) leaving  $dA_{1}$ , regardless of its direction, must travel to surface  $A_{2}$  (a beam of strength "1" is intercepted). After reflection at  $A_{2}$  a beam of strength  $\rho_{2}^{s}$  returns to  $A_{1}$  specularly, where it is reflected again and a beam of strength  $\rho_{2}^{s}\rho_{1}^{s}$  returns to  $A_{2}$  specularly. After one more reflection a beam of strength  $(\rho_{2}^{s}\rho_{1}^{s})\rho_{2}^{s}$  returns to  $A_{1}$ , and so on. Thus, the specular view factor may be evaluated as

$$
F_{1 - 2}^{s} = F_{1 - 2}^{s} = 1 + \rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s} + (\rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s})^{2} + (\rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s})^{3} + \ldots . \tag{6.7}
$$

Since  $\rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s}< 1$  the sum in this equation is readily evaluated by the methods given in Wylie [3], and

$$
F_{1 - 2}^{s} = \frac{1}{1 - \rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s}} = F_{2 - 1}^{s}. \tag{6.8}
$$

The last part of this relation is found by switching subscripts or by invoking reciprocity (and  $A_{1} = A_{2}$ ). We notice that specular view factors are not limited to values between zero and one, but are often greater than unity because much of the radiative energy leaving a surface is accounted for more than once. All energy from  $A_{1}$  is intercepted by  $A_{2}$  after direct travel, but only the fraction  $(1 - \rho_{2}^{s})$  is removed (by absorption and/or diffuse reflection) from the specular reflection path. The fraction  $\rho_{2}^{s}$  travels on specularly and is, therefore, counted a second time, etc. Thus, it is  $(1 - \rho_{2}^{s})F_{1 - 2}^{s}$  that must have a value between zero and one, and the summation relation, equation (4.18), must be replaced by

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}(1 - \rho_{j}^{s})F_{i - j}^{s} = 1. \tag{6.9}
$$

FIGURE 6-5 (a) Geometry for Example 6.2, (b) repeated reflections along outer surface.

Equation (6.9), formed here through intuition, will be developed rigorously in the next section.  $F_{1 - 1}^{s}$  may be found similarly as

$$
F_{1 - 1}^{s} = \rho_{2}^{s} + (\rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s})\rho_{2}^{s} + (\rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s})^{2}\rho_{2}^{s} + \ldots = \frac{\rho_{2}^{s}}{1 - \rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s}}.
$$

We note in passing that

$$
(1 - \rho_1^s)F_{1 - 1}^s +(1 - \rho_2^s)F_{1 - 2}^s = \frac{(1 - \rho_1^s)\rho_2^s + 1 - \rho_2^s}{1 - \rho_1^s\rho_2^s} = 1,
$$

as postulated by equation (6.9).

Example 6.2. Evaluate all specular view factors for two concentric cylinders or spheres.

# Solution

Possible beam paths with specular reflections from inner to outer cylinders (or spheres) and vice versa are shown in Fig. 6- 5a. As in the previous example a beam leaving  $A_{1}$  in any direction must hit surface  $A_{2}$  (with strength  $"1"$  ). Because of the circular geometry, after specular reflection the beam (now of strength  $\rho_{2}^{s}$  ) must return to  $A_{1}$  (i.e., it cannot hit  $A_{2}$  again before hitting  $A_{1}$  ). After renewed reflections the beam keeps bouncing back and forth between  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  . Thus, as for parallel plates,

$$
F_{1 - 2}^{s} = 1 + \rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s} + (\rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s})^{2} + \ldots = \frac{1}{1 - \rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s}}.
$$

Similarly, we have

$$
F_{1 - 1}^{s} = \rho_{2}^{s} + (\rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s})\rho_{2}^{s} + \ldots = \frac{\rho_{2}^{s}}{1 - \rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s}}.
$$

A beam emanating from  $A_{2}$  will first hit either  $A_{1}$  , and then keep bouncing back and forth between  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  (cf. Fig. 6- 5a), or  $A_{2},$  and then keep bouncing along  $A_{2}$  without ever hitting  $A_{1}$  (cf. Fig. 6- 5b). Thus, since the fraction  $F_{2 - 1}$  of the diffuse energy leaving  $A_{2}$  hits  $A_{1}$  after direct travel, we have

$$
\begin{array}{l}{F_{2 - 1}^{s} = F_{2 - 1}\left[1 + \rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s} + (\rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s})^{2} + \ldots \right] = \frac{A_{1} / A_{2}}{1 - \rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s}},}\\ {F_{2 - 2}^{s} = F_{2 - 2}\left[1 + \rho_{2}^{s} + (\rho_{2}^{s})^{2} + (\rho_{2}^{s})^{3} + \ldots \right] + F_{2 - 1}\left[\rho_{1}^{s} + \rho_{1}^{s}(\rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s}) + \ldots \right]}\\ {= \frac{1 - A_{1} / A_{2}}{1 - \rho_{2}^{s}} +\frac{\rho_{1}^{s}A_{1} / A_{2}}{1 - \rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s}},} \end{array}
$$

where the simple diffuse view factors  $F_{2 - 1}$  and  $F_{2 - 2}$  have been evaluated in terms of  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  .Of course,  $F_{2 - 1}^{s}$  could have been found from  $F_{1 - 2}^{s}$  by reciprocity, and  $F_{2 - 2}^{s}$  with the aid of equation (6.9).

A few more examples of specular view factor determinations will be given once the appropriate heat transfer relations have been developed.

# 6.3 ENCLOSURES WITH PARTIALLY SPECULAR SURFACES

Consider an enclosure of arbitrary geometry as shown in Fig. 6- 2. All surfaces are gray, diffuse emitters and gray reflectors with purely diffuse and purely specular components, i.e., their radiative properties obey equation (6.1). Under these conditions the net heat flux at a surface at location  $\mathbf{r}$  is, from Fig. 6- 6,

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & q(\mathbf{r}) = q_{\mathrm{emission}} - q_{\mathrm{absorption}} = \epsilon (\mathbf{r})[E_b(\mathbf{r}) - H(\mathbf{r})]\\ & \qquad = q_{\mathrm{out}} - q_{\mathrm{in}} = \epsilon (\mathbf{r})E_b(\mathbf{r}) + \rho^d (\mathbf{r})H(\mathbf{r}) + \rho^s (\mathbf{r})H(\mathbf{r}) - H(\mathbf{r}). \end{array} \tag{6.10}
$$

The first two terms on the last right- hand side of equation (6.10), or the part of the outgoing heat flux that leaves diffusely, we will again call the surface radiosity,

$$
J(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon (\mathbf{r})E_b(\mathbf{r}) + \rho^d (\mathbf{r})H(\mathbf{r}), \tag{6.11}
$$

so that

$$
q(\mathbf{r}) = J(\mathbf{r}) - [1 - \rho^s (\mathbf{r})]H(\mathbf{r}). \tag{6.12}
$$

Eliminating the irradiation  $H(\mathbf{r})$  from equations (6.10) and (6.12) leads to

$$
q(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{\epsilon(\mathbf{r})}{\rho^d(\mathbf{r})}\bigl [[1 - \rho^s (\mathbf{r})]E_b(\mathbf{r}) - J(\mathbf{r})\bigr ], \tag{6.13}
$$

which, of course, reduces to equation (5.26) for a diffusely reflecting surface if  $\rho^s = 0$  and  $\rho^d = 1 - \epsilon$ . For a purely specular reflecting surface  $(\rho^d = 0)$  equation (6.13) is indeterminate since the radiosity consists only of emission, or  $J = \epsilon E_b$ .

As in Chapter 5 the irradiation  $H(\mathbf{r})$  is found by determining the contribution to  $H$  from a differential area  $dA^{\prime}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})$ , followed by integration over the entire enclosure surface. A subtle difference is that we do not track the total energy leaving  $dA^{\prime}$  (multiplied by a suitable direct- travel view factor); rather, the contribution from specular reflections is subtracted and attributed to the surface from which it leaves diffusely. The more complicated path of such energy is then accounted for by the definition of the specular view factor. Thus, similar to equation (5.21),

$$
H(\mathbf{r})dA = \int_{A}J(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA^{\prime} - dA}^{s}dA^{\prime} + H_{o}^{s}(\mathbf{r})dA, \tag{6.14}
$$

where  $H_{o}^{s}(\mathbf{r})$  is any external irradiation arriving at  $dA$  (through openings or semitransparent walls). Similar to the specular view factors, the  $H_{o}^{s}$  includes external radiation hitting  $dA$  directly

or after any number of specular reflections. Using reciprocity, equation (6.14) becomes

$$
H(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{A}J(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA - dA^{\prime}}^{s} + H_{o}^{s}(\mathbf{r}), \tag{6.15}
$$

and, after substitution into equation (6.11), an integral equation for the unknown radiosity is obtained as

$$
J(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon (\mathbf{r})E_{b}(\mathbf{r}) + \rho^{d}(\mathbf{r})\left[\int_{A}J(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA - dA^{\prime}}^{s} + H_{o}^{s}(\mathbf{r})\right]. \tag{6.16}
$$

For surface locations for which heat flux  $q(\mathbf{r})$  is given rather than  $E_{b}(\mathbf{r})$ , equation (6.12) should be used rather than equation (6.11). It is usually more desirable to eliminate the radiosity, to obtain a single relationship between surface blackbody emissive powers and heat fluxes. Solving equation (6.13) for  $J$  gives

$$
J(\mathbf{r}) = \left[1 - \rho^s (\mathbf{r})\right]E_b(\mathbf{r}) - \frac{\rho^d(\mathbf{r})}{\epsilon(\mathbf{r})} q(\mathbf{r}), \tag{6.17}
$$

and substituting this expression into equation (6.16) leads to

$$
(1 - \rho^s)E_b - \frac{\rho^d}{\epsilon} q = (1 - \rho^s -\rho^d)E_b + \rho^d\left[\int_A(1 - \rho^s)E_bdF_{dA - dA'}^s -\int_A\frac{\rho^d}{\epsilon} qdF_{dA - dA'}^s +H_o^s\right],
$$

or

$$
E_{b}(\mathbf{r}) - \int_{A}\left[1 - \rho^{s}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})\right]E_{b}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA - dA^{\prime}}^{s} = \frac{q(\mathbf{r})}{\epsilon(\mathbf{r})} -\int_{A}\frac{\rho^{d}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})}{\epsilon(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})} q(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA - dA^{\prime}}^{s} + H_{o}^{s}(\mathbf{r}). \tag{6.18}
$$

We note that, for diffusely reflecting surfaces with  $\rho^{s} = 0$ ,  $\rho^{d} = 1 - \epsilon$ ,  $F_{i - j}^{s} = F_{i - j}$ , and  $H_{o}^{s} = H_{o}$ , equation (6.18) reduces to equation (5.28). If the specular view factors can be calculated (and that is often a big "if"), then equation (6.18) is not any more difficult to solve than equation (5.28). Indeed, if part or all of the surface is purely specular ( $\rho^{d} = 0$ ), equation (6.18) becomes considerably simpler.

As for black and gray- diffuse enclosures, it is customary to simplify the analysis by using an idealized enclosure, consisting of  $N$  relatively simple subsurfaces, over each of which the radiosity is assumed constant. Then

$$
\int_{A}J(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dF_{dA - dA^{\prime}}^{s}\simeq \sum_{j = 1}^{N}J_{j}\int_{A_{j}}dF_{dA - dA_{j}}^{s} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}J_{j}F_{dA - A_{j}}^{s},
$$

and, after averaging over a subsurface  $A_{i}$  on which  $dA$  is situated, equation (6.16) simplifies to

$$
J_{i} = \epsilon_{i}E_{bi} + \rho_{i}^{d}\left(\sum_{j = 1}^{N}J_{j}F_{i - j}^{s} + H_{oi}^{s}\right),\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{6.19}
$$

Eliminating radiosity through equation (6.17) then simplifies equation (6.18) to

$$
E_{bi} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}(1 - \rho_{i}^{s})F_{i - j}^{s}E_{bj} = \frac{q_{i}}{\epsilon_{i}} -\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\frac{\rho_{j}^{d}}{\epsilon_{j}} F_{i - j}^{s}q_{j} + H_{oi}^{s},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{6.20}
$$

The summation relation, equation (6.9), is easily obtained from equation (6.20) by considering a special case: In an isothermal enclosure ( $E_{b1} = E_{b2} = \dots = E_{bN}$ ) without external irradiation

$(H_{o1}^{s} = H_{o2}^{s} = \dots = 0)$ , according to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, all heat fluxes must vanish  $(q_{1} = q_{2} = \dots = 0)$ . Thus, canceling emissive powers,

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}(1 - \rho_j^s)F_{i - j}^s = 1,\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{6.21}
$$

Since the  $F_{i - j}^{s}$  are geometric factors and do not depend on temperature distribution, equation (6.21) is valid for arbitrary emissive power values.

Finally, for computer calculations it may be advantageous to write the emissive power and heat fluxes in matrix form. Introducing Kronecker's delta equation (6.20) becomes

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left[\delta_{ij} - (1 - \rho_j^s)F_{i - j}^s\right]E_{bj} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left(\frac{\delta_{ij}}{\epsilon_j} -\frac{\rho_j^d}{\epsilon_j} F_{i - j}^s\right)q_j + H_{oi}^s,\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{6.22}
$$

or2

$$
\mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathsf{b}} = \mathbf{C}\cdot \mathbf{q} + \mathbf{h}_{\mathsf{o}}^{s}, \tag{6.23}
$$

where  $\mathbf{C}$  and  $\mathbf{A}$  are matrices with elements

$$
\begin{array}{l}{A_{ij} = \delta_{ij} - (1 - \rho_j^s)F_{i - j}^s,}\\ {C_{ij} = \frac{\delta_{ij}}{\epsilon_j} -\frac{\rho_j^d}{\epsilon_j} F_{i - j}^s,} \end{array}
$$

and  $\mathbf{q},\mathbf{e}_{\mathsf{b}},$  and  $\mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{o}}^{\mathrm{s}}$  are vectors for the surface heat fluxes, emissive powers, and external irradiations, respectively. If all temperatures and external irradiations are known, the unknown heat fluxes are readily found by matrix inversion as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{C}^{-1}\cdot \left[\mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{b}} - \mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{o}}^{\mathrm{s}}\right]. \end{array} \tag{6.24}
$$

If the emissive power is only known over some of the surfaces, and the heat fluxes are specified elsewhere, equation (6.23) may be rearranged into a similar equation for the vector containing all the unknowns. Subroutine graydifspec is provided in Appendix F for the solution of the simultaneous equations (6.23), requiring surface information and a partial view factor matrix as input. The solution to a sample problem is also given in the form of a program grspecxch, which may be used as a starting point for the solution to other problems. Fortran90,  $\mathbb{C} + +$  as well as MATLAB® versions are provided.

Example 6.3. Two large parallel plates are separated by a nonparticipating medium as shown in Fig. 6- 4a. The bottom surface is isothermal at  $T_{1},$  with emittance  $\epsilon_{1}$  and a partially specular, partially diffuse reflectance  $\rho_{1} = \rho_{1}^{d} + \rho_{1}^{s}$  . Similarly, the top surface is isothermal at  $T_{2}$  with  $\epsilon_{2}$  and  $\rho_{2} = \rho_{2}^{d} + \rho_{2}^{s}$  . Determine the radiative heat flux between the surfaces.

# Solution

From equation (6.20) we have, for  $i = 1,$  with  $H_{o1}^{s} = 0,$

$$
E_{b1} - (1 - \rho_1^s)F_{1 - 1}^s E_{b1} - (1 - \rho_2^s)F_{1 - 2}^s E_{b2} = \frac{q_1}{\epsilon_1} -\frac{\rho_1^d}{\epsilon_1} F_{1 - 1}^s q_1 - \frac{\rho_2^d}{\epsilon_2} F_{1 - 2}^s q_2.
$$

While we could apply  $i = 2$  to equation (6.20) to obtain a second equation for  $q_{1}$  and  $q_{2},$  it is simpler here to use overall conservation of energy, or  $q_{2} = - q_{1}$  . Thus,

$$
q_{1} = \frac{\left[1 - (1 - \rho_{1}^{s})F_{1 - 1}^{s}\right]E_{b1} - (1 - \rho_{2}^{s})F_{1 - 2}^{s}E_{b2}}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} - \frac{1 - \epsilon_{1} - \rho_{1}^{s}}{\epsilon_{1}}F_{1 - 1}^{s} + \frac{1 - \epsilon_{2} - \rho_{2}^{s}}{\epsilon_{2}}F_{1 - 2}^{s}}.
$$

Using the results from Example 6.1 and dividing both numerator and denominator by  $F_{1 - 2}^{s}$ , we obtain

$$
q_{1} = \frac{(1 - \rho_{2}^{s})F_{1 - 2}^{s}(E_{b1} - E_{b2})}{\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} + \frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}}\right)(1 - \rho_{2}^{s})F_{1 - 2}^{s} + F_{1 - 1}^{s} - F_{1 - 2}^{s}} = \frac{(1 - \rho_{2}^{s})(1)(E_{b1} - E_{b2})}{\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} + \frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}}\right)(1 - \rho_{2}^{s})(1) + \rho_{2}^{s} - 1} = \frac{E_{b1} - E_{b2}}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} + \frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} - 1}, \tag{6.25}
$$

which produces the same result whether we have diffusely or specularly reflecting surfaces. Indeed, equation (6.25) is valid for the radiative transfer between two isothermal parallel plates, regardless of the directional behavior of the reflectance (i.e., it is not limited to the idealized reflectances considered in this chapter). Any beam leaving  $A_{1}$  must hit surface  $A_{2}$  and vice versa, regardless of whether the reflectance is diffuse, specular, or neither of the two, the surface locations will be different but the directional variation of reflectance has no influence on the heat transfer rate since the surfaces are isothermal.

Example 6.4. Repeat the previous example for concentric spheres and cylinders.

# Solution

Again, from equation (6.20) with  $i = 1$  and  $H_{oi}^{s} = 0$ , we obtain

$$
E_{b1} - (1 - \rho_1^s)F_{1 - 1}^s E_{b1} - (1 - \rho_2^s)F_{1 - 2}^s E_{b2} = \frac{q_1}{\epsilon_1} -\frac{\rho_1^d}{\epsilon_1} F_{1 - 1}^s q_1 - \frac{\rho_1^d}{\epsilon_1^2} F_{1 - 2}^s q_2.
$$

In this case conservation of energy demands  $q_{2}A_{2} = - q_{1}A_{1}$ , and

$$
q_{1} = \frac{\left[1 - (1 - \rho_{1}^{s})F_{1 - 1}^{s}\right]E_{b1} - (1 - \rho_{2}^{s})F_{1 - 2}^{s}E_{b2}}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} - \frac{1 - \epsilon_{1} - \rho_{1}^{s}}{\epsilon_{1}}F_{1 - 1}^{s} + \frac{1 - \epsilon_{2} - \rho_{2}^{s}}{\epsilon_{2}}\frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}}F_{1 - 2}^{s}} = \frac{(1 - \rho_{2}^{s})F_{1 - 2}^{s}(E_{b1} - E_{b2})}{\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} + \frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}}\frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}}\right)(1 - \rho_{2}^{s})F_{1 - 2}^{s} + F_{1 - 1}^{s} - \frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}}F_{1 - 2}^{s}}.
$$

The specular view factors  $F_{1 - 1}^{s}$  and  $F_{1 - 2}^{s}$  are the same as in the previous example (cf. Example 6.2), leading to

$$
q_{1} = \frac{E_{b1} - E_{b2}}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} + \frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}}\frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}} - \frac{A_{1} / A_{2} - \rho_{2}^{s}}{1 - \rho_{2}^{s}}}. \tag{6.26}
$$

We note that equation (6.26) does not depend on  $\rho_{1}^{s}$ : Again, any radiation reflected off surface  $A_{1}$  must return to surface  $A_{2}$ , regardless of the directional behavior of its reflectance. If surface  $A_{2}$  is purely specular  $(\rho_{2}^{s} = 1 - \epsilon_{2})$ , all radiation from  $A_{1}$  bounces back and forth between  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$ , and equation (6.26) reduces to equation (6.25), i.e., the heat flux between these concentric spheres or cylinders is the same as between parallel plates. On the other hand, if  $A_{2}$  is diffuse  $(\rho_{2}^{s} = 0)$  equation (6.26) reduces to the purely diffuse case since the directional behavior of  $\rho_{1}$  is irrelevant.

Example 6.5. A very long solar collector plate is to collect energy at a temperature of  $T_{1} = 350\mathrm{K}$ . To improve its performance for off- normal solar incidence, a highly reflective surface is placed next to the collector as shown in Fig. 6- 7. For simplicity you may make the following assumptions: The collector is isothermal and gray- diffuse with emittance  $\epsilon_{1} = 1 - \rho_{1}^{d} = 0.8$ ; the mirror is gray and specular with  $\epsilon_{2} = 1 - \rho_{2}^{s} = 0.1$ , and heat losses from the mirror by convection as well as all losses from the collector ends may be neglected. How much energy (per unit length) does the collector plate collect for solar irradiation of  $q_{\mathrm{sun}} = 1000\mathrm{Wm}^{2}$  at an incidence angle of  $30^{\circ}$ ?

# Solution

Applying equation (6.22) to the absorber plate  $(i = 1)$  as well as the mirror  $(i = 2)$  we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\left[1 - (1 - \rho_1^s)F_{1 - 1}^s\right]E_{b1} - (1 - \rho_2^s)F_{1 - 2}^s E_{b2} = \left[\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} -\frac{\rho_1^d}{\epsilon_1} F_{1 - 1}^s\right]q_1 - \frac{\rho_2^d}{\epsilon_2} F_{1 - 2}^s q_2 + H_{o1}^s,}\\ {-(1 - \rho_1^s)F_{2 - 1}^s E_{b1} + \left[1 - (1 - \rho_2^s)F_{2 - 2}^s\right]E_{b2} = -\frac{\rho_1^d}{\epsilon_1} F_{2 - 1}^s q_1 + \left[\frac{1}{\epsilon_2} -\frac{\rho_2^d}{\epsilon_2} F_{2 - 2}^s\right]q_2 + H_{o2}^s.} \end{array}
$$

FIGURE 6-7 Geometry for Example 6.5.

Since  $\rho_{1}^{s} = 0$ , it follows that  $F_{1 - 1}^{s} = F_{2 - 2}^{s} = 0$  and also  $F_{1 - 2}^{s} = F_{1 - 2}, F_{2 - 1}^{s} = F_{2 - 1}$ . For this configuration no specular reflections from one surface to another surface are possible (radiation leaving the absorber plate, after specular reflection from the mirror, always leaves the open enclosure). Thus, with  $q_{2} = 0$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{E_{b1} - \epsilon_2F_{1 - 2}E_{b2} = \frac{q_1}{\epsilon_1} +H_{o1}^s,}\\ {-F_{2 - 1}E_{b1} + E_{b2} = -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} -1\right)F_{2 - 1}q_1 + H_{o2}^s.} \end{array}
$$

Eliminating  $E_{b2}$ , by multiplying the second equation by  $\epsilon_{2}F_{1 - 2}$  and adding, leads to

$$
(1 - \epsilon_{2}F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1})E_{b1} = \left[\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} -1\right)q_{2}F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1}\right]q_{1} + H_{o1}^{s} + \epsilon_{2}F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1}H_{o2}^{s}.
$$

The external fluxes are evaluated as follows: The mirror receives solar flux only directly (no specular reflection off the absorber plate is possible), i.e.,  $H_{o2}^{s} = q_{\mathrm{sun}}\sin \phi$ . The absorber plate receives a direct contribution,  $q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \phi$ , and a second contribution after specular reflection off the mirror. This second contribution has the strength of  $\rho_{2}^{s}q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \phi$  per unit area. However, only part of the collector plate  $(l_{2}\tan \phi)$  receives this secondary contribution, which, for our crude two- node description, must be averaged over  $l_{1}$ . Thus,

$$
H_{o1}^{s} = q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \phi +\rho_{2}^{s}q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos \phi \frac{l_{2}\tan\phi}{l_{1}} = q_{\mathrm{sun}}\left[\cos \phi +(1 - \epsilon_{2})\frac{l_{2}}{l_{1}}\sin \phi \right].
$$

Therefore,

$$
q_{1} = \frac{(1 - \epsilon_{2}F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1})E_{b1} - [\cos\phi + (1 - \epsilon_{2})\sin\phi(l_{2} / l_{1}) + \epsilon_{2}F_{1 - 2}\sin\phi]q_{\mathrm{sun}}}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} - \epsilon_{2}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} - 1\right)F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1}}.
$$

The view factors are readily evaluated by the crossed- strings method as  $F_{1 - 2} = (80 + 60 - 100) / (2\times 80) = \frac{1}{4}$  and  $F_{2 - 1} = 80\times \frac{1}{4} /60 = \frac{1}{3}$ . Substituting numbers, we obtain

$$
q_{1} = \frac{\left(1 - 0.1\times\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{1}{3}\right)(5.670\times 10^{-8}\times 350^{4} - \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + 0.9\times\frac{1}{2}\times \frac{60}{80} + 0.1\times\frac{1}{4}\times \frac{1}{2}\right)1000}{\frac{1}{0.8} - 0.1\left(\frac{1}{0.8} - 1\right)\times\frac{1}{4}\times\frac{1}{3}} = -298\mathrm{W / m^{2}}.
$$

Under these conditions, therefore, the collector is about  $30\%$  efficient. This result should be compared with a collector without a mirror  $(l_{2} = 0$  and  $F_{1 - 2} = 0)$ , for which we get

$$
q_{1,\mathrm{no~mirror}} = \frac{E_{b1} - q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos\phi}{1 / \epsilon_1} = 0.8\times \left(5.670\times 10^{-8}\times 350^4 -1000\times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = -12\mathrm{W / m^2}.
$$

This absorber plate collects hardly any energy at all (indeed, after accounting for convection losses, it would experience a net energy loss). If the mirror had been a diffuse reflector the heat gain would have

FIGURE 6-8 Triangular enclosure with a single specularly reflecting surface, with a few possible beam paths indicated, (a) without obstructions, (b) with partial obstructions.

been  $q_{1,\mathrm{diffuse mirror}} = - 172\mathrm{W / m}^2$ , which is significantly less than for the specular mirror (cf. Problem 5.22).

We conclude from this example that (i) mirrors can significantly improve collector performance, and (ii) infrared reradiation losses from near- black collectors are very substantial. Of course, reradiation losses may be significantly reduced by using selective surfaces or glass- covered collectors (cf. Chapter 3).

We shall conclude this section with three more examples designed to clarify certain aspects of evaluating the specular view factors in enclosures comprised of only simple planar elements.

Example 6.6. Consider the triangular enclosures shown in Figs. 6- 8a and  $b$  . Surfaces  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  are isothermal at  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2},$  respectively, and are purely diffuse reflectors with  $\epsilon_{1} = 1 - \rho_{1}^{d}$  and  $\epsilon_{2} = 1 - \rho_{2}^{d}$  Surface  $A_{3}$  is isothermal at  $T_{3}$  and is a purely specular reflector with  $\epsilon_{3} = 1 - \rho_{3}^{s}$  . Set up the system of equations for the unknown surface heat fluxes.

# Solution

Since there is only a single (and flat) specular surface, no multiple specular reflections are possible. While  $F_{1 - 1}^{s}$  and  $F_{2 - 2}^{s}$  are nonzero, it is clear that  $F_{3 - 3}^{s} = 0$ . Thus, from equation (6.22), with  $H_{oi}^{s} = 0$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{(1 - F_{1 - 1}^{s})E_{b1} - F_{1 - 2}^{s}E_{b2} - \epsilon_{3}F_{1 - 3}^{s}E_{b3} = \left[\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} -1\right)F_{1 - 1}^{s}\right]q_{1} - \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} -1\right)F_{1 - 2}^{s}q_{2},}\\ {-F_{2 - 1}^{s}E_{b1} + (1 - F_{2 - 2}^{s})E_{b2} - \epsilon_{3}F_{2 - 3}^{s}E_{b3} = -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} -1\right)F_{2 - 1}^{s}q_{1} + \left[\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} -1\right)F_{2 - 2}^{s}\right]q_{2},}\\ {-F_{3 - 1}^{s}E_{b1} - F_{3 - 2}^{s}E_{b2} + E_{b3} = -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} -1\right)F_{3 - 1}^{s}q_{1} - \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} -1\right)F_{3 - 2}^{s}q_{2} + \frac{q_{3}}{\epsilon_{3}}.} \end{array}
$$

We note that  $q_{3}$  only enters the last equation, so we only have two simultaneous equations to solve (i.e., as many as we have surfaces with diffuse reflection components). We shall need to determine the specular view factors  $F_{1 - 1}^{s}, F_{1 - 2}^{s},$  and  $F_{2 - 2}^{s}$ , while the rest can be evaluated through reciprocity and the summation rule. Considering the first case of Fig. 6- 8a, we find

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & F_{1 - 1}^{s} = \rho_{3}^{s}F_{1(3) - 1},\\ & F_{1 - 2}^{s} = F_{1 - 2} + \rho_{3}^{s}F_{1(3) - 2},\quad \epsilon_{3}F_{1 - 3}^{s} = 1 - F_{1 - 1}^{s} - F_{1 - 2}^{s},\\ & F_{2 - 1}^{s} = A_{1}F_{1 - 2}^{s} / A_{2},\\ & F_{2 - 2}^{s} = \rho_{3}^{s}F_{2(3) - 2},\quad \epsilon_{3}F_{2 - 3}^{s} = 1 - F_{2 - 1}^{s} - F_{2 - 2}^{s},\\ & F_{3 - 1}^{s} = A_{1}F_{1 - 3}^{s} / A_{3},\quad F_{3 - 2}^{s} = A_{2}F_{2 - 3}^{s} / A_{3}, \end{array}
$$

where all view factors on the right- hand sides are readily evaluated through standard diffuse view factor analysis. The problem becomes slightly more difficult in the configuration shown in Fig. 6- 8b, where the specular surface is attached to another surface with an opening angle of  $>90^{\circ}$ . Standing in the left corner on surface  $A_{2}$ , one obviously cannot see all of the image  $A_{2(3)}$  from there by looking through

![](images/c493155688a3981026fb1f82d7e9bf211257b9d73e31a412b13863870feca675.jpg)

"mirror"  $A_{3}$ . Care must be taken that these visual obstructions are not overlooked. If the enclosure is two- dimensional, such partially obstructed view factors are no problem for the crossed- strings method, but may pose great difficulty for an analytical solution otherwise.

The effects of partial shading become somewhat more obvious when configurations with two or more adjacent specular surfaces are considered.

Example 6.7. Consider the rectangular enclosure shown in Fig. 6- 9. Surfaces  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  are purely specular, and surfaces  $A_{3}$  and  $A_{4}$  are purely diffuse reflectors. Top and bottom walls are at  $T_{1} = T_{3} = 1000\mathrm{K}$ , with  $\epsilon_{1} = 1 - \rho_{1}^{d} = \epsilon_{3} = 1 - \rho_{1}^{d} = 0.3$ ; the side walls are at  $T_{2} = T_{4} = 600\mathrm{K}$  with emittances  $\epsilon_{2} = 1 - \rho_{2}^{s} = \epsilon_{4} = 1 - \rho_{4}^{s} = 0.8$ . Determine the net radiative heat flux for each surface.

# Solution

Looking at Fig. 6- 9a, one sees that  $F_{1 - 1}^{s} = F_{2 - 2}^{s} = 0$ , while all other specular view factors are nonzero. Again, with  $H_{oi}^{s} = 0$ , we have from equation (6.22)

$$
\begin{array}{c}{E_{b1} - \epsilon_{2}F_{1 - 2}^{s}E_{b2} - F_{1 - 3}^{s}E_{b3} - F_{1 - 4}^{s}E_{b4} = \frac{q_{1}}{\epsilon_{1}} -\Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{3}} -1\Big)F_{1 - 3}^{s}q_{3} - \Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{4}} -1\Big)F_{1 - 4}^{s}q_{4},}\\ {-\epsilon_{1}F_{2 - 1}^{s}E_{b1} + E_{b2} - F_{2 - 3}^{s}E_{b3} - F_{2 - 4}^{s}E_{b4} = \frac{q_{2}}{\epsilon_{2}} -\Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{3}} -1\Big)F_{2 - 3}^{s}q_{3} - \Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{4}} -1\Big)F_{2 - 4}^{s}q_{4},}\\ {-\epsilon_{1}F_{3 - 1}^{s}E_{b1} - \epsilon_{2}F_{3 - 2}^{s}E_{b2} + (1 - F_{3 - 3}^{s})E_{b3} - F_{3 - 4}^{s}E_{b4} = \Big[\frac{1}{\epsilon_{3}} -\Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{3}} -1\Big)F_{3 - 3}^{s}\Big]q_{3} - \Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{4}} -1\Big)F_{3 - 4}^{s}q_{4},}\\ {-\epsilon_{1}F_{4 - 1}^{s}E_{b1} - \epsilon_{2}F_{4 - 2}^{s}E_{b2} - F_{4 - 3}^{s}E_{b3} + (1 - F_{4 - 4}^{s})E_{b4} = -\Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{3}} -1\Big)F_{4 - 3}^{s}q_{3} + \Big[\frac{1}{\epsilon_{4}} -\Big(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{4}} -1\Big)F_{4 - 4}^{s}\Big]q_{4}.} \end{array}
$$

Again, we have only two simultaneous equations to solve for the two (diffuse) heat fluxes  $q_{3}$  and  $q_{4}$ : The first two equations are explicit expressions for  $q_{1}$  and  $q_{2}$ , respectively (once  $q_{3}$  and  $q_{4}$  have been determined). Checking the various images in Fig. 6- 9a, we find that the specular view factors for surface  $A_{1}$  are

$$
\begin{array}{l}{F_{1 - 1}^{s} = 0,}\\ {F_{1 - 2}^{s} = F_{1 - 2},}\\ {F_{1 - 3}^{s} = F_{1 - 3} + \rho_{2}^{s}F_{1(2) - 3},}\\ {F_{1 - 4}^{s} = F_{1 - 4} + \rho_{2}^{s}F_{1(2) - 4}.} \end{array}
$$

Checking the summation rule, we find

$$
(1 - \rho_{1}^{s})F_{1 - 1}^{s} + (1 - \rho_{2}^{s})F_{1 - 2}^{s} + F_{1 - 3}^{s} + F_{1 - 4}^{s} = 0 + F_{1 - 2} + F_{1 - 3} + F_{1 - 4} - \rho_{2}^{s}(F_{1 - 2} - F_{1(2) - 3} - F_{1(2) - 4}) = 1
$$

or

$$
F_{1(2) - 3} + F_{1(2) - 4} = F_{1 - 2}.
$$

Indeed, by checking Fig.  $6 - 9a,$  we find

$$
F_{1(2) - 3} + F_{1(2) - 4} = F_{1(2) - (3 + 4)} = F_{1(2) - 2} = F_{1 - 2}.
$$

Similarly, we have

$$
\begin{array}{l}{F_{2 - 2}^{s} = 0,}\\ {F_{2 - 1}^{s} = F_{2 - 1},}\\ {F_{2 - 3}^{s} = F_{2 - 3} + \rho_{1}^{s}F_{2(1) - 3},}\\ {F_{2 - 4}^{s} = F_{2 - 4} + \rho_{1}^{s}F_{2(1) - 4}.} \end{array}
$$

For surfaces  $A_{3}$  and  $A_{4}$  dual specular reflections are possible:

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & F_{3 - 1}^{s} = F_{3 - 1} + \rho_{2}^{s}F_{3(2) - 1},\\ & F_{3 - 2}^{s} = F_{3 - 2} + \rho_{1}^{s}F_{3(1) - 2},\\ & F_{3 - 3}^{s} = \rho_{1}^{s}F_{3(1) - 3} + \rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s}F_{3(12) - 3} + \rho_{2}^{s}\rho_{1}^{s}F_{3(21) - 3},\\ & F_{3 - 4}^{s} = F_{3 - 4} + \rho_{1}^{s}F_{3(1) - 4} + \rho_{2}^{s}F_{3(2) - 4} + \rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s}F_{3(12) - 4} + \rho_{2}^{s}\rho_{1}^{s}F_{3(21) - 4},\\ & F_{4 - 1}^{s} = F_{4 - 1} + \rho_{2}^{s}F_{4(2) - 1},\\ & F_{4 - 2}^{s} = F_{4 - 2} + \rho_{1}^{s}F_{4(1) - 2},\\ & F_{4 - 3}^{s} = F_{4 - 3} + \rho_{1}^{s}F_{4(1) - 3} + \rho_{2}^{s}F_{4(2) - 3} + \rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s}F_{4(12) - 3} + \rho_{2}^{s}\rho_{1}^{s}F_{4(21) - 3},\\ & F_{4 - 4}^{s} = \rho_{2}^{s}F_{4(2) - 4} + \rho_{1}^{s}\rho_{2}^{s}F_{4(12) - 4} + \rho_{2}^{s}\rho_{1}^{s}F_{4(21) - 4}. \end{array}
$$

It is tempting to assume that  $F_{4(21) - 4} = F_{4(21) - 4},$  etc. Closer inspection of Figs. 6- 90 and  $\mathcal{C}$  reveals, however, that these view factors are partially obstructed: For example, for  $F_{4(21) - 4}$  all rays from  $A_{4(21)}$  to  $A_{4}$  must pass through the image  $A_{2(1)}$  as well as  $A_{1},$  i.e., all rays must stay below the corner between  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  (center point of Fig. 6- 9b). On the other hand, for  $F_{4(12) - 4}$  all rays from  $A_{4(12)}$  must stay above the corner between  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2},$  and both together add up to the unobstructed view factor from the image to  $A_{4}$  The same is true for  $F_{3(12) - 3} + F_{3(21) - 3}$  . However, the geometry is such that  $F_{4(21) - 3} = 0,$  while  $F_{4(12) - 3}$  is unobstructed (thus, still adding up to the unobstructed view factor). Similarly,  $F_{3(12) - 4} = 0,$  while  $F_{3(21) - 4}$  is unobstructed.

Simplifications for partially obstructed view factor were found for this particular simple geometry. Care must be taken before extrapolating these results to other configurations.

Before actually evaluating view factors one should take advantage of the fact that there are only two different surface temperatures, i.e.,  $E_{b3} = E_{b1}$  and  $E_{b4} = E_{b2},$  and only two emittances,  $\epsilon_{3} = \epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{4} = \epsilon_{2}$  ..

$$
(1 - F_{1 - 3}^{s})E_{b1} - (\epsilon_{2}F_{1 - 2}^{s} + F_{1 - 4}^{s})E_{b2} = \frac{q_{1}}{\epsilon_{1}} -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} -1\right)F_{1 - 3}^{s}q_{3} - \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} -1\right)F_{1 - 4}^{s}q_{4},
$$

$$
-(\epsilon_{1}F_{2 - 1}^{s} + F_{2 - 3}^{s})E_{b1} + (1 - F_{2 - 4}^{s})E_{b2} = \frac{q_{2}}{\epsilon_{2}} -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} -1\right)F_{2 - 3}^{s}q_{3} - \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} -1\right)F_{2 - 4}^{s}q_{4},
$$

$$
(1 - \epsilon_{1}F_{3 - 1}^{s} - F_{3 - 3}^{s})E_{b1} - (\epsilon_{2}F_{3 - 2}^{s} + F_{3 - 4}^{s})E_{b2} = \left[\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} -1\right)F_{3 - 3}^{s}\right]q_{3} - \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} -1\right)F_{3 - 4}^{s}q_{4},
$$

$$
-(\epsilon_{1}F_{4 - 1}^{s} + F_{4 - 3}^{s})E_{b1} + (1 - \epsilon_{2}F_{4 - 2}^{s} - F_{4 - 4}^{s})E_{b2} = -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} -1\right)F_{4 - 3}^{s}q_{3} + \left[\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} -1\right)F_{4 - 4}^{s}\right]q_{4}.
$$

The necessary view factors are readily found from the crossed- strings method [equation (4.50)], reciprocity, and the summation rule [equation (6.21)], as well as from Example 5.1 for the diffuse view factors:

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & F_{1 - 2}^{s} = F_{1 - 2} = 0.25;\\ & \qquad F_{1 - 3} = 0.5,\quad F_{1(2) - 3} = (\sqrt{64 + 9} +3 - 2\times 5) / 2\times 4 = 0.1930;\\ & F_{1 - 3}^{s} = 0.5 + 0.2\times 0.1930 = 0.5386;\\ & \qquad F_{1 - 4} = 0.25,\quad F_{1(2) - 4} = (5 + 8 - 4 - \sqrt{73}) / 8 = 0.0570;\\ & F_{1 - 4}^{s} = 0.25 + 0.2\times 0.0570 = 0.2614;\\ & F_{2 - 1}^{s} = F_{2 - 1} = 0.3333; \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & F_{2 - 3} = 0.3333,F_{2(1) - 3} = (5 + 6 - \sqrt{52} -3) / 6 = 0.1315;\\ & F_{2 - 3}^{s} = 0.3333 + 0.7\times 0.1315 = 0.4254;\\ & F_{2 - 4} = 0.3333,F_{2(1) - 4} = (\sqrt{52} +4 - 2\times 5) / 6 = 0.2019;\\ & F_{2 - 4}^{s} = 0.3333 + 0.7\times 0.2019 = 0.4746;\\ & F_{3 - 1}^{s} = F_{1 - 3}^{s} + 0.5386;\\ & F_{3 - 2}^{s} = A_{2}F_{2 - 3}^{s} / A_{3} = 0.75\times 0.4254 = 0.3191;\\ & F_{3(1) - 3} = (\sqrt{52} -6) / 4 = 0.3028,\\ & F_{3(2) - 3} = F_{3(2) - 3} = (10 + 6 - 2\sqrt{52}) / 8 = 0.1972;\\ & F_{3 - 3}^{s} = 0.7\times 0.3028 + 0.2\times 0.7\times 0.1972 = 0.2396;\\ & F_{3 - 4}^{s} = 1 - \epsilon_{1}F_{3 - 1}^{s} - \epsilon_{2}F_{3 - 2}^{s} - F_{3 - 3}^{s}\\ & = 1 - 0.3\times 0.5386 - 0.8\times 0.3191 - 0.2396 = 0.3436;\\ & F_{4 - 1}^{s} = A_{1}F_{1 - 4}^{s} / A_{4} = 0.2614 / 0.75 = 0.3485;\\ & F_{4 - 2}^{s} = F_{2 - 4}^{s} = 0.4746;\\ & F_{4 - 3}^{s} = A_{3}F_{3 - 4}^{s} / A_{4} = 0.3436 / 0.75 = 0.4581;\\ & F_{4 - 4}^{s} = 1 - \epsilon_{1}F_{4 - 1}^{s} - \epsilon_{2}F_{4 - 2}^{s} - F_{4 - 3}^{s}\\ & = 1 - 0.3\times 0.3485 - 0.8\times 0.4746 - 0.4581 = 0.0576. \end{array}
$$

Substituting these values into the heat flux equations and realizing, from the summation rule, that the two coefficients in front of  $E_{b1}$  and  $E_{b2}$  are the same for each equation, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{c}{(1 - 0.5386)(E_{b1} - E_{b2}) = \frac{q_1}{0.3} -\left(\frac{1}{0.3} -1\right)0.5386q_3 - \left(\frac{1}{0.8} -1\right)0.2614q_4,}\\ {-(1 - 0.4746)(E_{b1} - E_{b2}) = \frac{q_2}{0.8} -\left(\frac{1}{0.3} -1\right)0.4254q_3 - \left(\frac{1}{0.8} -1\right)0.4746q_4,}\\ {(0.8\times 0.3191 + 0.3436)(E_{b1} - E_{b2}) = \left[\frac{1}{0.3} -\left(\frac{1}{0.3} -1\right)0.2396\right]q_3 - \left(\frac{1}{0.8} -1\right)0.3436q_4,}\\ {-(0.3\times 0.3485 + 0.4581)(E_{b1} - E_{b2}) = -\left(\frac{1}{0.3} -1\right)0.4581q_3 + \left[\frac{1}{0.8} -\left(\frac{1}{0.8} -1\right)0.0576\right]q_4.} \end{array}
$$

After a little cleaning up these equations become

$$
\begin{array}{c}{2.7743q_3 - 0.0859q_4 = 0.5989(E_{b1} - E_{b2}),}\\ {-1.0689q_3 + 1.2356q_4 = -0.5627(E_{b1} - E_{b2}),}\\ {q_1 = 0.3770q_3 + 0.0196q_4 + 0.1384(E_{b1} - E_{b2}),}\\ {q_2 = 0.7941q_3 + 0.0949q_4 - 0.4203(E_{b1} - E_{b2}).} \end{array}
$$

Solving the first two equations leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q_3 = \frac{0.5989\times 1.2356 - 0.5627\times 0.0859}{2.7743\times 1.2356 - 1.0689\times 0.0859} (E_{b1} - E_{b2}) = 0.2073(E_{b1} - E_{b2}),}\\ {q_4 = \frac{0.5989\times 1.0689 - 0.5627\times 2.7743}{2.7743\times 1.2356 - 1.0689\times 0.0859} (E_{b1} - E_{b2}) = -0.2761(E_{b1} - E_{b2}),} \end{array}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & q_{1} = [0.3770\times 0.2073 + 0.0196\times (-0.2761) + 0.1384](E_{b1} - E_{b2}) = 0.2111(E_{b1} - E_{b2}),\\ & q_{2} = [0.7941\times 0.2073 + 0.0949\times (-0.2761) - 0.4203](E_{b1} - E_{b2}) = -0.2819(E_{b1} - E_{b2}). \end{array}
$$

To determine the net surface heat fluxes we evaluate

$$
E_{b1} - E_{b2} = \sigma (T_1^4 -T_2^4) = 5.670\times 10^{-8}(1000^4 -600^4)\mathrm{W / m^2} = 4.935\mathrm{W / cm^2}

\begin{array}{rl} & Q_1^s = 40\mathrm{cm}\times 0.2111\times 4.935\mathrm{W / cm}^2 = 41.7\mathrm{W / cm},\\ & Q_2^s = 30\mathrm{cm}\times (-0.2819)\times 4.935\mathrm{W / cm}^2 = -41.7\mathrm{W / cm},\\ & Q_3^s = 40\mathrm{cm}\times 0.2073\times 4.935\mathrm{W / cm}^2 = 40.9\mathrm{W / cm},\\ & Q_4^s = 30\mathrm{cm}\times (-0.2761)\times 4.935\mathrm{W / cm}^2 = -40.9\mathrm{W / cm}. \end{array}
$$

Checking our results, we note that the four heat fluxes add up to zero as they should.

The results of the present example—an enclosure with two adjacent specular reflectors—should be compared with those of Example 5.4, dealing with the identical problem except that all four surfaces were perfectly diffuse reflectors. For Example 5.4, we had found  $Q_{1}^{\prime} = - Q_{2}^{\prime} = Q_{3}^{\prime} = - Q_{4}^{\prime} = 42.3\mathrm{W / cm}$ . For the present configuration the heat fluxes of the specular surfaces are reduced by  $1\%$ , while the heat fluxes of the diffuse surfaces are reduced a little more, by approximately  $3\%$ . Overall, the effects of specularity are found to be rather minor.

In the last two examples only two simultaneous equations had to be solved, even though there were three and four unknown surface heat fluxes, respectively, because for any purely specular surface with known temperature the radiosity is not unknown, but is given as  $J = \epsilon E_{b}$ . Thus, for an enclosure consisting of  $N$  surfaces, of which  $n$  are purely specular with known temperature, only  $N - n$  simultaneous equations need to be solved. While this fact simplifies specular enclosure analysis as compared with diffuse enclosures, one should remember that, in general, specular view factors are considerably more difficult to evaluate.

As a final example for configurations with flat surfaces we shall consider a case where many specular reflections are possible.

Example 6.8. Since solar energy strikes the absorbing plate of a strategically oriented solar collector only over a narrow band of incidence directions (varying somewhat during the day, as well as during the year), the ideal collector material would be directionally selective: The emittance should be high for directions of solar incidence (to maximize energy collection), and low for all other directions (to minimize reradiation losses). One such material is a V- corrugated specular surface shown in Fig. 6- 10a. Assuming that the V- corrugated groove, with opening angle  $2\gamma$ , is coated with a purely specular

reflecting material, with emittance  $\epsilon = 1 - \rho^s$ , what is the apparent hemispherical emittance of such a surface (i.e., what is its heat loss compared with a flat black plate at the same temperature)?

# Solution

Calling the two surfaces in a single  $\mathrm{V}^{\prime \prime}A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$ , as indicated in Fig.  $6 - 10b$ , with  $E_{b1} = E_{b2} = E_{b}$ ,  $\epsilon_{1} = \epsilon_{2} = \epsilon$ , and  $H_{o1}^{s} = H_{o2}^{s} = 0$  we obtain from equation (6.22) (for  $i = 1$ )

$$
\left[1 - \epsilon \left(F_{1 - 1}^{s} + F_{1 - 2}^{s}\right)\right]E_{b} = \frac{q}{\epsilon}.
$$

Total heat lost from both surfaces of the groove is  $Q = q\times 2L = qd / \sin \gamma$ ; on the other hand, heat lost from a black surface covering the opening would be  $Q_{b} = E_{b}d$ . Thus, the apparent emittance is

$$
\epsilon_{a} = \frac{Q}{Q_{b}} = \frac{q}{E_{b}\sin\gamma} = \frac{\epsilon\left[1 - \epsilon\left(F_{1 - 1}^{s} + F_{1 - 2}^{s}\right)\right]}{\sin\gamma}.
$$

This expression could be further simplified, using summation rule and reciprocity, to  $\epsilon_{a} = \epsilon F_{1 - 3}^{s} / \sin \gamma = 2\epsilon F_{3 - 1}^{s}$ , where  $A_{3}$  is the open top of the  $\mathsf{V}$  (and of width  $d$ ). However,  $F_{1 - 1}^{s}$  and  $F_{1 - 2}^{s}$  are somewhat simpler to evaluate, and we shall do so here: A beam leaving surface  $A_{1}$  can return to  $A_{1}$  (i) after a single reflection off surface  $A_{2}$  [appearing to come from the image  $A_{1(2)}$ , as indicated in Fig.  $6 - 10b$ ], or (ii) after hitting  $A_{2}$ , traveling back to  $A_{1}$ , returning one more time to  $A_{2}$ , and hitting  $A_{1}$  a second time [i.e., a beam that appears to come from image  $A_{1(212)}$ ], and so on. Thus,

$$
F_{1 - 1}^{s} = \rho F_{(2) - 1} + \rho^{3}F_{1(212) - 1} + \rho^{5}F_{1(21212) - 1} + \ldots .
$$

$F_{1 - 2}^{s}$  may be similarly evaluated. We shall here determine  $F_{2 - 1}^{s} = F_{1 - 2}^{s}$  instead, since this expression allows us to employ the images shown in Fig.  $6 - 10b$ : Energy may travel directly from  $A_{2}$  to  $A_{1}$ , or go from  $A_{2}$  to  $A_{1}$ , get reflected back to  $A_{2}$ , and reflected back to  $A_{1}$  again [appearing to come from image  $A_{2(12)}$ ], and so forth. Therefore,

$$
F_{1 - 2}^{s} = F_{2 - 1}^{s} = F_{2 - 1} + \rho^{2}F_{2(12) - 1} + \rho^{4}F_{2(1212) - 1} + \ldots .
$$

Adding both together and using reciprocity (with all areas being the same), we obtain

$$
F_{1 - 1}^{s} + F_{1 - 2}^{s} = F_{1 - 2} + \rho F_{1 - 1(2)} + \rho^{2}F_{1 - 2(12)} + \rho^{3}F_{1 - 1(212)} + \ldots .
$$

Each one of these view factors  $F_{i - j}$  is subject to the restriction that all beams from  $A_{1}$  to the image  $A_{j}$  must pass through all the images between  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{j}$ ; however, in this geometry no partial obstruction occurs as seen from Fig.  $6 - 10b$ . The series above ends as soon as the image can no longer be seen from  $A_{1}$ , i.e., when the opening angle between  $A_{1}$  and the image exceeds  $180^{\circ}$ . The view factor for a  $\mathsf{V}$ - groove with opening angle  $2\phi$  is, from Configuration 34 in Appendix D,  $F_{2\phi} = 1 - \sin \phi$ . Thus,

$$
F_{1 - 1}^{s} + F_{1 - 2}^{s} = 1 - \sin \gamma +\rho (1 - \sin 2\gamma) + \rho^{2}(1 - \sin 3\gamma) + \ldots +\rho^{n - 1}(1 - \sin n\gamma),\quad n\gamma < \pi /2.
$$

Finally, the apparent hemispherical emittance of the  $\mathsf{V}$ - corrugated surface is

$$
\epsilon_{a} = \frac{\epsilon}{\sin\gamma}\left[1 - \epsilon \sum_{k = 0}^{n}\rho^{k - 1}(1 - \sin k\gamma)\right],\quad n< \pi /2\gamma .
$$

Figure 6- 11 shows the apparent hemispherical emittance of  $\mathsf{V}$ - corrugated surfaces as a function of opening angle for a number of flat- surface emittances. Also shown in the figure is the normal emittance (or absorptance), which may also be calculated from equation (6.22) (left as an exercise). For example, for  $\epsilon = 0.5$  and a groove opening angle of  $\gamma = 30^{\circ}$ , the apparent hemispherical emittance (important for reradiation losses) is 0.72, and the normal emittance (important for solar energy collection) is 0.88. While the difference between these two values is not huge, the corrugated groove (i) helps to make the absorber plate more black, and (ii) substantially reduces the reradiation losses (by  $\simeq 20\%$  for the  $\epsilon = 0.5$ ,  $\gamma = 30^{\circ}$  surface). More detail about the radiative properties of  $\mathsf{V}$ - corrugated grooves may be found in the papers by Eckert and Sparrow [4], Sparrow and Lin [5], and Hollands [6], and the book by Sparrow and Cess [7].

# Curved Surfaces with Specular Reflection Components

In all our examples we have only considered idealized enclosures consisting of flat surfaces, for which the mirror images necessary for specular view factor calculations are relatively easily determined. If some or all of the reflecting surfaces are curved then equations (6.18) and (6.20) remain valid, but the specular view factors tend to be much more difficult to obtain. Analytical solutions can be found only for relatively simple geometries, such as axisymmetric surfaces, but even then they tend to get very involved. The very simple case of cylindrical cavities (with and without specularly reflecting end plate) has been studied by Sparrow and coworkers [8- 10] and by Perlmutter and Siegel [11]. The more involved case of conical cavities has been treated by Sparrow and colleagues [9, 10,12] as well as Polgar and Howell [13], while spherical cavities have been addressed by Tsai and coworkers [14,15] and Sparrow and Jonsson [16,17]. Somewhat more generalized discussions on the determination of specular view factors for curved surfaces have been given by Plamondon and Horton [18] and by Burkhard and coworkers [19]. In view of the complexity involved in these evaluations, specular view factors for curved surfaces are probably most conveniently calculated by a statistical method, such as the Monte Carlo method, which will be discussed in detail in Chapter 8. A considerably more detailed discussion of thermal radiation from and within grooves and cavities is given in the book by Sparrow and Cess [7].

FIGURE 6-12 Electrical network equivalent for a four-surface enclosure ( $A_{1}$  = specular,  $A_{2}$  = diffuse,  $A_{3}$  = partially diffuse and specular,  $A_{4}$  = insulated, partially specular).

# 6.4 ELECTRICAL NETWORK ANALOGY

The electrical network analogy, first introduced in Section 5.4, may be readily extended to allow for partially specular reflectors. This possibility was first demonstrated by Ziering and Sarofim [20]. Expressing equations (6.12) and (6.15) for an idealized enclosure [i.e., an enclosure with finite surfaces of constant radiosity, exactly as was done in equation (6.19)], we can evaluate the nodal heat fluxes as

$$
q_{i} = J_{i} - (1 - \rho_{i}^{s})\left[\sum_{j = 1}^{N}J_{j}^{s}E_{i - j} + H_{oi}^{s}\right],\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{6.27}
$$

Using the summation rule, equation (6.21), this relation may also be written as the sum of net radiative interchange between any two surfaces,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q_i = \sum_{j = 1}^N\left[(1 - \rho_j^s)J_i - (1 - \rho_i^s)J_j\right]F_{i - j}^s -(1 - \rho_i^s)H_{oi}^s}\\ {= \sum_{j = 1}^N\left[\frac{J_i}{1 - \rho_i^s} -\frac{J_j}{1 - \rho_j^s}\right](1 - \rho_i^s)(1 - \rho_j^s)F_{i - j}^s -(1 - \rho_i^s)H_{oi}^s.} \end{array} \tag{6.28}
$$

Similarly, from equation (6.13),

$$
q_{i} = \frac{(1 - \rho_{i}^{s})\epsilon_{i}}{\rho_{i}^{d}}\left(E_{bi} - \frac{J_{i}}{1 - \rho_{i}^{s}}\right). \tag{6.29}
$$

After multiplication with  $A_{i}$  these relations may be combined and written in terms of potentials  $[E_{bi}$  and  $J_{i} / (1 - \rho_{i}^{s})]$  and resistances as

$$
Q_{i} = \frac{E_{bi} - \frac{J_{i}}{1 - \rho_{i}^{s}}}{\frac{\rho_{i}^{d}}{(1 - \rho_{i}^{s})\epsilon_{i}A_{i}}} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\frac{\frac{J_{i}}{1 - \rho_{i}^{s}} - \frac{J_{j}}{1 - \rho_{j}^{s}}}{\frac{1}{(1 - \rho_{i}^{s})(1 - \rho_{j}^{s})A_{i}E_{i - j}^{s}}} -(1 - \rho_{i}^{s})A_{i}H_{oi}^{s}. \tag{6.30}
$$

Of course, this relation reduces to equation (5.46) for the case of purely diffuse surfaces ( $\rho_{i}^{s} = 0$ ,  $i = 1,2,\ldots ,N$ ). As an example, Fig. 6- 12 shows the equivalent electrical network for an

enclosure consisting of four surfaces: Surface  $A_{1}$  is a specular reflector  $(\rho_{1}^{d} = 0)$ , surface  $A_{2}$  is a diffuse reflector  $(\rho_{2}^{s} = 0)$ , surface  $A_{3}$  has specular and diffuse reflectance components, and surface  $A_{4}$  (also partially specular) is insulated. Note that, unlike diffuse reflectance, the specular reflectance is not irrelevant for insulated surfaces.

# 6.5 RADIATION SHIELDS

As noted in Section 5.5 radiation shields tend to be made of specularly reflecting materials, such as polished metals or dielectric sheets coated with a metallic film. We would like, therefore, to extend the analysis to partly specular surfaces, i.e., (referring to Fig. 5- 13)  $\epsilon_{k} = 1 - \rho_{k}^{s} - \rho_{k}^{a}$  for all surfaces (inside and outside wall, all shield surfaces). Again, the analysis is most easily carried out using the electrical network analogy, and the resistance between any two layers has already been evaluated in Example 6.4, equation (6.26), as

$$
R_{j + k} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_jA_j} +\frac{1}{\epsilon_kA_k} -\frac{1}{1 - \rho_k^s}\left(\frac{1}{A_k} -\frac{\rho_k^s}{A_j}\right). \tag{6.31}
$$

The resistances given in equation (6.31) may be simplified somewhat if surface  $A_{k}$  is either a purely diffuse reflector  $(\rho_{k}^{s} = 0)$ , or a purely specular reflector  $(1 - \rho_{k}^{s} = \epsilon_{k})$ :

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{A_k\quad \mathrm{diffuse:}} & {R_{j - k} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_jA_j} +\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_k} -1\right)\frac{1}{A_k},}\\ {A_k\quad \mathrm{specular:}} & {R_{j - k} = \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_j} +\frac{1}{\epsilon_k} -1\right)\frac{1}{A_j}.} \end{array} \tag{6.32b}
$$

Following the procedure of Section 5.5, equation (5.48) still holds, i.e.,

$$
Q = \frac{E_{bi} - E_{bo}}{R_{i - 1i} + \sum_{n = 1}^{N - 1}R_{no - n + 1,i} + R_{No - o}}. \tag{6.33}
$$

Example 6.9. Repeat Example 5.9 for purely specularly reflecting shields. The wall material (steel) may be diffusely or specularly reflecting.

# Solution

As before we note from equation (6.32) that the resistances are inversely proportional to shield area, and will again assume  $A_{1} \simeq A_{2} \simeq \ldots \simeq A_{N} = A_{s} = \pi D_{s}L$ , with  $D_{s} = 11\mathrm{cm}$ . Evaluating the total resistance from equations (6.33) and (6.32), we find

$$
A_{i}R_{\mathrm{tot}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_{w}} +\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{s}} -1\right)\frac{A_{i}^{*}}{A_{s}} +\sum_{n = 1}^{N - 1}\left(\frac{2}{\epsilon_{s}} -1\right)\frac{A_{i}}{A_{s}} +\frac{1}{\epsilon_{s}}\frac{A_{i}}{A_{s}} +\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{o}} -1\right)\frac{A_{i}}{A_{o}^{*}},
$$

where, if the steel is specular  $A_{i}^{*} = A_{i}, A_{o}^{*} = A_{s}$ , and if it is diffuse  $A_{i}^{*} = A_{s}, A_{o}^{*} = A_{o}$ . We shall investigate both possibilities to see whether specularity of the steel is an important factor in this arrangement. Again, we may solve for  $N$  as

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & N = \frac{A_{i}R_{\mathrm{tot}} - \frac{1}{\epsilon_{w}} - \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{w}} - 1\right)\frac{A_{i}}{A_{o}^{*}} + \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{s}} - 1\right)\left(\frac{A_{i}^{*}}{A_{s}} - \frac{A_{i}}{A_{s}}\right)}{\left(\frac{2}{\epsilon_{s}} - 1\right)\frac{A_{i}}{A_{s}}}\\ & = \frac{580.0 - \frac{1}{0.3} - \left(\frac{1}{0.3} - 1\right)\frac{10}{11} - \left(\frac{1}{0.05} - 1\right)\left(1 - \frac{10}{11}\right)}{\left(\frac{2}{0.05} - 1\right)\frac{10}{11}} = 16.16,\\ & = \frac{580.0 - \frac{1}{0.3} - \left(\frac{1}{0.3} - 1\right)\frac{10}{20} - \left(\frac{1}{0.05} - 1\right)\left(\frac{10}{11} - \frac{10}{11}\right)}{\left(\frac{2}{0.05} - 1\right)\frac{10}{11}} = 16.23, \end{array}
$$

steel specular,

steel diffuse.

Therefore, the same minimum of 17 radiation shields would be required. We note that the specularity of the shields has no impact whatsoever (because we assumed them to be infinitely close together in this analysis), while specular inner and outer cylinder walls marginally improve performance. Without radiation shields we obtain

$$
q_{i} = \frac{|E_{bi} - E_{bo}|}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_{w}} + \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{w}} - 1\right)\times\left[1\mathrm{or}\frac{A_{i}}{A_{o}}\right]} = \frac{5.670\times 10^{-12}|4.2^{4} - 298^{4}|}{\frac{1}{0.3} + \left(\frac{1}{0.3} - 1\right)\times[1\mathrm{or}\frac{1}{2}]}
$$

$$
= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}9.94\times 10^{-3}\mathrm{W / cm}^2, & \mathrm{steel~diffuse},\\ 7.89\times 10^{-3}\mathrm{W / cm}^2, & \mathrm{steel~specular}, \end{array} \right.
$$

i.e, without shields the aspect ratio  $A_{i} / A_{o} = 1 / 2$  deviates considerably from unity, making the differences between specular and diffuse cylinders more apparent.

# 6.6 SEMITRANSPARENT SHEETS (WINDOWS)

When we developed the governing relations for radiative heat transfer in an enclosure bounded by diffusely reflecting surfaces (Chapter 5) or by partially diffuse/partially specular reflectors (this chapter), we made allowance for external radiation to penetrate into the enclosure through holes and/or semitransparent surfaces (windows). While we have investigated some examples with external radiation entering through holes, only one (Example 5.8) has dealt with a simple semitransparent surface.

Radiative heat transfer in enclosures with semitransparent windows occurs in a number of important applications, such as solar collectors, externally irradiated specimens kept in a controlled atmosphere, furnaces with sight windows, and so on. We shall briefly outline in this section how such enclosures may be analyzed with equation (6.18) or (6.22). To this purpose we shall assume that properties of the semitransparent window are wavelength- independent (gray), that equation (6.1) describes the reflectance (facing the inside of the enclosure), and that the transmittance of the window also has specular (light is transmitted without change of direction) and diffuse (light leaving the window is perfectly diffuse) components. Thus,

$$
\rho +\tau +\alpha = \rho^{s} + \rho^{d} + \tau^{s} + \tau^{d} + \alpha = 1,\quad \epsilon = \alpha . \tag{6.34}
$$

Further, we shall assume that radiation hitting the outside of the window has a collimated component  $q_{oc}$  (i.e., parallel rays coming from a single direction; such as sunshine) and a diffuse component  $q_{od}$  (such as sky radiation coming in from all directions with equal intensity). Making an energy balance for the net radiative heat flux from the semitransparent window into the enclosure leads to (cf. Fig. 6- 13):

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & q(\mathbf{r}) = q_{\mathrm{em}} + q_{\mathrm{tr,in}} - q_{\mathrm{abs}} - q_{\mathrm{tr,out}}\\ & \qquad = \epsilon (\mathbf{r})E_b(\mathbf{r}) + \tau^d (\mathbf{r})q_{\mathrm{oc}}(\mathbf{r}) + \tau (\mathbf{r})q_{\mathrm{od}}(\mathbf{r}) - \alpha (\mathbf{r})H(\mathbf{r}) - \tau (\mathrm{i})H(\mathbf{r}), \end{array} \tag{6.35}
$$

where the specularly transmitted fraction of the collimated external radiation,  $\tau^{s}q_{oc}$ , has not been accounted for since it enters the enclosure in a nondiffuse fashion; it is accounted for in  $H_{o}^{s}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})$  as part of the irradiation at another enclosure location  $\mathbf{r}^{\prime}$  (traveling there directly, or after any number of specular reflections). Using equation (6.34), equation (6.35) may also be written as

$$
q(\mathbf{r}) = q_{\mathrm{out}} - q_{\mathrm{in}} = \left(\epsilon E_b + \tau^d q_{oc} + \tau q_{od} + \rho^d H + \rho^s H\right) - H, \tag{6.36}
$$

![](images/395131a38e863b5058085c166d713f4d3711275331d4e5fd9af04f8d1308e540.jpg)  
FIGURE 6-13 Energy balance for a semitransparent window.

where  $q_{\mathrm{in}}$  is the energy falling onto the inside of the window coming from within the enclosure. The first four terms of  $q_{\mathrm{out}}$  are diffuse and may be combined to form the radiosity

$$
J(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon E_b + \tau^d q_{oc} + \tau q_{od} + \rho^d H. \tag{6.37}
$$

Examination of equations (6.34) through (6.37) shows that they may be reduced to equations (6.10) through (6.12) if we introduce an apparent emittance  $\epsilon_{a}$  and an apparent blackbody emissive power  $E_{b,a}$  as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\epsilon_{a}(\tau) = \epsilon +\tau = 1 - \rho ,}\\ {\epsilon_{a}E_{b,a}(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon E_{b} + \tau^{d}q_{oc} + \tau q_{od}.} \end{array} \tag{6.38a}
$$

Thus, the semitransparent window is equivalent to an opaque surface with apparent emittance  $\epsilon_{a}$  and apparent emissive power  $E_{b,a}$  (if the radiative properties are gray). Therefore, equations (6.18) and (6.22) remain valid as long as the emittance and blackbody emissive powers of semitransparent surfaces are understood to be apparent values.

Example 6.10. A long hallway  $3\mathrm{m}$  wide by  $4\mathrm{m}$  high is lighted with a skylight that covers the entire ceiling. The skylight is double- glazed with an optical thickness of  $\kappa d = 0.037$  per window plate. The floor and sides of the hallway may be assumed to be gray and diffuse with  $\epsilon = 0.2$ . The outside of the skylight is exposed to a clear sky, so that diffuse visible light in the amount of  $q_{\mathrm{sky}} = 20,000\mathrm{lm} / \mathrm{m}^2$  is incident on the skylight. Direct sunshine also falls on the skylight in the amount of  $q_{\mathrm{sun}} = 80,000\mathrm{lm} / \mathrm{m}^2$  (normal to the rays). For simplicity assume that the sun angle is  $\theta_{s} = 36.87$  as indicated in Fig. 6- 14. Determine the amount of light incident on a point in the lower right- hand corner (also indicated in the figure) if  $(a)$  the skylight is clear,  $(b)$  the skylight is diffusing (with the same transmittance and reflectance).

# Solution

From Fig. 3- 32 for double glazing and  $\kappa d = 0.037$  we find a hemispherical transmittance (i.e., directionally averaged) of  $\tau \simeq 0.70$ , while for solar incidence with  $\theta = 36.87^{\circ}$  we have  $\tau_{\theta} \simeq 0.75$ . The hemispherical reflectance of the skylight may be estimated by assuming that the reflectance is the same as the one of a nonabsorbing glass. Then, from Fig. 3- 31  $\rho_{1} = \rho_{1}^{s} = 1 - \tau (\kappa d = 0) \simeq 1 - 0.75 = 0.25$ . From equation (6.38) we find  $\epsilon_{1,a} = 1 - \rho_{1} = 0.75$  and, for a clear skylight,  $\epsilon_{1,a}E_{b1,a} = 0 + 0 + \tau q_{\mathrm{sky}}$  since  $\tau^{d} = 0$ , and since there is no luminous emission from the window (or from any of the other walls, for that matter). Because of the special sun angle, direct sunshine falls only onto surface  $A_{2}$ , filling the entire wall, i.e.,  $H_{o2}^{s} = \tau_{\theta}q_{\mathrm{sun}}\sin \theta_{s}$ .

To determine the illumination at the point in the corner, we need to calculate the local irradiation  $H$  (in terms of lumens). This calculation, in turn, requires knowledge of the radiosity for all the surfaces of the hallway (for the skylight it is already known as  $J_{1} = \epsilon_{1,a}E_{b1,a} = \tau q_{\mathrm{sky}}$ , since  $\rho_{1}^{d} = 0$ ). To this purpose we shall approximate the hallway as a four- surface enclosure for which we shall calculate the

![](images/ed16d0f7b78c2744174bb58a4549b776c1fc9dfc8cb5980878e446699e090f0f.jpg)  
FIGURE 6-14 Geometry for a skylit hallway (Example 6.10).

average radiosities. Based on these radiosities we may then calculate the local irradiation for a point from equation (6.15). While equation (6.22) is most suitable for heat transfer calculations, we shall use equation (6.19) for this example since radiosities are more useful in lighting calculations.4 Therefore, for  $i = 2,3,$  and 4,

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & J_{2} = \rho_{2}\left(J_{1}F_{2 - 1}^{s} + J_{2}F_{2 - 2}^{s} + J_{3}F_{2 - 3}^{s} + J_{4}F_{2 - 4}^{s}\right) + H_{o2}^{s},\\ & J_{3} = \rho_{3}\left(J_{1}F_{3 - 1}^{s} + J_{2}F_{3 - 2}^{s} + J_{3}F_{3 - 3}^{s} + J_{4}F_{3 - 4}^{s}\right),\\ & J_{4} = \rho_{4}\left(J_{1}F_{4 - 1}^{s} + J_{2}F_{4 - 2}^{s} + J_{3}F_{4 - 3}^{s} + J_{4}F_{4 - 4}^{s}\right). \end{array}
$$

The necessary view factors are readily calculated from the crossed- strings method:

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & F_{2 - 1}^{s} = F_{2 - 1} = \frac{3 + 4 - 5}{2\times 4} = 0.25,F_{2 - 2}^{s} = 0,\\ & F_{2 - 3}^{s} = F_{2 - 3} + \rho_{1}F_{2(1) - 3} = 0.25 + 0.25\times \frac{8 + 5 - (4 + \sqrt{73})}{2\times 4} = 0.25(1 + 0.05700) = 0.26425,\\ & F_{2 - 4}^{s} = F_{2 - 4} + \rho_{1}F_{2(1) - 4} = 0.5 + 0.25\times \frac{3 + \sqrt{73} - 2\times 5}{2\times 4} = 0.5 + 0.25\times 0.19300 = 0.54825,\\ & F_{3 - 1}^{s} = F_{3 - 1} = \frac{2\times 5 - 2\times 4}{2\times 3} = 0.33333,\\ & F_{3 - 2}^{s} = \frac{A_{2}}{A_{3}} F_{2 - 3}^{s} = \frac{4}{3}\times 0.26425 = 0.35233,\\ & F_{3 - 3}^{s} = \rho_{1}F_{3(1) - 3} = 0.25\times \frac{2\times\sqrt{73} - 2\times 8}{2\times 3} = 0.25\times 0.18133 = 0.04533,\\ & F_{3 - 4}^{s} = F_{3 - 2}^{s} = 0.35233,\\ & F_{4 - 1}^{s} = F_{2 - 1}^{s} = 0.2500,F_{4 - 2}^{s} = F_{2 - 4}^{s} = 0.54825,\\ & F_{4 - 3}^{s} = F_{2 - 3}^{s} = 0.26425,F_{4 - 4}^{s} = 0. \end{array}
$$

Therefore, after normalization with  $\mathcal{J}_i = J_i / J_1$  and  $\mathcal{H} = H_{o2}^{s} / J_{1},$  and with  $\rho_{3} = \rho_{3} = \rho_{4} = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8,$

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathcal{J}_2 = 0.8(0.25 + 0 + 0.26425\mathcal{J}_3 + 0.54825\mathcal{J}_4) + \mathcal{H},}\\ & {\mathcal{J}_3 = 0.8(0.33333 + 0.35233\mathcal{J}_2 + 0.04533\mathcal{J}_3 + 0.35233\mathcal{J}_4),}\\ & {\mathcal{J}_4 = 0.8(0.25 + 0.54825\mathcal{J}_2 + 0.26425\mathcal{J}_3 + 0),} \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathcal{J}_2 - 0.21140\mathcal{J}_3 - 0.43860\mathcal{J}_4 = \mathcal{H} + 0.2,\\ -0.28186\mathcal{J}_2 + 0.96374\mathcal{J}_3 - 0.28186\mathcal{J}_4 = 0.26667,\\ -0.43860\mathcal{J}_2 - 0.21140\mathcal{J}_3 + \mathcal{J}_4 = 0.2. \end{array}
$$

Omitting the details of solving these three simultaneous equations, we find

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathcal{J}_2 = 1.48978\mathcal{H} + 0.59051,\\ \mathcal{J}_3 = 0.66812\mathcal{H} + 0.62211,\\ \mathcal{J}_4 = 0.79466\mathcal{H} + 0.59051. \end{array}
$$

The irradiation onto the corner point is, from equation (6.15)

$$
H_{p} = \sum_{j = 1}^{4}J_{j}F_{p - j}^{s} = J_{1}\left(F_{p - 1}^{s} + \mathcal{J}_{2}F_{p - 2}^{s} + \mathcal{J}_{3}F_{p - 3}^{s} + \mathcal{J}_{4}F_{p - 4}^{s}\right),
$$

where the view factors may be determined from Configurations 10 and 11 in Appendix D (with  $b\to \infty$  and multiplying by 2 since the strip tends to infinity in both directions):

$$
\begin{array}{l}{F_{p - 1}^{s} = F_{p - 1} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^{2} + c^{2}}} = \frac{1}{2}\times \frac{3}{5} = 0.3,}\\ {F_{p - 2}^{s} = F_{p - 2} + \rho_{1}F_{p(1) - 2} = F_{p - 2} + \rho_{1}\left[F_{p(1) - 2 + 2(1)} - F_{p(1) - 2(1)}\right],}\\ {F_{p - 2} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{c}{\sqrt{a^{2} + c^{2}}}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{3}{5}\right) = 0.2,}\\ {F_{p(1) - 2(1)} = F_{p - 2} = 0.2,F_{p(1) - 2 + 2(1)} = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{73}}\right) = 0.32444,}\\ {F_{p - 2}^{s} = 0.2 + 0.25\times (0.32444 - 0.2) = 0.23111,}\\ {F_{p - 3}^{s} = \rho_{1}F_{p(1) - 3} = 0.25\times \frac{1}{2}\times \frac{3}{\sqrt{73}} = 0.04389,F_{p - 4}^{s} = 0.5.} \end{array}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\mathcal{H}_p = \frac{H_p}{J_1} = 0.3 + 0.23111\times (1.48978\mathcal{H} + 0.59051)}\\ {+0.04389\times (0.66812\mathcal{H} + 0.62211) + 0.5\times (0.79466\mathcal{H} + 0.59051)}\\ {= 0.77096\mathcal{H} + 0.75903.} \end{array}
$$

Finally, for a clear window,  $J_{1} = \tau_{1}q_{\mathrm{sky}} = 0.7\times 20,000 = 14,000\mathrm{lx},$  and  $H_{o2}^{s} = \tau_{\theta}q_{\mathrm{sun}}\sin 36.87^{\circ} = 0.75\times$ $80,000\times 0.6 = 36,000\mathrm{lx},$  and

$$
H_{p} = 0.77096\times 36,000 + 0.75903\times 14,000 = 38,381\mathrm{lx}.
$$

On the other hand, if the window has a diffusing transmittance  $\tau = \tau^{d} = 0.7,$  then  $H_{o2}^{s} = 0$  and, from equation (6.37),  $J_{1} = \tau (q_{\mathrm{sky}} + q_{\mathrm{sun}}\cos 36.87^{\circ}) = 0.7\times (20,000 + 80,000\times 0.8) = 58,800\mathrm{lx}.$  This results in

$$
H_{p} = 0.75903\times 58,800 = 44,631\mathrm{lx}.
$$

For a diffusing window the light is more evenly distributed throughout the hallway, resulting in higher illumination at point  $p$

# 6.7 SOLUTION OF THE GOVERNING INTEGRAL EQUATION

As in the case for diffusely reflecting surfaces the methods of the previous sections require the radiosity to be constant over each subsurface, a condition rarely met in practice. More accurate results may be obtained by solving the governing integral equation, either equation (6.16) (to determine radiosity  $J$ ) or equation (6.18) (to determine the unknown heat flux and/or surface temperature directly), by any of the methods outlined in Chapter 5. This is best illustrated by repeating Examples 5.10 to 5.12.

Example 6.11. Consider two long parallel plates of width  $w$  as shown in Fig. 6- 15. Both plates are isothermal at the (same) temperature  $T$ , and both have a gray, diffuse emittance of  $\epsilon$ . The reflectance of the material is partly diffuse, partly specular, so that  $\epsilon = 1 - \rho^{s} - \rho^{d}$ . The plates are separated by a distance  $h$  and are placed in a large, cold environment. Determine the local radiative heat fluxes along the plate using numerical quadrature.

# Solution

From equation (6.18) we find, for location  $x_{1}$  on the lower plate,

$$
E_{b} - (1 - \rho^{s})E_{b}\left[\int_{0}^{w}dF_{dx_{1} - dx_{1}^{\prime}}^{s} + \int_{0}^{w}dF_{dx_{1} - dx_{2}^{\prime}}^{s}\right] = \frac{q(x_{1})}{\epsilon} -\frac{\rho^{d}}{\epsilon}\left[\int_{0}^{w}q(x_{1}^{\prime})dF_{dx_{1} - dx_{1}^{\prime}}^{s} + \int_{0}^{w}q(x_{2}^{\prime})dF_{dx_{1} - dx_{2}^{\prime}}^{s}\right].
$$

The necessary specular view factors are readily found from

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {dF_{dx_1 - dx_1'}^s = \rho^s dF_{dx_1(2) - dx_1'} + (\rho^s)^3 dF_{dx_1(212) - dx_1'} + \dots}\\ & {dF_{dx_1 - dx_2'}^s = dF_{dx_1 - dx_2'} + (\rho^s)^2 dF_{dx_1(21) - dx_2'} + \dots} \end{array}
$$

The view factor between two infinitely long parallel strips of infinitesimal width and separated by a distance  $k\pi (k = 1,2,\ldots)$  is given by Example 3.10 as

$$
\frac{1}{2}\frac{(kh)^2dx'}{[(kh)^2 + (x - x')^2]^{3 / 2}}.
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {dF_{dx_1 - dx_1'}^s +dF_{dx_1 - dx_2'}^s = dF_{dx_1 - dx_2'} + \rho^s dF_{dx_1(2) - dx_1'} + (\rho^s)^2 dF_{dx_1(1) - dx_2'} + \dots}\\ & {\qquad = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}(\rho^s)^{k - 1}\frac{(kh)^2dx'}{[(kh)^2 + (x_1 - x')^2]^{3 / 2}},} \end{array}
$$

FIGURE 6-16 Local radiative heat flux on isothermal, parallel plates with diffuse and specular reflection components.

where we have made use of  $x_{1}^{\prime} = x_{2}^{\prime} = x^{\prime}$ . This expression may be substituted into the governing integral equation. Realizing that, by symmetry,  $q(x_{1}^{\prime}) = q(x_{2}^{\prime}) = q(x^{\prime})$  and nondimensionalizing with  $\xi = x / h$ ,  $W = w / h$ , and  $\Psi = q(\xi) / E_{b}$ , lead to

$$
1 - (1 - \rho^s)\int_0^W\frac{1}{2}\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{(\rho^s)^{k - 1}k^2d\xi'}{[k^2 + (\xi - \xi')^2]^{3 / 2}} = \frac{\Psi(\xi)}{\epsilon} -\frac{\rho^d}{\epsilon}\left[\int_0^W\Psi (\xi ')^{\frac{1}{2}}\sum_{k = 1}^\infty \frac{(\rho^s)^{k - 1}k^2d\xi'}{[k^2 + (\xi - \xi')]^{3 / 2}}\right].
$$

As in Example 5.11 this equation may be solved by numerical quadrature as

$$
\Psi_{i} - \rho^{d}W\sum_{j = 1}^{J}c_{j}\Psi_{j}f_{ij} = \epsilon \left[1 - (1 - \rho^{s})W\sum_{j = 1}^{J}c_{j}f_{ij}\right],
$$

where  $\Psi_{i}$  is evaluated at  $J$  nodal positions  $\xi_{i}, i = 1,2,\ldots ,J$ , and the  $c_{j}$  are weight coefficients for the numerical integration. The  $f_{ij}$  are an abbreviation for the integration kernel,

$$
f_{ij} = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k = 1}^{\infty}\frac{k^2(\rho^s)^{k - 1}}{[k^2 + (\xi_i - \xi_j)^2]^{3 / 2}}.
$$

They must be evaluated by summing as many terms as necessary (decreasing as  $(\rho^{s})^{k - 1} / k$  for large  $k$ ). Results for the same simple  $J = 5$  quadrature of Example 5.11 are given in Fig. 6- 16, together with "exact" solutions (high- order quadrature). The results show that, for  $W = w / h = 1$ , the heat loss from the plates decreases if reflection is specular: Specular reflection traps emitted radiation somewhat more through repeated reflections between the plates.

Note that, if both surfaces are purely specular, the heat flux may be calculated directly (i.e., no solution of an integral equation is necessary). This calculation was first done for the parallel- plate case by Eckert and Sparrow [4]. In general, equation (6.18) is actually easier to solve than its diffuse- reflection counterpart if some or all of the surfaces are purely specular. However, the necessary specular view factors are generally much more difficult—if not impossible—to evaluate. Such a case arises, for example, for curved surfaces with multiple specular reflections. Since the specular view factors for such problems are most easily found from statistical methods, such as the Monte Carlo method (Chapter 8), it is usually best to solve the entire heat transfer problem using the Monte Carlo method.

# 6.8 CONCLUDING REMARKS

Before leaving the topic of specularly reflecting surfaces we want to discuss briefly under what circumstances the assumption of a partly diffuse, partly specular reflector is appropriate. The analysis for such surfaces is generally considerably more involved than for diffusely reflecting surfaces, as a result of the more difficult evaluation of specular view factors. On the other hand, the analysis is substantially less involved than for surfaces with more irregular reflection behavior (as will be discussed in the following chapter).

Examples 6.3 and 6.7 have shown that in fully closed configurations (without external irradiation) the heat fluxes show very little dependence on specularity. This is true for all closed configurations as long as there are no long and narrow channels separating surfaces of widely different temperatures (cf. Problems 6.3 and 6.4). Therefore, for most practical enclosures it should be sufficient to evaluate heat fluxes assuming purely diffuse reflectors—even though a number of surfaces may be decidedly specular. On the other hand, in open configurations, in long and narrow channels, in configurations with collimated irradiation—whenever there is a possibility of beam channeling—the influence of specularity can be very substantial and must be accounted for.

It is tempting to think of diffuse and specular reflection as not only extreme but also limiting cases: This leads to the thought that—if heat fluxes have been determined for purely diffuse reflection, and again for purely specular reflection—the heat flux for a surface with more irregular reflection behavior must always lie between these two limiting values. This consideration is true in most cases, in particular since most real surfaces tend to have a reflectance maximum near the specular direction. However, there are cases when the actual heat flux is not bracketed by the diffuse and specular reflection models, particularly for directionally selective surfaces. As an example consider the local radiative heat flux from an isothermal groove, such as the one given by Fig. 6- 10. Toor [22] has investigated this problem for diffuse reflectors, for specular reflectors, and for three different types of surface roughnesses analyzed with the Monte Carlo method, and his results are shown in Fig. 6- 17. It is quite apparent that, near the vertex of the groove, diffuse and specular reflectors both seriously overpredict the heat loss. The reason is that, at grazing angles, rough surfaces tend to reflect strongly back into the direction of incidence.

# Problems

6.1 An infinitely long, diffusely reflecting cylinder is opposite a large, infinitely long plate of semiinfinite width (in plane of paper) as shown in the adjacent sketch. The plate is specularly reflecting with  $\rho_{2}^{s} = 0.5$ . As the center of the cylinder moves from  $x = +\infty$  to  $x = - \infty$  plot  $F_{1 - 1}^{s}$  vs. position  $h$  (your plot should include at least three precise values).

6.2 Consider two identical conical cavities (such as the ones depicted next to Problems 6.7 and 6.8), which are identical except for their surface treatment, making one surface a diffuse and the other a specular reflector. If both cones are isothermal, and both lose the same total amount of heat by radiation, which one has the higher temperature?

6.3 Two infinitely long black plates of width  $D$  are separated by a long, narrow channel, as indicated in the adjacent sketch. One plate is isothermal at  $T_{1}$ , the other is isothermal at  $T_{2}$ . The emittance of the insulated channel wall is  $\epsilon$ . Determine the radiative heat flux between the plates if the channel wall is  $(a)$  specular,  $(b)$  diffuse. For simplicity you may treat the channel wall as a single node. The diffuse case approximates the behavior of a light guide, a device used to pipe daylight into interior, windowless spaces.

is  $(a)$  specular,  $(b)$  diffuse. For simplicity you may treat the channel wall as a single node. The diffuse case approximates the behavior of a light guide, a device used to pipe daylight into interior, windowless spaces.

6.4 Two circular black plates of diameter  $D$  are separated by a long, narrow tubular channel, as indicated in the sketch next to Problem 6.3. One disk is isothermal at  $T_{1}$ , the other is isothermal at  $T_{2}$ . The channel wall is a perfect reflector, i.e.,  $\epsilon = 0$ . Determine the radiative heat flux between the disks if the channel wall is (a) specular, (b) diffuse. For simplicity, you may treat the channel wall as a single node. If the channel is made of a transparent material, the specular arrangement approximates the behavior of an optical fiber; if the channel is filled with air, the diffuse case approximates the behavior of a light guide, a device used to pipe daylight into interior, windowless spaces.

6.5 Two infinitely long parallel plates of width  $w$  are spaced  $h = 2w$  apart. Surface 1 has  $\epsilon_{1} = 0.2$  and  $T_{1} = 1000\mathrm{K}$ , Surface 2 has  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.5$  and  $T_{2} = 2000\mathrm{K}$ . Calculate the heat transfer on these plates if (a) the surfaces are diffuse reflectors, (b) the surfaces are specular.

6.6 A long duct has the cross- section of an equilateral triangle with side lengths  $L = 1\mathrm{m}$ . Surface 1 is a diffuse reflector to which an external heat flux at the rate of  $Q_{1}^{\prime} = 1\mathrm{kW / m}$  length of duct is supplied. Surfaces 2 and 3 are isothermal at  $T_{2} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  and  $T_{3} = 500\mathrm{K}$ , respectively, and are purely specular reflectors with  $\epsilon_{1} = \epsilon_{2} = \epsilon_{3} = 0.5$ .

(a) Determine the average temperature of Surface 1, and the heat fluxes for Surfaces 2 and 3. 
(b) How would the results change if Surfaces 2 and 3 were also diffusely reflecting?

6.7 Consider the infinite groove cavity shown. The entire surface of the groove is isothermal at  $T$  and coated with a gray, diffusely emitting material with emittance  $\epsilon$ .

(a) Assuming the coating is a diffuse reflector, what is the total heat loss (per unit length) of the cavity? 
(b) If the coating is a specular reflector, what is the total heat loss for the cavity?

6.8 Consider the infinite groove cavity shown in the adjacent sketch. The entire surface  $(L = 2\mathrm{cm})$  is isothermal at  $T = 1000\mathrm{K}$  and is coated with a gray material whose reflectance may be idealized to consist of purely diffuse and specular components such that  $\epsilon = \rho^{d} = \rho^{s} = \frac{1}{3}$ . What is the total heat loss from the cavity? What is its apparent emittance, defined by

$$
\epsilon_{a} = \frac{\mathrm{total~flux~leaving~cavity}}{\mathrm{area~of~groove~open~ing}\times E_{b}}?
$$

6.9 Determine the temperature of surface  $A_{2}$  in the axisymmetric configuration shown in the adjacent sketch, with the following data:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{A_1:} & {T_1 = 1000\mathrm{K},q_1 = -1\mathrm{W / cm}^2,}\\ & {\epsilon_1 = 0.6\quad (\mathrm{diffuse~reflected});}\\ {A_2:} & {\epsilon_2 = 0.2\quad (\mathrm{specular~reflected});}\\ {A_3:} & {q_3 = 0.0\quad (\mathrm{perfectly~insulated}),}\\ & {\epsilon_3 = 0.3\quad (\mathrm{diffuse~reflected}).} \end{array}
$$

All surfaces are gray and emit diffusely. Note: Some view factors may have to be approximated if integration is to be avoided.

6.10 To calculate the net heat loss from a part of a spacecraft, this part may be approximated by an infinitely long black plate at temperature  $T_{2} = 600\mathrm{K}$ , as shown. Parallel to this plate is an (infinitely long) thin shield that is gray and reflects specularly with the same emittance  $\epsilon_{1}$  on both sides. You may assume the surroundings to be black at  $0\mathrm{K}$ . Calculate the net heat loss from the black plate.

6.11 A long isothermal plate (at  $T_{1}$ ) is a gray, diffuse emitter  $(\epsilon_{1})$  and purely specular reflector, and is used to reject heat into space. To regulate the heat flux the plate is shielded by another (black) plate, which is perfectly insulated as illustrated in the adjacent sketch. Give an expression for heat loss as a function of shield opening angle (neglect variations along plates). At what opening angle  $0 \leq \phi \leq 180^{\circ}$  does maximum heat loss occur?

6.12 Reconsider Problem 6.11, but assume the entire configuration to be isothermal at temperature  $T$ , and covered with a partially diffuse, partially specular material,  $\epsilon = 1 - \rho^{s} - \rho^{d}$ . Determine an expression for the heat lost from the cavity.

6.13 An infinitely long cylinder with a gray, diffuse surface  $(\epsilon_{1} = 0.8)$  at  $T_{1} = 2000\mathrm{K}$  is situated with its axis parallel to an infinite plane with  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.2$  at  $T_{2} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  in a vacuum environment with a background temperature of  $0\mathrm{K}$ . The axis of the cylinder is two diameters from the plane. Specify the heat loss from the cylinder when the plate surface is  $(a)$  gray and diffuse, or  $(b)$  gray and specular.

6.15 Repeat Problem 5.7 for the case that the flat part of the rod  $(A_{1})$  is a purely specular reflector.

6.16 A long furnace may, in a simplified scenario, be considered to consist of a strip plate (the material to be heated,  $A_{1}$ :  $\epsilon_{1} = 0.2$ ,  $T_{1} = 500\mathrm{K}$ , specular reflector), unheated refractory brick (flat sides and bottom,  $A_{2}$ :  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.1$ , diffuse reflector), and a cylindrical dome of heated refractory brick  $(A_{3}$ :  $\epsilon_{3} = 1$ ,  $T_{3} = 1000\mathrm{K}$ ). Heat release inside the heated brick is  $q_{h}$ $(\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{m}^{2})$ . The total heat release is radiated into the furnace cavity and is removed by convection, such that the convective heat loss is uniform everywhere (at  $q_{c}$ $\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$  on all three surfaces).

6.17 A typical space radiator may have a shape as shown in the adjacent sketch, i.e., a small tube to which are attached a number of flat plate fins, spaced at equal angle intervals. Assume that the central tube is negligibly small, and that a fixed amount of specularly- reflecting fin material is available  $\epsilon = \rho^2 = 0.5$ , to give (per unit length of tube) a total, one- sided fin area of  $A' = N \times L$ . Also assume the whole structure to be isothermal. Develop an expression for the total heat loss from the radiator as a function of the number of fins (each fin having length  $L = A' / N$ ). Does an optimum exist? Qualitatively discuss the more realistic case of supplying a fixed amount of heat to the bases of the fins (rather than assuming isothermal fins).

6.21 Reconsider the spacecraft of Problem 6.10. To decrease the heat loss from Surface 2 a specularly reflecting shield, of the same dimensions as the black surface and with emittance  $\epsilon = 0.1$ , is placed between the two plates. Determine the net heat loss from the black plate as a function of shield location. Where would you place the shield?

6.22 Evaluate the normal emittance for the V- corrugated surface shown in Fig. 6- 10a. Hint: This is most easily calculated by determining the normal absorptance, or the net heat flux on a cold groove irradiated by parallel light from the normal direction; see Problem 6.8 for the definition of "apparent emittance."

6.23 Redo Problem 6.22 for an arbitrary off- normal direction  $0 < \theta < \pi / 2$  in a two- dimensional sense (i.e., determine the off- normal absorptance for parallel incoming light whose propagation vector is in the same plane as all the surface normal, namely the plane of the paper in Fig. 6- 10).

6.24 A long, thin heating wire, radiating energy in the amount of  $S' = 300 \mathrm{W / cm}$  (per cm length of wire), is located between two long, parallel plates as shown in the adjacent sketch. The bottom plate is insulated and specularly reflecting with  $\epsilon_2 = 1 - \rho_2^2 = 0.2$ , while the top plate is isothermal at  $T_1 = 300 \mathrm{K}$  and diffusely reflecting with  $\epsilon_1 = 1 - \rho_1^d = 0.5$ . Determine the net radiative heat flux on the top plate.

6.25 A long groove has diffuse walls that are insulated. All surfaces are gray with  $\epsilon = 0.5$ . A parallel beam of radiation,  $q_0 = 1 \mathrm{W / cm^2}$  enters the open end of the cavity in the center line direction, flooding the cavity opening completely.

(a) What is the apparent reflectance of the groove (i.e., how much radiative energy is leaving it), and what is the temperature of surface  $A_1$ ?  
(b) What are these values if surface  $A_1$  is a specular reflector instead of diffuse?

6.26 An infinitely long corner of characteristic length  $w = 1\mathrm{m}$  is a gray, diffuse emitter and purely specular reflector with  $\epsilon = \rho^s = \frac{1}{2}$ . The entire corner is kept at a constant temperature  $T = 500\mathrm{K}$ , and is irradiated externally by a line source of strength  $S' = 20\mathrm{kW / m}$ , located a distance  $w$  away from both sides of the corner, as shown in the sketch. What is the total heat flux  $Q'$  (per  $\mathrm{m}$  length) to be supplied or extracted from the corner to keep the temperature at 500 K?

6.27 A long greenhouse has the cross- section of an equilateral triangle as shown. The side exposed to the sun consists of a thin sheet of glass  $(A_{1})$  with reflectance  $\rho_{1} = 0.1$ . The glass may be assumed perfectly transparent to solar radiation, and totally opaque to radiation emitted inside the greenhouse. The other side wall  $(A_{2})$  is opaque with emittance  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.2$ , while the floor  $(A_{3})$  has  $\epsilon_{3} = 0.8$ . Both walls  $(A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  are specular reflectors, while the floor reflects diffusely. For simplicity, you may assume surfaces  $A_{1}$  and  $A_{2}$  to be perfectly insulated, while the floor loses heat to the ground according to

$$
q_{3,\mathrm{conduction}} = U(T_3 - T_\infty)
$$

where  $T_{\infty} = 280\mathrm{K}$  is the temperature of the ground, and  $U =$

$19.5\mathrm{W / m^2K}$  is an overall heat transfer coefficient. Determine the temperatures of all three surfaces for the case that the sun shines onto the greenhouse with strength  $q_{\mathrm{sun}} = 1000\mathrm{W / m^2}$  in a direction parallel to surface  $A_{2}$ .

6.28 Two long plates, parallel to each other and of width  $w$ , are spaced a distance  $L = \sqrt{5} w / 2$  apart, and are facing each other as shown.

The top plate is a gray, diffuse emitter and diffusely reflecting with emittance  $\epsilon_{2}$  and temperature  $T_{2}$ . The bottom plate is irradiated by the sun as shown (strength  $q_{\mathrm{sol}}[\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}]$ , angle  $\theta$ ). Determine the net heat fluxes on the two plates.

How must the cavity be oriented toward the light source (i.e., what is  $\phi$ )? so that there is no net heat flux on surface  $A_{1}$ ?

# CHAPTER 7

# RADIATIVE EXCHANGE BETWEEN NONIDEAL SURFACES

# 7.1 INTRODUCTION

In Chapter 6 we saw that, in certain situations, the directional nature of the reflectance of surfaces can strongly influence radiative heat transfer rates. This effect occurs particularly in open configurations, in enclosures with long channels, or in applications with collimated irradiation. Since real surfaces are neither diffuse nor specular reflectors, the actual directional behavior may have substantial impact, as we saw from the data in Fig. 6- 17. We also noted that solar collectors did not appear to perform very well because, in our gray analysis, the reradiation losses were rather large. However, experience has shown that reradiation losses can be reduced substantially if selective surfaces (i.e., strongly nongray surfaces) are used for the collector plates. Apparently, there are a substantial number of applications for which our idealized treatment (gray, diffuse—i.e., direction- independent—absorptance and emittance, gray and diffuse or specular reflectance) is not sufficiently accurate. Actual surface properties deviate from our idealized treatment in a number of ways:

1. As seen from the discussion in Chapter 3, radiative properties can vary appreciably across the spectrum. 
2. Spectral properties and, in particular, spectrally averaged properties may depend on the local surface temperature. 
3. Absorptance and reflectance of a surface may depend on the direction of the incoming radiation. 
4. Emittance and reflectance of a surface may depend on the direction of the outgoing radiation. 
5. The components of polarization of incident radiation are reflected differently by a surface. Even for unpolarized radiation this difference can cause errors if many consecutive specular reflections take place. In the case of polarized laser irradiation this effect will always be important.

In this chapter we shall briefly discuss how nongray effects may be incorporated into the analyses of the previous chapters. We shall also develop the governing equation for the intensity leaving the surface of an enclosure with arbitrary radiative properties (spectrally and directionally), from which heat transfer rates may be calculated. This expression will be applied to a simple geometry to show how directionally irregular surface properties may be incorporated in the analysis.

# 7.2 RADIATIVE EXCHANGE BETWEEN NONGRAY SURFACES

In this section we shall consider radiative exchange between nongray surfaces that are directionally ideal: Their absorptances and emittances are independent of direction, while their reflectance is idealized to consist of purely diffuse and/or specular components. For such a situation equation (6.22) becomes, on a spectral basis,

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left[\delta_{ij} - (1 - \rho_{\lambda j}^{s})E_{\lambda ,i - j}^{s}\right]E_{b\lambda j} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left(\frac{\delta_{ij}}{\epsilon_{\lambda j}} -\frac{\rho_{\lambda j}^{d}}{\epsilon_{\lambda j}} F_{\lambda ,i - j}^{s}\right)q_{\lambda j} + H_{o\lambda i}^{s},\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{7.1}
$$

While diffuse view factors are purely geometric quantities and, therefore, never depend on wavelength, the specular view factors depend on the spectral variation of specular reflectances. In principle, equation (7.1) may be solved for all the unknown  $q_{\lambda j}$  and/or  $E_{b\lambda j}$ . This operation is followed by integrating the results over the entire spectrum, leading to

$$
q_{j} = \int_{0}^{\infty}\mathfrak{q}_{j i}d\lambda ,\qquad E_{b j} = \int_{0}^{\infty}E_{b\lambda j}d\lambda . \tag{7.2}
$$

In matrix form this may be written, similar to equation (6.23), as

$$
\mathbf{A}_{\lambda}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{b}\lambda} = \mathbf{C}_{\lambda}\cdot \mathbf{q}_{\lambda} + \mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{o}\lambda}^{s}, \tag{7.3}
$$

where  $\mathbf{A}_{\lambda},\mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{b}\lambda},\mathbf{C}_{\lambda},\mathbf{q}_{\lambda},$  and  $\mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{o}\lambda}^{s}$  are defined as in Chapter 6, but on a spectral basis. Assuming that all the  $q_{j}$  are unknown (and all temperatures are known), equation (7.3) may be solved and integrated as

$$
{\mathfrak{q}}=\int_{0}^{\infty}{\mathfrak{q}}_{\lambda}d\lambda=\int_{0}^{\infty}{\mathbf{C}}_{\lambda}^{-1}\cdot[{\mathbf{A}}_{\lambda}\cdot{\mathbf{e}}_{\mathfrak{b}\lambda}-{\mathfrak{h}}_{\mathbf{o}\lambda}^{s}]d\lambda. \tag{7.4}
$$

A similar expression may be found if the heat flux is specified over some of the surfaces (with temperatures unknown). Branstetter [1] carried out integration of equation (7.4) for two infinite, parallel plates with platinum surfaces. In practice, accurate numerical evaluation of equation (7.4) is considered too complicated for most applications. For every wavelength used in the numerical integration (or quadrature) the matrix  $\mathbf{C}$  needs to be inverted, which—for large numbers of nodes—is generally done by iteration. In addition, if one or more of the surfaces are specular reflectors, the specular view factors need to be recalculated for each wavelength (though not the diffuse view factors of which they are composed). Therefore, nongray effects are usually addressed by simplified models such as the semigray approximation or the band approximation.

# Semigray Approximation

In some applications there is a natural division of the radiative energy within an enclosure into two or more distinct spectral regions. For example, in a solar collector the incoming energy comes from a high- temperature source with most of its energy below  $3\mu \mathrm{m}$ , while radiation losses

![](images/49136bae957fa198380a21574704a62c14010292d8700f18cfbd68f1a058cb5b.jpg)  
FIGURE 7-1 Solar collector geometry for Example 7.1.

for typical collector temperatures are at wavelengths above  $3\mu \mathrm{m}$ . In the case of laser heating and processing the incoming energy is monochromatic (at the laser wavelength), while reradiation takes place over the entire near- to midinfrared (depending on the workpiece temperature), etc. In such a situation equation (6.22) may be split into two sets of  $N$  equations each, one set for each spectral range, and with different radiative properties for each set. For example, consider an enclosure subject to external irradiation, which is confined to a certain spectral range "  $(1)^{\prime \prime}$ . The surfaces in the enclosure, owing to their temperature, emit over spectral range "  $(2)^{\prime \prime}$ . Then from equation (6.22),

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left[\frac{\delta_{ij}}{\epsilon_j^{(1)}} -\frac{\rho_j^{d_{(1)}}}{\epsilon_j^{(1)}} F_{i - j}^{s(1)}\right]a_j^{(1)} + H_{oi}^s = 0,}\\ {\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left[\frac{\delta_{ij}}{\epsilon_j^{(2)}} -\frac{\rho_j^{d_{(2)}}}{\epsilon_j^{(2)}} F_{i - j}^{s(2)}\right]a_j^{(2)} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left[\delta_{ij} - (1 - \rho_j^{s(2)})F_{i - j}^{s(2)}\right]E_{ij},}\\ {q_i = q_i^{(1)} + q_i^{(2)},\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N,} \end{array} \tag{7.5b}
$$

where  $\epsilon_{j}^{(1)}$  is the average emittance for surface  $j$  over spectral interval (1), and so on.

Example 7.1. A very long solar collector plate is to collect energy at a temperature of  $T_{1} = 350\mathrm{K}$ . To improve its performance for off- normal solar incidence, a surface, which is highly reflective at short wavelengths, is placed next to the collector as shown in Fig. 7- 1. For simplicity you may make the following assumptions: (i) The collector  $A_{1}$  is isothermal and a diffuse reflector; (ii) the mirror  $A_{2}$  is a specular reflector; (iii) the spectral properties of the collector and mirror may be approximated as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\epsilon_1 = 1 - \rho_1^d = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0.8, & \lambda < \lambda_c = 4\mu \mathrm{m},\\ 0.1, & \lambda >\lambda_c, \end{array} \right.}\\ {\epsilon_2 = 1 - \rho_2^s = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0.1, & \lambda < \lambda_c,\\ 0.8, & \lambda >\lambda_c, \end{array} \right.} \end{array}
$$

and  $(iv)$  heat losses from the mirror by convection as well as all losses from the collector ends may be neglected. How much energy (per unit length) does the collector plate collect for a solar incidence angle of  $30^{\circ}$ ?

# Solution

From equation (7.5) we find, with  $F_{1 - 2}^{s} = F_{1 - 2}$ ,  $F_{2 - 1}^{s} = F_{2 - 1}$ , and  $F_{1 - 1}^{s} = F_{2 - 2}^{s} = 0$ , for range (1),

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\frac{q_1^{(1)}}{\epsilon_1^{(1)}} +H_{o1}^s = 0,}\\ {-\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1^{(1)}} -1\right)F_{2 - 1}q_1^{(1)} + \frac{q_2^{(1)}}{\epsilon_2^{(1)}} +H_{o2}^s = 0,} \end{array}
$$

and for range (2),

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\frac{q_1^{(2)}}{\epsilon_1^{(2)}} = E_{b1} - \epsilon_2^{(2)}F_{1 - 2}E_{b2},}\\ {-\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1^{(2)}} -1\right)F_{2 - 1}q_1^{(2)} + \frac{q_2^{(2)}}{\epsilon_2^{(2)}} = -F_{2 - 1}E_{b1} + E_{b2}.} \end{array}
$$

Eliminating  $E_{b2}$  from the last two equations, we find

$$
\left[\frac{1}{\epsilon_1^{(2)}} -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1^{(2)}} -1\right)\epsilon_2^{(2)}F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1}\right]q_1^{(2)} + F_{1 - 2}q_2^{(2)} = (1 - \epsilon_2^{(2)}F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1})E_{b1}.
$$

Multiplying the second equation for range (1) by  $\epsilon_2^{(1)}F_{1 - 2}$  results in

$$
\left[-\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1^{(1)}} -1\right)\epsilon_2^{(1)}F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1}q_1^{(1)} + F_{1 - 2}q_2^{(1)} = -\epsilon_2^{(1)}F_{1 - 2}H_{o2}^s.\right.
$$

Adding the last two equations and using  $q_{2} = q_{2}^{(1)} + q_{2}^{(2)} = 0$  then leads to

$$
\left[\frac{1}{\epsilon_1^{(2)}} -\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1^{(2)}} -1\right)\epsilon_2^{(2)}F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1}\right]q_1^{(2)} = \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1^{(1)}} -1\right)\epsilon_2^{(1)}F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1}q_1^{(1)} - \epsilon_2^{(1)}F_{1 - 2}H_{o2}^s +\left(1 - \epsilon_2^{(2)}F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1}\right)E_{b1},
$$

or, with  $q_{1}^{(1)} = - \epsilon_{1}^{(1)}H_{o1}^{s}$

$$
q_{1} = q_{1}^{(1)} + q_{1}^{(2)} = \frac{(1 - \epsilon_{2}^{(2)}F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1})E_{b1} - (1 - \epsilon_{1}^{(1)})\epsilon_{2}^{(1)}F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1}H_{o1}^{s} - \epsilon_{2}^{(1)}F_{1 - 2}H_{o2}^{s}}{1 / \epsilon_{1}^{(2)} - (1 / \epsilon_{1}^{(2)} - 1)\epsilon_{2}^{(2)}F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1}} -\epsilon_{1}^{(1)}H_{o1}^{s}.
$$

From Example 6.5 we have

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & H_{o2}^{s} = q_{\mathrm{sun}}\sin \phi = 1000\times \sin 30^{\circ} = 500\mathrm{W / m}^{2},\\ & H_{o1}^{s} = q_{\mathrm{sun}}\left[\cos \phi +\rho_{2}^{s(1)}\sin \phi (l_{2} / l_{1})\right] = 1000[\cos 30^{\circ} + 0.9\times \sin 30^{\circ}(60 / 80)] = 1203.5\mathrm{W / m}^{2}. \end{array}
$$

With  $F_{1 - 2} = \frac{1}{4}$ ,  $F_{2 - 1} = \frac{1}{3}$ ,  $F_{1 - 2}F_{2 - 1} = \frac{1}{12}$ , and  $E_{b1} = 5.670\times 10^{- 8}\times 350^{4} = 850.9\mathrm{W / m}^{2}$ ,  $q_{1}$  may now be evaluated as

$$
q_{1} = \frac{\left(1 - \frac{0.8}{12}\right)\times 850.9 - \frac{0.2\times 0.1}{12}\times 1203.5 - \frac{0.1}{4}\times 500}{\frac{1}{0.1} - \left(\frac{1}{0.1} - 1\right)\times \frac{0.8}{12}} -0.8\times 1203.5 = 82.9 - 962.8 = -880.1\mathrm{W / m}^{2},
$$

or a collection efficiency of  $88\%$  In addition, surface  $A_{2}$  remains much cooler than for the gray case (Example 6.5); from the first equation for region (2)

$$
E_{b2} = \left(E_{b1} - \frac{q_1^{(2)}}{\epsilon_1^{(2)}}\right)\epsilon_2^{(2)}F_{1 - 2} = \left(850.9 - \frac{82.9}{0.1}\right)\left(\frac{0.8}{4} = 109.5\mathrm{W / m}^2,\right.
$$

or

$$
T_{2} = (E_{b2} / \sigma)^{1 / 4} = \left[109.5 / 5.670\times 10^{-8}\right]^{1 / 4} = 209\mathrm{K}.
$$

Obviously, surface  $A_{2}$  would heat up by convection from the surroundings. Surface emission from  $A_{2}$  would then further improve the collection efficiency.

Thus, selective surfaces can have enormous impact on radiative heat fluxes in configurations with irradiation from high- temperature sources. Subroutine semigray is provided in Appendix F for the solution of the simultaneous equations (7.5), requiring surface information and a partial view factor matrix as input (i.e., the code is limited to two spectral ranges, separating external irradiation from surface emission). The solution to Example 7.1 is also given in the form of program semigrxch, which may be used as a starting point for the solution to other problems. Fortran90, C++ as well as MATLAB® versions are provided.

The semigray approximation is not limited to two distinct spectral regions. Each surface of the enclosure may be given a set of absorptances and reflectances, one value for each different surface temperature (with its different emission spectra). Armaly and Tien [2] have indicated

how such absorptances may be determined. However, while simple and straightforward, the method can never become "exact," no matter how many different values of absorptance and reflectance are chosen for each surface.

Bobco and coworkers [3] have given a general discussion of the semigray approximation. The method has been applied to solar irradiation falling into a V- groove cavity with a spectrally selective, diffusely reflecting surface by Plamondon and Landram [4]. Comparison with exact (i.e., spectrally integrated) results proved the method to be very accurate. Shimoji [5] used the semigray approximation to model solar irradiation onto conical and V- groove cavities whose reflectances had purely diffuse and specular components.

# Band Approximation

Another commonly used method of solving equation (7.1) is the band approximation. In this method the spectrum is broken up into  $M$  bands, over which the radiative properties of all surfaces in the enclosure are constant. Therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{r l r} & {} & {\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left[\delta_{i j} - (1 - \rho_{j}^{s(m)})E_{i - j}^{s(m)}\right]E_{b j}^{(m)} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left[\frac{\delta_{i j}}{\epsilon_{j}^{(m)}} -\frac{\rho_{j}^{d(m)}}{\epsilon_{j}^{(m)}} F_{i - j}^{s(m)}\right]q_{j}^{(m)} + H_{o i}^{s(m)},}\\ & {} & {i = 1,2,\ldots ,N,\quad m = 1,2,\ldots ,M;}\\ & {} & {E_{b j} = \sum_{m = 1}^{M}E_{b j}^{(m)},\quad q_{j} = \sum_{m = 1}^{M}q_{j}^{(m)},\quad H_{o i}^{s} = \sum_{m = 1}^{M}H_{o i}^{s(m)}.} \end{array} \tag{7.6b}
$$

Equation (7.6) is, of course, nothing but a simple numerical integration of equation (7.1), using the trapezoidal rule with varying steps. This method has the advantage that the widths of the bands can be tailored to the spectral variation of properties, resulting in good accuracy with relatively few bands. For very few bands the accuracy of this method is similar to that of the semigray approximation, but is a little more cumbersome to apply, and requires an iterative approach if some surfaces have prescribed radiative flux rather than temperature. On the other hand, the band approximation can achieve any desired accuracy by using many bands.

Example 7.2. Repeat Example 7.1 using the band approximation.

# Solution

Since the emittances in this example have been idealized to have constant values across the spectrum with the exception of a step at  $\lambda = 4\mu \mathrm{m}$ , a two- band approximation  $(\lambda < \lambda_{c} = 4\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $\lambda >4\mu \mathrm{m}$  will produce the "exact" solution (within the framework of the net radiation method). From equation (7.6)

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}{E_{b1}^{(m)} - \epsilon_1^{(m)}F_{1 - 2}E_{b2}^{(m)} =} & {\frac{q_1^{(m)}}{\epsilon_1^{(m)}} +H_{o1}^{s(m)},}\\ {} & {} & {}\\ {-F_{2 - 1}E_{b1}^{(m)} + E_{b2}^{(m)} =} & {-\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1^{(m)}} -1\right)F_{2 - 1}q_1^{(m)} + \frac{q_2^{(m)}}{\epsilon_2^{(m)}} +H_{o2}^{s(m)},} & {m = 1,2,} \end{array}
$$

where  $\begin{array}{r}E_{bi}^{(1)} = \int_{0}^{\lambda_c}E_{b\lambda i}d\lambda = f(\lambda_cT_i)E_{bi}, \end{array}$ $E_{bi}^{(2)} = [1 - f(\lambda_cT_i)]E_{bi},$  etc. These are four equations in the six unknowns  $q_{1}^{(m)},q_{2}^{(m)},E_{b2}^{(m)},m = 1,2$  Two more conditions are obtained from  $q_{2} = q_{2}^{(1)} + q_{2}^{(2)} = 0$  and  $E_{b2}^{(1)} + E_{b2}^{(2)} = E_{b2} = \sigma T_2^4$  The problem is that  $E_{b2}^{(m)}$  are nonlinear relations in  $T_{2},$  making it impossible to find explicit relations for the desired  $q_{1} = q_{1}^{(1)} + q_{1}^{(2)}$  . The system is solved by iteration, by solving for  $q_{i}^{(m)}$  ..

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {q_1^{(m)} = \epsilon_1^{(m)}\left(E_{b1}^{(m)} - \epsilon_2^{(m)}F_{1 - 2}E_{b2}^{(m)} - H_{o1}^{s(m)}\right),}\\ & {q_2^{(m)} = \epsilon_2^{(m)}\left[\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1^{(m)}} -1\right)F_{2 - 1}q_1^{(m)} - F_{2 - 1}E_{b1}^{(m)} + E_{b2}^{(m)} - H_{o2}^{s(m)}\right],m = 1,2.} \end{array}
$$

First,  $T_{2}$  is guessed, from which the  $E_{b2}^{(m)}$  may be evaluated. This computation is followed by determining the  $\ell_1^{(m)}$  , after which the  $q_{1}^{(m)}$  can be calculated. If  $q_{2} > 0,$  surface  $A_{2}$  is too hot and its temperature is reduced and vice versa until the correct temperature is obtained. This calculation may be done by writing a simple computer code, resulting in  $T_{2} = 212\mathrm{K}$  and  $q_{1} = - 867\mathrm{W / m^{2}}$  .As expected, for the present example the band approximation offers little improvement while complicating the analysis. However, the band approximation is the method of choice if no distinct spectral regions are obvious and/or the spectral behavior of properties is more involved.

Subroutine bandapp is provided in Appendix F for the solution of the simultaneous equations (7.6), requiring surface information and a partial view factor matrix as input. The solution to Example 7.2 is also given in the form of a program bandmxch, which may be used as a starting point for the solution to other problems. Fortran90,  $\mathrm{C + + }$  as well as MATLAB® versions are provided. Dunkle and Bevans [6] applied the band approximation to the same problem as Branstetter [1] (infinite, parallel, tungsten plates) as well as to some other configurations, showing that the band approximation generally achieves accuracies of  $2\%$  and better with very few bands, while a gray analysis may result in errors of  $30\%$  or more.

# 7.3 DIRECTIONALLY NONIDEAL SURFACES

In the vast majority of applications the assumption of "directionally ideal" surfaces gives results of sufficient accuracy, i.e., surfaces may be assumed to be diffusely emitting and absorbing and to be diffusely and/or specularly reflecting (with the magnitude of reflectance independent of incoming direction). However, that these results are not always accurate and that heat fluxes are not necessarily bracketed by the diffuse- and specular- reflection cases have been shown in Fig. 6- 17 for V- grooves. There will be situations where  $(i)$  the directional properties,  $(ii)$  the geometrical considerations, and/or  $(iii)$  the accuracy requirements are such that the directional behavior of radiation properties must be addressed.

If radiative properties with arbitrary directional behavior are to be accounted for, it is no longer possible to reduce the governing equation to an integral equation in a single quantity (the radiosity) that is a function of surface location only (but not of direction). Rather, applying conservation of energy to this problem produces an equation governing the directional intensity leaving a surface that is a function of both location on the enclosure surface and direction.

# The Governing Equation for Intensity

Consider the arbitrary enclosure shown in Fig. 7- 2. The spectral radiative heat flux leaving an infinitesimal surface element  $dA'$  into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} '$  and arriving at surface element  $dA$  is

$$
I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}',\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')dA_{p}'d\Omega = I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}',\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')(dA'\cos \theta ')\frac{dA\cos\theta}{S^2}, \tag{7.7}
$$

where  $S = |\mathbf{r}' - \mathbf{r}|$  is the distance between  $dA'$  and  $dA$ ,  $\cos \theta ' = \hat{\mathbf{s}} '\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} '$  is the cosine of the angle between the unit direction vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} ' = (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}') / S$  and the outward surface normal  $\hat{\mathbf{n}} '$  at  $dA'$  and, similarly,  $\cos \theta_{i} = (- \hat{\mathbf{s}} ')\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}$  at  $dA$ . This irradiation at  $dA$  coming from  $dA'$  may also be expressed, from equation (3.32), as

$$
H_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})dAd\Omega_{i} = I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})dAd\cos \theta_{i}\frac{dA^{\prime}\cos\theta^{\prime}}{S^{2}}. \tag{7.8}
$$

Equating these two expressions, we find

$$
I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}) = I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}), \tag{7.9}
$$

that is, the radiative intensity remains unchanged as it travels from  $dA'$  to  $dA$ .

![](images/12ba96d5d5cf8a82a9fa1e5051e0a27ed1161904216d96f934d393a8632147f0.jpg)  
FIGURE 7-2 Radiative exchange in an enclosure with arbitrary surface properties.

The outgoing intensity at  $dA$  into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  consists of two contributions: locally emitted intensity and reflected intensity. The locally emitted intensity is, from equation (3.1),

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda).
$$

The amount of irradiation at  $dA$  coming from  $dA^{\prime}$  [equation (7.8)] that is reflected into a solid angle  $d\Omega_{o}$  around the direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  is, from the definition of the bidirectional reflection function, equation (3.33),

$$
dI_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega_{o} = \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\left(H_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})d\Omega_{i}\right)d\Omega_{o},
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {dI_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\cos \theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}}\\ & {\qquad = \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\frac{\cos\theta_{i}\cos\theta^{\prime}}{S^{2}} dA^{\prime}.} \end{array}
$$

Integrating the reflected intensity over all incoming directions (or over the entire enclosure surface), and adding the locally emitted intensity, we find an expression for the outgoing intensity at  $dA$  as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) + \int_{2\pi}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\cos \theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}}\\ {= \epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) + \int_{A}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\frac{\cos\theta_{i}\cos\theta^{\prime}}{S^{2}} dA^{\prime}.} \end{array} \tag{7.10}
$$

Equation (7.10) is an integral equation for outgoing intensity  $(\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} > 0)$  anywhere on the surface enclosure. Once a solution to equation (7.10) has been obtained (analytically, numerically, or statistically; approximately or "exactly"), the net radiative heat flux is determined from

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) = q_{\mathrm{out}} - q_{\mathrm{in}}}\\ {= \int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}< 0}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}})\cos \theta d\Omega -\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}< 0}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\cos \theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}}\\ {= \int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}< 0}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}})\cos \theta d\Omega -\int_{A}I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\frac{\cos\theta_{i}\cos\theta^{\prime}}{S^{2}} dA^{\prime},} \end{array} \tag{7.11}
$$

or, equivalently, from

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) = q_{\mathrm{em}} - q_{\mathrm{abs}} = \epsilon_{\lambda}E_{b\lambda} - \alpha_{\lambda}H_{\lambda}}\\ {= \int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} >0}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}})\cos \theta d\Omega_{I_{b\lambda}}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) - \int_{A}\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\frac{\cos\theta_{i}\cos\theta^{\prime}}{S^{2}} dA^{\prime}.} \end{array} \tag{7.12}
$$

Both forms of equation (7.10) (solid angle and area integration) may be employed, depending on the problem at hand. For example, if  $dA$  is a diffuse emitter and reflector then, from equation (3.38),  $\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) / \pi$  and, from equation (5.19),  $I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = J_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) / \pi$ . If  $dA^{\prime}$  is also diffuse, we obtain from the second form of equation (7.10)

$$
J_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) = \epsilon_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda)E_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) + \rho_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda)\int_{A}J_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}',\lambda)dF_{dA - dA'}, \tag{7.13}
$$

which is nothing but the spectral form of equation (5.24) without external irradiation.2 Similarly, equation (7.11) reduces to

$$
q_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) = J_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) - \int_{A}J_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}',\lambda)dF_{dA - dA'}, \tag{7.14}
$$

the spectral form of equation (5.25).

On the other hand, if  $dA$  is a specular reflector the first form of equation (7.10) becomes more convenient: For a specular surface we have  $\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime} = 0$  for all  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}$  except for  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime} = \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{s}$ , where  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{s}$  is the "specular direction" from which a beam must originate in order to travel on into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  after specular reflection. For that direction  $\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}\rightarrow \infty$ , and it is clear that the integrand of the integral in equation (7.10) will be nonzero only in the immediate vicinity of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime} = \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{s}$ . In that vicinity  $I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}',\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')$  varies very little and we may remove it from the integral. From the definition of the spectral, directional- hemispherical reflectance, equation (3.37), and the law of reciprocity for the bidirectional reflectance function, equation (3.35), we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\int_{2\pi}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\cos \theta_{i}d\Omega_{i} = I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{\mathrm{s}})\int_{2\pi}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\cos \theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}}\\ & {\qquad = I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{\mathrm{s}})\int_{2\pi}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda , - \hat{\mathbf{s}}, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\cos \theta_{i}d\Omega_{i}}\\ & {\qquad = I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{\mathrm{s}})\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda , - \hat{\mathbf{s}}),} \end{array}
$$

where  $- \hat{\mathbf{s}}$  denotes an incoming direction, pointing toward  $dA$ , and  $\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda , - \hat{\mathbf{s}})$  is the directional- hemispherical reflectance. From the same Kirchhoff's law used to establish equation (3.35), it follows that  $\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda , - \hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{\mathrm{s}})$  and

$$
I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) + \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{\mathrm{s}})I_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{\mathrm{s}}). \tag{7.15}
$$

Example 7.3. Consider a very long  $\nu$  groove with an opening angle of  $2\gamma = 90^{\circ}$  and with optically smooth metallic surfaces with index of refraction  $m = n - ik = 23.452(1 - i)$  i.e., the surfaces are specularly reflecting and their directional dependence obeys Fresnel's equations. The groove is isothermal at temperature  $T$ , and no external irradiation is entering the configuration. Calculate the local net radiative heat loss as a function of the distance from the vertex of the groove.

# Solution

This is one of the problems studied by Toor [7], using the Monte Carlo method (the solid line in Fig. 6- 17). The directional emittance may be calculated from Fresnel's equations for a metal, equations (3.75) and (3.76), as

$$
\epsilon^{\prime}(\theta) = 1 - \rho^{\prime}(\theta) = \frac{2n\cos\theta}{(n + \cos\theta)^{2} + k^{2}} +\frac{2n\cos\theta}{(n\cos\theta + 1)^{2} + (k\cos\theta)^{2}},
$$

FIGURE 7-3 Isothermal V-groove with specularly reflecting, directionally dependent reflectance (Example 7.3).

while the hemispherical emittance follows from equation (3.77) or Fig. 3- 10 as  $\epsilon = 0.1$

The present problem is particularly simple since the surfaces are specular reflectors and since the opening angle of the groove is  $90^{\circ}$  (cf. Fig. 7- 3). Any radiation leaving surface  $A_{1}$  traveling toward  $A_{2}$  will be absorbed by  $A_{2}$  or reflected out of the groove; none can be reflected back to  $A_{1}$ . This fact implies that all radiation arriving at  $A_{1}$  is due to emission from  $A_{2}$ , which is a known quantity. Therefore, for those azimuthal angles  $\psi_{2}$  pointing toward  $A_{1}$  we have

$$
-\frac{\pi}{2} < \psi_{2}< \frac{\pi}{2}:I_{2}(\theta_{2}) = \epsilon^{\prime}(\theta_{2})I_{b},
$$

and the local heat flux follows from equation (7.12) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q(x) = \epsilon E_b - \int_{2\pi}\epsilon '(\theta_1)I_2(\theta_2)\cos \theta_1d\Omega_1}\\ {= \epsilon E_b - 2\int_{\psi_1 = 0}^{\pi /2}\int_{\theta_1 = \theta_{\mathrm{min}}(\psi_1)}^{\pi /2}\epsilon '(\theta_1)\epsilon '(\theta_2)I_b\cos \theta_1\sin \theta_1d\theta_1d\psi_1,} \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\frac{q(x)}{\epsilon E_b} = 1 - \frac{2}{\pi\epsilon}\int_{\psi_1 = 0}^{\pi /2}\int_{\theta_1 = \theta_{\mathrm{min}}(\psi_1)}^{\pi /2}\epsilon '(\theta_1)\epsilon '(\theta_2)\cos \theta_1\sin \theta_1d\theta_1d\psi_1.
$$

Here the limits on the integral express the fact that the solid angle, with which  $A_{2}$  is seen from  $A_{1}$ , is limited. It remains to express  $\theta_{1\mathrm{min}}$  as well as  $\theta_{2}$  in terms of  $\theta_{1}$  and  $\psi_{1}$ . From Fig. 7- 3 it follows that

$$
\cos \theta_{1} = \frac{y}{S},\quad \cos \theta_{2} = \frac{x}{S},\quad S\sin \theta_{1} = \frac{x}{\cos\psi_{1}}.
$$

From these three relations and the fact that the minimum value of  $\theta_{1}$  occurs when  $y = L$ , we find

$$
\cos \theta_{2} = \sin \theta_{1}\cos \psi_{1}\quad \mathrm{and}\quad \theta_{1\mathrm{min}}(\psi_{1}) = \tan \cdot \frac{x}{L\cos\psi_{1}}.
$$

Using Fresnel's equation for the directional emittance, the nondimensional local heat flux  $q(x) / \epsilon E_{b}$  may now be calculated using numerical integration. The resulting heat flux is shown as the solid line in Fig. 6- 17. This result should be compared with the simpler case of diffuse emission, or  $\epsilon^{\prime}(\theta) = \epsilon = 0.1 =$  const. For that case the integral above is readily integrated analytically, resulting in the dash- dotted line of Fig. 6- 17. The two results are very close, with a maximum error of  $\simeq 2\%$  near the vertex of the groove.

While the evaluation of the "exact" heat flux, using Fresnel's equations, was quite straightforward in this very simple problem, these calculations are normally much, much more involved than the diffuse- emission approximation. Before embarking on such extensive calculations it is important to ask oneself whether employing Fresnel's equations will lead to substantially different results for the problem at hand.

Few numerical solutions of the exact integral equations have appeared in the literature. For example, Hering and Smith [8] considered the same problem as Example 7.3, but for varying opening angles and for rough surface materials (with the bidirectional reflection function as given in an earlier paper [9]). Lack of detailed knowledge of bidirectional reflection distributions, as well as the enormous complexity involved in the solution of the integral equation (7.10), makes it necessary in practice to make additional simplifying assumptions or to employ a different approach, such as the Monte Carlo method (to be discussed in Chapter 8).

# Net Radiation Method

It is possible to apply the net radiation method to surfaces with directionally nonideal properties, although its application is considerably more difficult and restrictive. Breaking up the enclosure into  $N$  subsurfaces we may write equation (7.10), for  $\mathbf{r}$  pointing to a location on subsurface  $A_{i}$ , as

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \epsilon^{\prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{b}(\mathbf{r},\lambda) + \pi \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\rho_{j}^{\prime \prime}(\mathbf{r},\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{j}(\mathbf{r},\lambda)E_{di - j}(\mathbf{r}), \tag{7.16}
$$

where we have dropped the subscript  $\lambda$  for simplicity of notation, and where  $\rho_{j}^{\prime \prime}$  and  $I_{j}$  are "suitable" average values between point  $\mathbf{r}$  and surface  $A_{j}$ . Averaging equation (7.16) over  $A_{i}$  leads to

$$
I_{i}(\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \epsilon_{i}^{\prime}(\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{bi}(\lambda) + \pi \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\rho_{ji}^{\prime}(\lambda ,\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{ji}(\lambda)E_{i - j},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{7.17}
$$

Here  $I_{ji}$  is an average value of the intensity leaving surface  $A_{j}$  traveling toward  $A_{i}$ , and  $\rho_{ji}^{\prime}$  is a corresponding value for the bidirectional reflection function. If we assume that the enclosure temperature and surface properties are known everywhere, then equation (7.17) has  $N$  unknown intensities  $I_{ji}$ $(j = 1,2,\ldots ,N)$  for each subsurface  $A_{i}$ . Thus, if equation (7.17) is averaged over all the solid angles with which subsurface  $A_{k}$  is seen from  $A_{i}$ , it becomes a set of  $N\times N$  equations in the  $N^{2}$  unknown  $I_{ik}$ :

$$
I_{ik}(\lambda) = \epsilon_{ik}(\lambda)I_{bi}(\lambda) + \pi \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\rho_{jik}(\lambda)I_{ji}(\lambda)E_{i - j},\quad i,k = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{7.18}
$$

Here  $\rho_{jik}$  is an average value of the bidirectional reflection function for radiation traveling from  $A_{j}$  to  $A_{k}$  via reflection at  $A_{i}$ . For a diffusely emitting, absorbing, and reflecting enclosure we have  $\epsilon_{ik} = \epsilon_{i}$ ,  $\pi \rho_{jik} = \rho_{i}$ , and equation (7.18) becomes, with  $I_{ji} = I_{j} = J_{j} / \pi$ ,

$$
J_{i} = \epsilon_{i}E_{bi} + \rho_{i}\sum_{j = 1}^{N}J_{j}F_{i - j},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{7.19}
$$

which is identical to equations (5.30) and (5.31) (without external irradiation).

If the  $N$  subsurfaces are relatively small (as compared with the distance- squared between them), average properties  $\epsilon_{ik}$  and  $\rho_{jik}$  may be obtained simply by evaluating  $\epsilon^{\prime}$  and  $\rho^{\prime \prime}$  at the directions given by connecting the centerpoints of surface  $A_{i}$  with  $A_{j}$  and  $A_{k}$ . For larger subsurfaces a more elaborate averaging may be desirable. A discussion on that subject has been given by Bevans and Edwards [10].

![](images/d15a9997fcae10e36a4636976bf3d55032a6df80b4e22d7a6c5d478223d2d6ce.jpg)  
FIGURE 7-4 (a) Geometry for Example 7.4, (b) bidirectional reflection function in plane of incidence for  $\theta_{i} = 0^{\circ}$  and  $\theta_{i} = 45^{\circ}$ , for the material of Example 7.4.

Once the  $N^2$  unknown  $I_{ik}$  have been determined, the average heat flux on  $A_{i}$  may be calculated from equations (7.18) and (7.11) or (7.12) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q_i(\lambda) = \pi \sum_{k = 1}^{N}I_{ik}(\lambda)E_{i - k} - \pi \sum_{j = 1}^{N}I_{ji}(\lambda)E_{i - j} = \pi \sum_{j = 1}^{N}(I_{ij} - I_{ji})E_{i - j}}\\ {= \epsilon_i(\lambda)E_{bi}(\lambda) - \pi \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\alpha_{ij}(\lambda)I_{ji}(\lambda)E_{i - j},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N,} \end{array} \tag{7.20b}

where  $\epsilon_{i}$  is the hemispherical emittance of  $A_{i}$  and  $\alpha_{ij}$  is the average absorptance of subsurface  $A_{i}$  for radiation coming from  $A_{j}$ .

It is apparent from equations (7.10) and (7.18) that the net radiation method for directionally nonideal surfaces is valid  $(i)$  if each  $I_{bi}$  varies little over each subsurface  $A_{i}$ ,  $(ii)$  if each  $I_{ik}$  varies little between any two positions on  $A_{i}$  and  $A_{k}$ , and  $(iii)$  if similar restrictions apply to  $\epsilon_{ik}$ ,  $\alpha_{ij}$ , and  $\rho_{jik}$ . Restrictions  $(ii)$  and  $(iii)$  are likely to be easily violated unless the surfaces are near- diffuse reflectors or are very small (as compared with the distance between them).

Equations (7.10) and (7.18) are valid for an enclosure with gray surface properties, or on a spectral basis. For nongray surface properties the governing equations are readily integrated over the spectrum using the methods outlined in the previous section.

To illustrate the difficulties associated with directionally nonideal surfaces, we shall consider one particularly simple example.

Example 7.4. Consider the isothermal corner of finite length as depicted in Fig. 7- 4a. The surface material is similar to the one of the infinitely long corner of the previous example, i.e., the absorptance and emittance obey Fresnel's equations with  $m = n - ik = 23.452(1 - i)$ , and a hemispherical emittance of  $\epsilon = 0.1$ . However, in the present example we assume that the material is reflecting in a nonspecular fashion with a bidirectional reflection function of

$$
\rho ''(\pmb {\hat{s}}_i,\pmb {\hat{s}}_r) = \frac{\rho'(\pmb{\hat{s}}_i)}{\pi C_n(\pmb{\hat{s}}_i)} (1 + \pmb {\hat{s}}_s\cdot \pmb {\hat{s}}_r)^n,
$$

where  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  is the direction of incoming radiation,  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_s$  is the specular reflection direction (i.e.,  $\theta_{s} = \theta_{i}, \psi_{s} = \psi_{i} + \pi$ ), and  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r$  is the actual direction of reflection. This form of the bidirectional reflection function describes a surface that has a reflectance maximum in the specular direction, and whose reflectance

drops off equally in all directions away from the specular direction (i.e., with changing polar angle and/or azimuthal angle). Since the directional- hemispherical reflectance must obey  $\rho^{\prime}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = 1 - \epsilon^{\prime}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i),$  the function  $C_n(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)$  follows from equation (3.37) as

$$
C_n(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{2\pi}(1 + \hat{\mathbf{s}}_s\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_r)^n\cos \theta_r d\Omega_r.
$$

Determine the local radiative heat loss rates from the plates for the case that both plates are isothermal at the same temperature.

# Solution

The direction vectors  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  may be expressed in terms of polar angle  $\theta$  and azimuthal angle  $\psi$ , or  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \sin \theta (\cos \psi \hat{\mathbf{t}}_1 + \sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{t}}_2) + \cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{n}}$ , where  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$  is the unit surface normal and  $\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{t}}_2$  are two perpendicular unit vectors tangential to the surface. Therefore, the bidirectional reflection function may be written as

$$
\rho^{\prime \prime}(\theta_{i},\psi_{i},\theta_{r},\psi_{r}) = \frac{\rho^{\prime}(\theta_{i},\psi_{i})}{\pi C_{n}(\theta_{i})}\left[1 + \cos \theta_{i}\cos \theta_{r} - \sin \theta_{i}\sin \theta_{r}\cos (\psi_{i} - \psi_{r})\right]^{n}, \tag{7.21a}
$$

$$
C_{n}(\theta_{i}) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi /2}(1 + \cos \theta_{i}\cos \theta +\sin \theta_{i}\sin \theta \cos \psi)^{n}\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\psi . \tag{7.21b}
$$

The bidirectional reflection function within the plane of incidence  $(\psi_{r} = \psi$  or  $\psi_{i} + \pi)$  is shown in Fig. 7- 4b for two different incidence directions and three different values of  $n$ . Obviously, for  $n = 0$  the surface reflects diffusely (but the amount of reflection, as well as absorption and emission, depends on direction through Fresnel's equation). As  $n$  grows, the surface becomes more specular, and purely specular reflection would be reached with  $n\to \infty$ . For this configuration and surface material we should like to determine the heat lost from the plates using the net radiation method.

As indicated in Fig. 7- 4a we shall apply the net radiation method, equations (7.18) and (7.20), by breaking up each surface into  $M\times N$  subsurfaces ( $M$  divisions in the  $x$ - and  $y$ - directions,  $N$  in the  $z$ - direction). Considering the intensity at node  $(i,k)$  on the bottom surface directed toward node  $(j_0,k_0)$  on the vertical wall, we find that equation (7.18) becomes, after division by  $I_b$ ,

$$
\Phi_{i,k\rightarrow j_o,k_o} = \frac{I_{ik\rightarrow j_0,k_o}}{I_b} = \epsilon_{i,k\rightarrow j_o,k_o} + \sum_{j_i = 1}^{M}\sum_{k = 1}^{N}\pi \rho_{j_i,k_i\rightarrow i,k\rightarrow j_o,k_o}F_{i,k\rightarrow j_i,k_i}F_{j_i,k_i\rightarrow i,k}. \tag{7.22}
$$

In this relation we have made use of the fact that a node on the bottom surface can only see nodes on the side wall and vice versa. Also, by symmetry we have

and

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}{\Phi_{i,k\rightarrow j_o,k_o}} & = & {\Phi_{j,k\rightarrow i_o,k_o}\quad \mathrm{if}\quad j = i\quad \mathrm{and}\quad i_o = j_o,}\\ {} & {} & {}\\ {\Phi_{i,k\rightarrow j_o,k_o}} & = & {\Phi_{i,N + 1\rightarrow k\rightarrow j_o,N + 1 - k_o},} \end{array}
$$

that is, the intensity must be symmetric to the two planes  $x = y$  and  $z = L / 2$ . We, therefore, have a total of  $M\times (N / 2)$  unknowns (assuming  $N$  to be even) and need to apply equation (7.22) for  $i = 1,2,\ldots ,M$  and  $k = 1,2,\ldots ,N / 2$ . To calculate the necessary  $\epsilon^{\prime}$  and  $\rho^{\prime \prime}$  values, one must establish a number of polar and azimuthal angles. From Fig. 7- 4a it follows that

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}{(\cos \theta_i)_{i,k\rightarrow j_i,k_i}} & = & {\frac{y_{j_i}}{\sqrt{x_i^2 + y_{j_i}^2 + (z_k - z_{k_i})^2}},}\\ {(\cos \theta_r)_{i,k\rightarrow j_o,k_o}} & = & {\frac{y_{j_o}}{\sqrt{x_i^2 + y_{j_o}^2 + (z_k - z_{k_o})^2}}.} \end{array}
$$

Using the values for  $(\cos \theta_r)_{i,k\rightarrow j_o,k_o}$  one can readily calculate the directional emittances  $\epsilon_{i,k\rightarrow j_o,k_o} = 1 - \rho^{\prime}(\cos \theta_r)$  from Fresnel's equation as given in Example 7.3. Similarly,  $\rho^{\prime}(\cos \theta_{i})$  and  $C_n(\cos \theta_i)$  are determined from Fresnel's equation and equation (7.21), respectively; and all values of  $\rho_{j_i,k_i\rightarrow i,k\rightarrow j_o,k_o}$  follow from equation (7.21). All necessary view factors may be calculated from equation (4.41), for

arbitrarily oriented perpendicular plates. For all view factors the opposing surfaces are of identical and constant size with  $x_{2} - x_{1} = y_{2} - y_{1} = w / M$  and  $z_{1} = z_{3} - z_{2} = L / N$ . Offsets  $x_{1}$  and  $y_{1}$  may vary between 0 and  $(M - 1)w / M$  and  $z_{2}$  between 0 and  $(N - 1)L / N$ . Thus, using symmetry and reciprocity, one must evaluate a total of  $(M / 2) \times M \times N$  view factors. In many of today's workstations and computers all different values of directional emittance, the factor  $\rho^{\prime} / C_{w}$  in the bidirectional reflection function, and all view factors may be calculated—once and for all—and stored (requiring memory allocation for often millions of numbers). The bidirectional reflection function itself depends on surface locations and on all possible incoming as well as all possible outgoing directions. Even after employing symmetry and reciprocity (for the bidirectional reflection function), this would require storing  $[M \times (N / 2)] \times [M \times N]^{2} / 2 = (MN)^{3} / 4$  numbers. Unless relatively few subdivisions are used (say  $M, N < 10$ ), it will be impossible to precalculate and store values of the bidirectional reflection function; rather, part of it must be recalculated every time it is required.

The nondimensional intensities are now easily found from equation (7.22) by successive approximation: A first guess for the intensity field is made by setting  $\Phi_{i,k \to j_{i}, k_{b}} = \epsilon_{i,k \to j_{i}, k_{b}}$ . Improved values for  $\Phi_{i,k \to j_{i}, k_{b}}$  are found by evaluating equation (7.22) again and again until the intensities have converged to within specified error bounds. The local net radiative heat flux may then be determined from equation (7.20b) as

$$
\Psi_{i,k} = \frac{q_{i,k}}{\epsilon E_b} = 1 - \frac{1}{\epsilon}\sum_{j_1 = 1}^{M}\sum_{k_1 = 1}^{N}\epsilon_{i,k\rightarrow j_i,k_i}F_{i,k\rightarrow j_i,k_i}\Phi_{j_1,k_1\rightarrow i,j_k}.
$$

Some representative results for the local radiative heat flux near  $z = L / 2$  (i.e., for  $k = N / 2$ ) are shown in Fig. 7- 5 for the case of  $w = L$  (square plates). Clearly, taking into consideration substantially different reflective properties has rather small effects on the local heat transfer rates. Obviously, as the surface becomes more specular (increasing  $n$ ) the heat loss rates increase (since less radiation will be reflected back to the emitting surface), but the increases are very minor except for the region close to the vertex (and even there, they are less than  $4\%$ ).

The directional distribution of the emittance is just as important as that of the bidirectional reflection function: The curve labeled "diffuse" shows the case of diffuse emission and reflection, i.e.,  $\epsilon^{\prime}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \alpha^{\prime}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \epsilon = 0.1$  and  $\pi \rho^{\prime \prime}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r) = \rho^{\prime} = 1 - \epsilon = 0.9$ . In contrast, the curve labeled "Fresnel,  $n = 0^{\prime \prime}$  corresponds to the case of  $\epsilon^{\prime}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \alpha^{\prime}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = 1 - \rho^{\prime}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})$  evaluated from Fresnel's equation and  $\pi \rho (\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r) = \rho^{\prime}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)$ . All lines in Fig. 7- 5 have been calculated by breaking up each surface into  $20 \times 20$  subsurfaces. Also included are the data points for results obtained by breaking up each surface into only  $2 \times 2$  (solid symbols) and  $4 \times 4$  surfaces (open symbols). Local heat fluxes are predicted accurately with few subsurfaces, even for

strongly nondiffuse reflection. Total heat loss is predicted even more accurately, with maximum errors of  $< 0.6\%$ $2\times 2$  subsurfaces) and  $< 0.3\%$ $4\times 4$  subsurfaces), respectively.

The results should be compared with those of Toor [7] for  $w / L\rightarrow 0,$  as shown in Fig. 6- 17: The "diffuse" case of Fig. 7- 5 virtually coincides with the corresponding case in Fig. 6- 17, while the  $n = 8$  case falls very close to the specular case with Fresnel- varying reflectance of Toor (solid line in Fig. 6- 17).

For the present example at least, taking into account the directional behavior of emittance and reflectance is rarely justifiable in view of the additional complexity and computational effort required. Only if the radiative properties are known with great accuracy, and if heat fluxes need to be determined with similar accuracy, should this type of analysis be attempted. Similar statements may be made for most other configurations. For example, if Example 7.4 is recalculated for directly opposed parallel quadratic plates, the effects of Fresnel's equation and the bidirectional reflection function are even less: Heat fluxes for diffuse reflection—whether Fresnel's equation is used or not—differ by less than  $0.6\%$ , while differences due to the value of  $n$  in the bidirectional reflection function never exceed  $0.2\%$ . Only in configurations with collimated irradiation and/or strong beam- channeling possibilities should one expect substantial impact as a result of the directional variations of surface properties.

# 7.4 ANALYSIS FOR ARBITRARY SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS

The discussion in the previous two sections has demonstrated that the evaluation of radiative transfer rates in enclosures with nonideal surface properties, while relatively straightforward to formulate, is considerably more complex and time- consuming. If one considers nongray surface properties, the computational effort increases roughly by a factor of  $M$  if  $M$  spectral bands (band approximation) or  $M$  sets of property values (semigray approximation) are employed. In an analysis with directional properties for an enclosure with  $N$  subsurfaces, the computational effort is increased roughly by a factor of  $N$  (an enormous increase if a substantial number of subdivisions are made). If the radiative properties are both nongray and directionally varying, the problem becomes even more difficult. While it is relatively simple to combine the methods of the previous two sections for the analysis of an enclosure with such surface properties, to the author's knowledge this has not yet been done in any reported work. Few analytical solutions for such problems can be found (for the very simplest of geometries), and even standard numerical techniques may fail for nontrivial geometries; because of the four- dimensional character, huge matrices would have to be inverted. Therefore, such calculations are normally carried out with statistical methods such as the Monte Carlo method (to be discussed in detail in Chapter 8). For example, Toor [7] has studied the radiative interchange between simply arranged flat surfaces having theoretically determined directional surface properties; Modest and Poon [11] and Modest [12] evaluated the heat rejection and solar absorption rates of the U.S. Space Shuttle's heat rejector panels, using nongray and directional properties determined from experimental data. The validity and accuracy of several directional models have been tested and verified experimentally by Toor and Wiskanta [13,14]. They studied radiative transfer among three simply arranged parallel rectangles, comparing experimental results with a simple analysis employing (i) the semigray model, (ii) Fresnel's equation for the evaluation of directional properties, and (iii) reflectances consisting of purely diffuse and specular parts. They found good agreement with experiment and concluded that, for the gold surfaces studied, (i) directional effects are more pronounced than nongray effects, and (ii) in the presence of one or more diffusely reflecting surfaces the effects of specularity of other surfaces become unimportant.

Employing a combination of band approximation and the net radiation method has the disadvantage that (i) either large amounts of directional properties and/or view factors must be calculated repeatedly in the iterative solution process (making the method numerically inefficient), or (ii) large amounts of precalculated properties and/or view factors must be stored

(requiring enormous amounts of computer storage). In addition, this method tends to have a voracious appetite for computer CPU time. On the other hand, it avoids the statistical scatter that is always present in Monte Carlo solutions. In light of today's rapid development in the computer field, with many small workstations and personal computers boasting internal storage capacities of several gigabytes, as well as enormous number- crunching capabilities, it appears that the methods discussed in this chapter may become attractive alternatives to the Monte Carlo method.

# Problems

7.1 Two identical circular disks of diameter  $D = 1\mathrm{m}$  are connected at one point of their periphery by a hinge. The configuration is then opened by an angle  $\phi$ . Disk 1 is a diffuse reflector, but emits and absorbs according to

$$
\begin{array}{r}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0.95\cos \theta , & \lambda \leq 3\mu \mathrm{m},\\ 0.5, & \lambda >3\mu \mathrm{m}. \end{array} \right. \end{array}
$$

Disk 2 is black. Both disks are insulated. Assuming the opening angle to be  $\phi = 60^{\circ}$ , calculate the average equilibrium temperature for each of the two disks, with solar radiation entering the configuration parallel to Disk 2 with a strength of  $q_{\mathrm{sun}} = 1000\mathrm{W / m}^2$ .

7.6 A cubical enclosure has five of its surfaces maintained at  $300\mathrm{K}$ , while the sixth is isothermal at  $1200\mathrm{K}$ . The entire enclosure is coated with a material that emits and reflects diffusely with

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0.2, & 0\leq \lambda < 4\mu \mathrm{m},\\ 0.8, & 4\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < \infty . \end{array} \right.

$$

The line source consists of a long filament at  $2500\mathrm{K}$  inside a quartz tube, i.e., the source behaves like a gray body for  $\lambda < 2.5\mu \mathrm{m}$  but has no emission beyond  $2.5\mu \mathrm{m}$ .

$$

7.11 Consider the configuration shown, consisting of a conical cavity  $A_{1}$  and an opposing circular disk with a hole at the center, as shown  $(d = 1\mathrm{cm})$ . Defocused laser radiation at  $10.6\mu \mathrm{m}$  enters the configuration through the hole in the disk as shown, the beam having a strength of  $q_{L} = 10^{3}\mathrm{W / cm^{2}}$ . The down- facing disk  $A_{2}$  is a gray, diffuse material with  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.1$ , and is perfectly insulated (toward top). Surface  $A_{1}$  is kept at a constant temperature of  $500\mathrm{K}$ . No other external surfaces or sources affect the heat transfer.

7.12 During a materials processing experiment on the Space Shuttle (under microgravity conditions) a platinum sphere of  $3\mathrm{mm}$  diameter is levitated in a large, cold black vacuum chamber. A spherical aluminum shield (with a circular cutout) is placed around the sphere as shown, to reduce heat loss from the sphere. Initially, the sphere is at  $200\mathrm{K}$  and is suddenly irradiated with a laser providing an irradiation of  $100\mathrm{W}$  (normal to beam) to raise its temperature rapidly to its melting point  $(27\pm 1\mathrm{K})$ . Determine the time required to reach the melting point. You may assume the sphere to be essentially isothermal at all times, and the shield to have zero heat capacity. The platinum and aluminum may be taken as diffuse emitters and reflectors with

$$
\begin{array}{l}\epsilon_{Pt} = \epsilon_{Pt,0}\sqrt{\frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda}}\qquad \epsilon_{Pt,0} = 0.25,\qquad \lambda_0 = 2\mu \mathrm{m},\\ \displaystyle \epsilon_{Al} = \epsilon_{Al,0}\sqrt{\frac{\lambda_0}{\lambda}}\qquad \epsilon_{Al,0} = 0.1,\qquad \lambda_0 = 2\mu \mathrm{m}. \end{array}
$$

(a) Use the semigray approximation, using gray values for reemission from sphere and shield. 
(b) Use the band approximation, splitting the spectrum into three appropriate bands.

7.13 In the solar energy laboratory at UC Merced parabolic concentrators are employed to enhance the absorption of tubular solar collectors as shown in the sketch. Assume that solar energy enters the cavity normal to the opening, with a strength of  $q_{\mathrm{sun}} = 1000\mathrm{W / m^2}$  (per unit area normal to the rays). The parabolic receiver is coated with a highly reflective gray, diffuse material with  $\epsilon_{1} = 0.05$ , and is kept cold by convection (i.e., emission from it is negligible). Calculate the collected solar energy as a function of tube outer temperature (say, for  $300\mathrm{K}$ ,  $400\mathrm{K}$ ,  $500\mathrm{K}$ ).

(a) assuming the tube to be gray with emittance  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.90$ , 
(b) assuming the tube to be covered with black nickel, using the 2-band approach.

It is sufficient to treat tube and concentrator each as single zones.

7.14 A small spherical heat source outputting  $Q_{s} = 10\mathrm{kW}$  power, spreading equally into all directions, is encased in a reflector as shown, consisting of a hemisphere of radius  $R = 40\mathrm{cm}$ , plus a ring of radius  $R$  and height  $h = 30\mathrm{cm}$ . The arrangement is used to heat a disk of radius  $= 25\mathrm{cm}$  a distance of  $L = 30\mathrm{cm}$  below the reflector. Reflector  $A_{2}$  is gray and diffuse with emittance of  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.1$  and is insulated. Disk  $A_{1}$  is diffuse and coated with a selective absorber, i.e.,

$$
\epsilon_{1\lambda} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0.8, & 0\leq \lambda < 3\mu \mathrm{m},\\ 0.2, & 3\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < \infty . \end{array} \right.
$$

The source is of the tungsten- halogen type, i.e., the spectral variation of its emissive power follows that of a blackbody at  $4000\mathrm{K}$ .

$$
\epsilon^{\prime}(\theta_{i}) = \alpha^{\prime}(\theta_{i}) = 1 - \rho^{\prime}(\theta_{i}) = \epsilon_{n}\cos \theta_{i}
$$

and a hemispherical emittance of  $\epsilon = 0.5$ . Reflection is neither diffuse nor specular, but the bidirectional reflection function of the material is

$$
\rho ''(\theta_i,\theta_r) = \frac{3}{2\pi}\rho '(0_i)\cos \theta_r.
$$

Write a small computer program to determine the total heat lost (per unit length) from each plate. Compare with the case for a diffusely emitting/reflecting surface.

# CHAPTER 8

# THE MONTE CARLO METHOD FOR SURFACE EXCHANGE

# 8.1 INTRODUCTION

Very few exact, closed- form solutions to thermal radiation problems exist, even in the absence of a participating medium. Under most circumstances the solution has to be found by numerical means. For most engineers, who are used to dealing with partial differential equations, this implies use of finite difference and finite element techniques. These methods are, of course, applicable to thermal radiation problems whenever a solution method is chosen that transforms the governing equations into sets of partial differential equations. For surface exchange, however, radiative transfer is governed by integral equations, which may be solved numerically by employing numerical quadrature for the evaluation of integrals, or more approximately using the "net radiation method" of the previous three chapters. With these techniques the solutions to relatively simple problems are readily found. However, if the geometry is involved, and/or if radiative properties vary with direction, then a solution by conventional numerical techniques may quickly become extremely involved if not impossible.

Many mathematical problems may also be solved by statistical methods, through sampling techniques, to any degree of accuracy. For example, consider predicting the outcome of the next presidential elections. Establishing a mathematical model that would predict voter turnout and voting behavior is, of course, impossible, let alone finding the analytical solution to such a model. However, if an appropriate sampling technique is chosen, the outcome can be predicted by conducting a poll. The accuracy of its prediction depends primarily on the sample size, i.e., how many people have been polled. Solving mathematical problems statistically always involves the use of random numbers, which may be picked, e.g., by placing a ball into a spinning roulette wheel. For this reason these sampling methods are called Monte Carlo methods (named after the principality of Monte Carlo in the south of France, famous for its casino). There is no single scheme to which the name Monte Carlo applies. Rather, any method of solving a mathematical problem with an appropriate statistical sampling technique is commonly referred to as a Monte Carlo method.

Problems in thermal radiation are particularly well suited to solution by a Monte Carlo technique, since energy travels in discrete parcels (photons) over (usually) relatively long distances along a (usually) straight path before interaction with matter. Thus, solving a thermal radiation problem by Monte Carlo implies tracing the history of a statistically meaningful random sample of photons from their points of emission to their points of absorption. The advantage of the

FIGURE 8-1Comparison of Monte Carlo and conventional solution techniques.

Monte Carlo method is that even the most complicated problem may be solved with relative ease, as schematically indicated in Fig. 8- 1. For a trivial problem, setting up the appropriate photon sampling technique alone may require more effort than finding the analytical solution. As the complexity of the problem increases, however, the complexity of formulation and the solution effort increase much more rapidly for conventional techniques. For problems beyond a certain complexity, the Monte Carlo solution will be preferable. Unfortunately, there is no way to determine a priori precisely where this crossover point in complexity lies. The disadvantage of Monte Carlo methods is that, as statistical methods, they are subject to statistical error (very similar to the unavoidable error associated with experimental measurements).

The name and the systematic development of Monte Carlo methods dates from about 1944 [1], although some crude mathematical sampling techniques were used off and on during previous centuries. Their first use as a research tool stems from the attempt to model neutron diffusion in fission material, for the development of the atomic bomb during World War II. The method was first applied to thermal radiation problems in the early 1960s by Fleck [2, 3] and Howell and Perlmutter [4- 6].

For a thorough understanding of Monte Carlo methods, a good background in statistical methods is necessary, which goes beyond the scope of this book. In this chapter the method as applied to thermal radiation is outlined, and statistical considerations are presented in an intuitive way rather than in a rigorous mathematical fashion. For a more detailed description, the reader may want to consult the books by Hammersley and Handscomb [1], Cashwell and Everett [7], and Schreider [8], or the monographs by Kahn [9], Brown [10], Halton [11], and Hajji- Sheikh [12]. A first monograph dealing specifically with Monte Carlo methods as applied to thermal radiation has been given by Howell [13]. Another more recent one by Walters and Buckius [14] emphasizes the treatment of scattering. An exhaustive review of the literature up until 1997, that uses some form of radiative Monte Carlo analysis, has been given also by Howell [15]. Since then a large number of researchers have applied Monte Carlo simulations to a vast array of problems, ranging from nanoscale radiation properties to large- scale tomography, surface radiation, participating media, transient radiation, combined modes heat transfer, etc., too numerous to review in this book.

# Probability Distributions

When a political poll is conducted, people are not selected at random from a telephone directory. Rather, people are randomly selected from different groups according to probability distributions, to ensure that representative numbers of barbers, housewives, doctors, smokers, gun owners, bald people, heat transfer engineers, etc. are included in the poll. Similarly, in order to follow the history of radiative energy bundles in a statistically meaningful way, the points, directions

and wavelengths of emission, reflective behavior, etc. must be chosen according to probability distributions.

As an example, consider the total radiative heat flux being emitted from a surface, i.e., the total emissive power,

$$
E = \int_{0}^{\infty}E_{\lambda}d\lambda = \int_{0}^{\infty}\epsilon_{\lambda}E_{b\lambda}d\lambda . \tag{8.1}
$$

Between the wavelengths of  $\lambda$  and  $\lambda +d\lambda$  the emitted heat flux is  $E_{\lambda}d\lambda = \epsilon_{\lambda}E_{b\lambda}d\lambda ,$  and the fraction of energy emitted over this wavelength range is

$$
P(\lambda)d\lambda = \frac{E_{\lambda}d\lambda}{\int_{0}^{\infty}E_{\lambda}d\lambda} = \frac{E_{\lambda}}{E} d\lambda . \tag{8.2}
$$

We may think of all the photons leaving the surface as belonging to a set of  $N$  energy bundles of equal energy (each consisting of many photons of a single wavelength). Then each bundle carries the amount of energy  $(E / N)$  with it, and the probability that any particular bundle has a wavelength between  $\lambda$  and  $\lambda +d\lambda$  is given by the probability density function  $P(\lambda)$ . The fraction of energy emitted over all wavelengths between 0 and  $\lambda$  is then

$$
R(\lambda) = \int_{0}^{\lambda}P(\lambda)d\lambda = \frac{\int_{0}^{\lambda}E_{\lambda}d\lambda}{\int_{0}^{\infty}E_{\lambda}d\lambda}. \tag{8.3}
$$

It is immediately obvious that  $R(\lambda)$  is also the probability that any given energy bundle has a wavelength between 0 and  $\lambda$ , and it is known as the cumulative distribution function. The probability that a bundle has a wavelength between 0 and  $\infty$  is, of course,  $R(\lambda \to \infty) = 1$ , a certainty. Equation (8.3) implies that if we want to simulate emission from a surface with  $N$  energy bundles of equal energy, then the fraction  $R(\lambda)$  of these bundles must have wavelengths smaller than  $\lambda$ .

Now consider a pool of random numbers equally distributed between the values 0 and 1. Since they are equally distributed, this implies that a fraction  $R$  of these random numbers have values less than  $R$  itself. Let us now pick a single random number, say  $R_0$ . Inverting equation (8.3), we find  $\lambda (R_0)$ , i.e., the wavelength corresponding to a cumulative distribution function of value  $R_0$ , and we assign this wavelength to one energy bundle. If we repeat this process many times, then the fraction  $R_0$  of all energy bundles will have wavelengths below  $\lambda (R_0)$ , since the fraction  $R_0$  of all our random numbers will be below this value. Thus, in order to model correctly the spectral variation of surface emission, using  $N$  bundles of equal energy, their wavelengths may be determined by picking  $N$  random numbers between 0 and 1, and inverting equation (8.3).

# Random Numbers

If we throw a ball onto a spinning roulette wheel, the ball will eventually settle on any one of the wheel's numbers (between 0 and 36). If we let the roulette wheel decide on another number again and again, we will obtain a set of random numbers between 0 and 36 (or between 0 and 1, if we divide each number by 36). Unless the croupier throws in the ball and spins the wheel in a regular (nonrandom) fashion, any number may be chosen each time with equal probability, regardless of what numbers have been picked previously. However, if sufficiently many numbers are picked, we may expect that roughly half (i.e., 18/37) of all the picked numbers will be between 0 and 17, for example.

![](images/90ed8a913a323007bffbf069638eb0d32e2db5b0db4c069c4ed3ebb6550d3874.jpg)  
FIGURE 8-2 Convergence of Monte Carlo method for different sets of random numbers.

During the course of a Monte Carlo simulation, generally somewhere between  $10^{5}$  and  $10^{7}$  random numbers need to be drawn, and they need to be drawn very rapidly. Obviously, spinning a roulette wheel would be impractical. One solution to this problem is to store an (externally determined) set of random numbers. However, such a table would require a prohibitive amount of computer storage, unless it were a relatively small table, that would be used repeatedly (thus destroying the true randomness of the set). The only practical answer is to generate the random numbers within the computer itself. This appears to be a contradiction, since a digital computer is the incarnation of logic (nonrandomness). Substantial research has been carried out on how to generate sets of sufficiently random numbers using what are called pseudorandom number generators. A number of such generators exist that, after making the choice of a starting point, generate a new pseudorandom number from the previous one. The randomness of such a set of numbers depends on the quality of the generator as well as the choice of the starting point and should be tested by different "randomness tests." For a more detailed discussion of pseudorandom number generators, the reader is referred to Hammersley and Handscomb [1], Schreider [8], or Taussky and Todd [16].

# Accuracy Considerations

Since Monte Carlo methods are statistical methods, the results, when plotted against number of samples, will generally fluctuate randomly around the correct answer. If a set of truly random numbers is used for the sampling, then these fluctuations will decrease as the number of samples increases. Let the answer obtained from the Monte Carlo method after tracing  $N$  energy bundles be  $S(N)$ , and the exact solution obtained after sampling infinitely many energy bundles  $S(\infty)$ . For some simple problems it is possible to calculate directly the probability that the obtained answer,  $S(N)$ , differs by less than a certain amount from the correct answer,  $S(\infty)$ .

Even if it were possible to directly calculate the confidence level for more complicated situations, this would not take into account the pseudorandomness of the computer- generated random number set. That this effect can be rather substantial is seen from Fig. 8- 2, which depicts the Monte Carlo evaluation of the view factor between two parallel black plates [17]. Both sets of data use the same computer code and the same random number generator (on a UNIVAC 1110). If a starting value of 1 is used, the results are still fairly inaccurate after 5000 bundles; if a starting value of 12,345 is used (this number gave the fastest- converging results of the ones tested for the random number generator used here), good convergence is achieved after only 4000 bundles. Obviously, careful investigation of the random number generator can increase

convergence and accuracy and thus decrease computer time considerably. Randomness tests performed on sets of generated numbers showed that a starting value of 12,345 performs well in all tests and indeed results in a "better" set of random numbers than the starting value of 1 for the random number generator employed by Modest and Poon [17].

For radiative heat transfer calculations the most straightforward way of estimating the error associated with the sampling result  $S(N)$  is to break up the result into a number of  $I$  subsamples  $S(N_{i}),$  such that

$$
\begin{array}{c}{N = N_1 + N_2 + \ldots +N_I = \sum_{i = 1}^I N_i,}\\ {S(N) = \frac{1}{N}\Big(N_1S(N_1) + \ldots +N_IS(N_I)\Big) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^I N_iS(N_i).} \end{array} \tag{8.4}
$$

Normally, each subsample would include identical amounts of bundles, leading to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{N_i = N / I;i = 1,2,\ldots ,I,}\\ {S(N) = \frac{1}{I}\sum_{i = 1}^I S(N_i).} \end{array} \tag{8.7}
$$

The  $I$  subsamples may then be treated as if they were independent experimental measurements of the same quantity. We may then calculate the variance or adjusted mean square deviation of the mean

$$
\sigma_{m}^{2} = \frac{1}{I(I - 1)}\sum_{i = 1}^{I}[S(N_{i}) - S(N)]^{2}. \tag{8.8}
$$

The central limit theorem states that the mean  $S(N)$  of  $I$  measurements  $S(N_{i})$  follows a Gaussian distribution, whatever the distribution of the individual measurements. This implies that we can say with  $68.3\%$  confidence that the correct answer  $S(\infty)$  lies within the limits of  $S(N)\pm \sigma_{m},$  with  $95.5\%$  confidence within  $S(N)\pm 2\sigma_{m},$  or with  $99\%$  confidence within  $S(N)\pm 2.58\sigma_{m}$  . Details on statistical analysis of errors may be found in any standard book on experimentation, for example, the one by Barford [18].

# 8.2 NUMERICAL QUADRATURE BY MONTE CARLO

Before discussing how statistical methods can be used to solve complicated radiative transfer problems, we will quickly demonstrate that the Monte Carlo method can also be employed to evaluate integrals numerically (known as numerical quadrature). Consider the integral  $\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx$ . The most primitive form of numerical quadrature is the trapezoidal rule, in which  $f(x)$  is assumed constant over a small interval  $\Delta x$ , i.e. [19, 20],

$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx\simeq \sum_{i = 1}^{N}f\left[x_{i} = (i - \frac{1}{2})\Delta x\right]\Delta x;\quad \Delta x = \frac{b - a}{N}. \tag{8.9}
$$

For large enough values of  $N$  equation (8.9) converges to the correct result. Note that the values of  $x_{i}$  are equally distributed across the interval between  $a$  and  $b$ . If we were to draw  $N$  random locations equally distributed between  $a$  and  $b$ , we would achieve the same result in a statistical sense. Therefore, we can evaluate any integral via the Monte Carlo method as

$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx\simeq \sum_{i = 1}^{N}f\left[x_{i} = a + (b - a)R_{i}\right]\Delta x;\Delta x = \frac{b - a}{N}, \tag{8.10}
$$

where  $R_{i}$  is a set of random numbers equally distributed between 0 and 1. Equation (8.10) is an efficient means of integration if the integrand  $f(x)$  is poorly behaved as, e.g., in the evaluation of  $k$ - distributions in Chapter 11 (integration over spectral variations of the absorption coefficient of molecular gases). However, if  $f(x)$  varies by orders of magnitude (but in a predictable manner) across  $a \leq x \leq b$ , picking equally distributed  $x_{i}$  results in putting equal emphasis on important as well as unimportant regions. The stochastic integration can be made more efficient by determining the  $x_{i}$  from a probability density function (PDF)  $p(x)$ . We may write

$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx = \int_{a}^{b}\frac{f(x)}{p(x)} p(x)dx = \int_{0}^{1}\frac{f(x(\xi))}{p(x(\xi))} d\xi \tag{8.11}
$$

where

$$
\xi (x) = \int_{a}^{x}p(x)dx,\int_{a}^{b}p(x)dx\equiv 1. \tag{8.12}
$$

The PDF is chosen in such a way that  $f / p$  remains relatively constant across  $a \leq x \leq b$ , assuring that each stochastic sample makes roughly the same contribution to the result. The integral may then be evaluated as

$$
\int_{a}^{b}f(x)dx\simeq \frac{b - a}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\frac{f(x_{i})}{p(x_{i})},\quad x_{i} = \xi^{-1}(R_{i}). \tag{8.13}
$$

Equations (8.10) and (8.13) are also useful if integration is an integral part of a Monte Carlo simulation, such as the Backward Monte Carlo scheme described at the end of this chapter. Finally, extension to two- and higher- dimensional integrals is obvious and trivial.

# 8.3 HEAT TRANSFER RELATIONS FOR RADIATIVE EXCHANGE BETWEEN SURFACES

In the absence of a participating medium and assuming a refractive index of unity, the radiative heat flux leaving or going into a certain surface, using the Monte Carlo technique, is governed by the following basic equation:

$$
q(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon (\mathbf{r})\sigma T^4 (\mathbf{r}) - \int_A\epsilon (\mathbf{r}')\sigma T^4 (\mathbf{r}')\frac{d\mathcal{F}_{dA'}\to dA}{dA} dA', \tag{8.14}
$$

where

$q(\mathbf{r}) =$  local surface heat flux at location  $\mathbf{r}$ ,  $T(\mathbf{r}) =$  surface temperature at location  $\mathbf{r}$ ,  $\epsilon (\mathbf{r}) =$  total hemispherical emittance of the surface at  $\mathbf{r}$ ,  $A =$  surface area of the enclosure, and  $d\mathcal{F}_{dA' \to dA} =$  generalized radiation exchange factor between surface elements  $dA'$  and  $dA$ .

In equation (8.14) the first term on the right- hand side describes the emission from the surface, and the integrand of the second term is the fraction of energy, originally emitted from the surface at  $\mathbf{r}'$ , which eventually gets absorbed at location  $\mathbf{r}$ . Therefore, the definition for the generalized exchange factor must be:

$d\mathcal{F}_{dA' \to dA} \equiv$  fraction of the total energy emitted by  $dA'$  that is absorbed by

This definition appears to be the most compatible one for solution by ray- tracing techniques and is therefore usually employed for calculations by the Monte Carlo method. Figure 8- 3 shows a schematic of an arbitrary enclosure with energy bundles emitted at  $dA'$  and absorbed at  $dA$ .

![](images/067d481b82946026f901add550d9b24583cd7ef2128916015ecfba28b85fb9af.jpg)  
FIGURE 8-3 Possible energy bundle paths in an arbitrary enclosure.

If the enclosure is not closed, i.e., has openings into space, some artificial closing surfaces must be introduced. For example, an opening directed into outer space without irradiation from the sun or Earth can be replaced by a black surface at a temperature of  $0\mathrm{K}$ . If the opening is irradiated by the sun, it is replaced by a nonreflecting surface with zero emittance for all angles but the solar angle, etc.

The enclosure surface is now divided into  $J$  subsurfaces, and equation (8.14) reduces to

$$
Q_{i} = \int_{A_{i}}q_{i}dA_{i} = \epsilon_{i}\sigma T_{i}^{4}A_{i} - \sum_{j = 1}^{J}\epsilon_{j}\sigma T_{j}^{4}A_{j}\mathcal{F}_{j\rightarrow i} - q_{\mathrm{ext}}A_{s}\mathcal{F}_{s\rightarrow i},\quad 1\leq i\leq J, \tag{8.16}
$$

where

$q_{\mathrm{ext}} =$  external energy entering through any opening in the enclosure,  $A_{s} =$  area of the opening irradiated from external sources, and the  $\epsilon_{j}$  and  $T_{j}$  are suitable average values for each subsurface, i.e.,

$$
\epsilon_{j}\sigma T_{j}^{4} = \frac{1}{A_{j}}\int_{A_{j}}\epsilon \sigma T^{4}dA. \tag{8.17}
$$

Although heat flow rates  $Q_{i}$  can be calculated directly by the Monte Carlo method, it is of advantage to instead determine the exchange factors: Although the  $Q_{i}$ s depend on all surface temperatures in the enclosure, the  $\mathcal{F}_{i\rightarrow j}$ 's either do not (gray surfaces) or depend only on the temperature of the emitting surface (nongray surfaces), provided that surface reflectances (and absorptances) are independent of temperature (as they are to a very good degree of accuracy). Since all emitted energy must go somewhere, and, by the Second Law of Thermodynamics the net exchange between two equal temperature surfaces must be zero, the summation rule and reciprocity also hold for exchange factors, i.e.,

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{J}\mathcal{F}_{i\rightarrow j} = 1, \tag{8.18}
$$

$$
\epsilon_{i}A_{i}\mathcal{F}_{i\rightarrow j} = \epsilon_{j}A_{j}\mathcal{F}_{j\rightarrow i}, \tag{8.19}
$$

(the former, of course, only for enclosures without openings).

A large statistical sample of energy bundles  $N_{i}$  is emitted from surface  $A_{i}$ , each of them carrying the amount of radiative energy

$$
\Delta E_{i} = \epsilon_{i}\sigma T_{i}^{4}A_{i} / N_{i}. \tag{8.20}
$$

If  $N_{ij}$  of these bundles become absorbed by surface  $A_{j}$  either after direct travel or after any number of reflections, the exchange factor may be calculated from

$$
\mathcal{F}_{i\rightarrow j} = \lim_{N_i\rightarrow \infty}\left(\frac{N_{ij}}{N_i}\right)\simeq \left(\frac{N_{ij}}{N_i}\right)_{N_i\gg 1}. \tag{8.21}
$$

MONT3D is a publicly available Fortran code [21- 24], given in Appendix F, that calculates general exchange factors for complicated three- dimensional geometries. Monte Carlo calculations of exchange factors, by their nature, automatically obey the summation rule, equation (8.18), but—due to the inherent statistical scatter—reciprocity, equation (8.19), is not fulfilled. Several smoothing schemes have been given in the literature that assure that both equations (8.18) and (8.19) are satisfied [25- 29].

# 8.4 RANDOM NUMBER RELATIONS FOR SURFACE EXCHANGE

In order to calculate the exchange factor by tracing the history of a large number of energy bundles, we need to know how to pick statistically meaningful energy bundles as explained in Section 8.1: for each emitted bundle we need to determine a point of emission, a direction of emission, and a wavelength of emission. Upon impact of the bundle onto another point of the enclosure surface, we need to decide whether the bundle is reflected and, if so, into what direction.

# Points of Emission

Similar to equation (8.1) we may write for the total emission from a surface  $A_{j}$ :

$$
E_{j} = \int_{A_{j}}\epsilon \sigma T^{4}dA. \tag{8.22}
$$

Since integration over an area is a double integral, we may rewrite this equation, without loss of generality, as

$$
E_{j} = \int_{x = 0}^{X}\int_{y = 0}^{Y}\epsilon \sigma T^{4}dydx = \int_{0}^{X}E_{j}^{\prime}dx, \tag{8.23}
$$

where

$$
E_{j}^{\prime}(x) = \int_{0}^{Y}\epsilon \sigma T^{4}dy. \tag{8.24}
$$

Thus, we may apply equation (8.3) and find

$$
R_{x} = \frac{1}{E_{j}}\int_{0}^{x}E_{j}^{\prime}dx. \tag{8.25}
$$

This relationship may be inverted to find the  $x$ - location of the emission point as a function of a random number  $R_{x}$ :

$$
x = x(R_{x}). \tag{8.26}
$$

Once the  $x$ - location has been determined, equation (8.3) may also be applied to equation (8.24), leading to an expression for the  $y$ - location of emission:

$$
R_{y} = \frac{1}{E_{j}^{\prime}(x)}\int_{0}^{y}\epsilon \sigma T^{4}dy, \tag{8.27}
$$

and

![](images/82d534ad28dc1c0a40c8ea53c266bbceb83f686372213e060a85ebb704524427.jpg)  
FIGURE 8-4 Geometry for Example 8.1.

$$
y = y(R_{y},x). \tag{8.28}
$$

Note that the choice for the  $y$ - location depends not only on the random number  $R_{y}$ , but also on the location of  $x$ .

If the emissive power may be separated in  $x$  and  $y$ , i.e., if

$$
E = \epsilon \sigma T^4 = E_x(x)E_y(y), \tag{8.29}
$$

then equation (8.25) reduces to

$$
R_{x} = \int_{0}^{x}E_{x}(x)dx\int_{0}^{x}E_{x}(x)dx, \tag{8.30}
$$

and equation (8.27) simplifies to

$$
R_{y} = \int_{0}^{y}E_{y}(y)dy\int_{0}^{Y}E_{y}(y)dy, \tag{8.31}
$$

that is, choices for  $x$ - and  $y$ - locations become independent of one another. In the simplest case of an isothermal surface with constant emittance, these relations reduce to

$$
x = R_{x}X,y = R_{y}Y. \tag{8.32}
$$

Example 8.1. Given a ring surface element on the bottom of a black isothermal cylinder with inner radius  $r_i = 10\mathrm{cm}$  and outer radius  $r_o = 20\mathrm{cm}$ , as indicated in Fig. 8- 4, calculate the location of emission for a pair of random numbers  $R_{r} = 0.5$  and  $R_{\phi} = 0.25$ .

# Solution

We find

$$
E = \int_{A}E_{b}dA = E_{b}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{r_{i}}^{r_{o}}rdrd\phi .
$$

Since this expression is separable in  $r$  and  $\phi$ , this leads to

$$
R_{\phi} = \int_{0}^{\phi}d\phi \bigg / \int_{0}^{2\pi}d\phi = \frac{\phi}{2\pi},\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \phi = 2\pi R_{\phi},
$$

and

$$
R_{r} = \int_{r_{i}}^{r}rdr\bigg / \int_{r_{i}}^{r_{o}}rdr = \frac{r^{2} - r_{i}^{2}}{r_{o}^{2} - r_{i}^{2}},
$$

or

$$
r = \sqrt{r_i^2 + (r_o^2 - r_i^2)R_r}.
$$

Therefore,  $\phi = 2\pi \times 0.25 = \pi /2$  and  $r = \sqrt{100 + (400 - 100)0.5} = 15.8\mathrm{cm}$ . While, as expected for a random number of 0.25, the emission point angle is  $90^{\circ}$  away from the  $\phi = 0$  axis, the  $r$ - location does not fall onto the midpoint. This is because the cylindrical ring has more surface area at larger radii, resulting in larger total emission. This implies that more energy bundles must be emitted from the outer part of the ring.

# Wavelengths of Emission

Once an emission location has been chosen, the wavelength of the emitted bundle needs to be determined (unless all surfaces in the enclosure are gray; in that case the wavelength of the bundle does not enter the calculations, and its determination may be omitted). The process of finding the wavelength has already been outlined in Section 8.1, leading to equation (8.3), i.e.,

$$
R_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{\epsilon\sigma T^4}\int_0^{\lambda}\epsilon_{\lambda}E_{b\lambda}d\lambda , \tag{8.33}
$$

and, after inversion,

$$
\lambda = \lambda (R_{\lambda},x,y). \tag{8.34}
$$

We note that the choice of wavelength, in general, depends on the choice for the emission location  $(x,y)$ , unless the surface is isothermal with constant emittance. If the surface is black or gray, equation (8.33) reduces to the simple case of

$$
R_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{\sigma T^4}\int_0^{\lambda}E_{b\lambda}d\lambda = f(\lambda T). \tag{8.35}
$$

# Directions of Emission

The spectral emissive power (for a given position and wavelength) is

$$
E_{\lambda} = \int_{2\pi}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}I_{b\lambda}\cos \theta d\Omega = \frac{1}{\pi} E_{b\lambda}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi /2}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\psi . \tag{8.36}
$$

As we did for choosing the (two- dimensional) point of emission, we write

$$
R_{\psi} = \frac{E_{b\lambda}}{\pi E_{\lambda}}\int_{0}^{\psi}\int_{0}^{\pi /2}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\psi = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\psi}\int_{0}^{\pi /2}\frac{\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}}{\epsilon_{\lambda}}\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\psi , \tag{8.37}
$$

or

$$
\psi = \psi (R_{\psi},x,y,\lambda). \tag{8.38}
$$

We note from equation (8.37) that  $\psi$  does not usually depend on emission location, unless the emittance changes across the surface. However,  $\psi$  does depend on the chosen wavelength, unless spectral and directional dependence of the emittance are separable. Once the azimuthal angle  $\psi$  is found, the polar angle  $\theta$  is determined from

$$
R_{\theta} = \int_{0}^{\theta}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta \int_{0}^{\pi /2}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta , \tag{8.39}
$$

or

$$
\theta = \theta (R_{\theta},x,y,\lambda ,\psi). \tag{8.40}
$$

Most surfaces tend to be isotropic so that the directional emittance does not depend on azimuthal angle  $\psi$ . In that case  $\epsilon_{\lambda} = 2\int_{0}^{\pi /2}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta$ , and equation (8.37) reduces to

$$
R_{\psi} = \frac{\psi}{2\pi},\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \psi = 2\pi R_{\psi}, \tag{8.41}
$$

and the choice of polar angle becomes independent of azimuthal angle. For a diffuse emitter, equation (8.39) simplifies to

$$
R_{\theta} = \sin^{2}\theta ,\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \theta = \sin^{-1}\sqrt{R_{\theta}}. \tag{8.42}
$$

# Order of Evaluation

In the foregoing we have chosen to first determine an emission location, followed by an emission wavelength and, finally, the direction of emission, as is most customary. However, the only constraint that we need to satisfy in a statistical manner is the total emitted energy from a surface, given by

$$
E = \int_{A}\epsilon \sigma T^{4}dA = \int_{A}\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{2\pi}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}I_{b\lambda}\cos \theta d\Omega d\lambda dA. \tag{8.43}
$$

While we have obtained the random number relationships by peeling the integrals in equation (8.43) in the order shown, integration may be carried out in arbitrary order (e.g., first evaluating emission wavelength, etc.).

# Absorption and Reflection

When radiative energy impinges on a surface, the fraction  $\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}$  will be absorbed, which may depend on the wavelength of irradiation, the direction of the incoming rays, and, perhaps, the local temperature. Of many incoming bundles the fraction  $\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}$  will therefore be absorbed while the rest,  $1 - \alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}$ , will be reflected. This can clearly be simulated by picking a random number,  $R_{\alpha}$ , and comparing it with  $\alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}$ : If  $R_{\alpha} \leq \alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}$ , the bundle is absorbed, while if  $R_{\alpha} > \alpha_{\lambda}^{\prime}$ , it is reflected.

The direction of reflection depends on the bidirectional reflection function of the material. The fraction of energy reflected into all possible directions is equal to the directional- hemispherical spectral reflectance, or

$$
\begin{array}{l}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \subset}(\lambda ,\theta_{i},\psi_{i}) = \int_{2\pi}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\lambda ,\theta_{i},\psi_{i},\theta_{r},\psi_{r})\cos \theta_{r}d\Omega_{r}\\ = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi /2}\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\lambda ,\theta_{i},\psi_{i},\theta_{r},\psi_{r})\cos \theta_{r}\sin \theta_{r}d\theta_{r}d\psi_{r}. \end{array} \tag{8.44}
$$

As before, the direction of reflection may then be determined from

$$
R_{\psi_r} = \frac{1}{\rho_\lambda^\prime\circ}\int_0^{\psi_r}\int_0^{\pi /2}\rho_\lambda^{\prime \prime}(\lambda ,\theta_i,\psi_i,\theta_r,\psi_r)\cos \theta_r\sin \theta_r d\theta_r d\psi_r, \tag{8.45}
$$

and

$$
R_{\theta_r} = \frac{\int_{0}^{\theta_r}\rho_\lambda^{\prime\prime}(\lambda,\theta_i,\psi_i,\theta_r,\psi_r)\cos\theta_r\sin\theta_rd\theta_r}{\int_0^{\pi /2}\rho_\lambda^{\prime\prime}(\lambda,\theta_i,\psi_i,\theta_r,\psi_r)\cos\theta_r\sin\theta_rd\theta_r}. \tag{8.46}
$$

If the surface is a diffuse reflector, i.e.,  $\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\lambda , \theta_{i}, \psi_{i}, \theta_{r}, \psi_{r}) = \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \prime}(\lambda) = \rho_{\lambda}^{\prime \subset}(\lambda) / \pi$ , then equations (8.45) and (8.46) reduce to

$$
R_{\psi_r} = \frac{\psi_r}{2\pi},\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \psi_r = 2\pi R_{\psi_r}, \tag{8.47}
$$

and

$$
R_{\theta_r} = \sin^2\theta_r,\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \theta_r = \sin^{-1}\sqrt{R_{\theta_r}}, \tag{8.48}
$$

FIGURE 8-5 Surface description in terms of a position vector.

which are the same as for diffuse emission. For a purely specular reflector, the reflection direction follows from the law of optics as

$$
\psi_{r} = \psi_{i} + \pi ,\quad \theta_{r} = \theta_{i}, \tag{8.49}
$$

that is, no random numbers are needed.2

# 8.5 SURFACE DESCRIPTION

When Monte Carlo simulations are applied to very simple configurations such as flat plates, e.g., Toor and Viskanta [30], the surface description, bundle intersection points, intersection angles, reflection angles, etc. are relatively obvious and straightforward. If more complicated surfaces are considered, such as the second- order polynomial description by Weiner and coworkers [31] or the arbitrary- order polynomial description by Modest and Poon [17] and Modest [32], a systematic way to describe surfaces is preferable. It appears most logical to describe surfaces in vectorial form, as indicated in Fig. 8- 5,

$$
\mathbf{r} = \sum_{i = 1}^{3}x_{i}(v_{1},v_{2})\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{i},\quad v_{1\min}\leq v_{1}\leq v_{1\max},\quad v_{2\min}(v_{1})\leq v_{2\max}(v_{1}), \tag{8.50}
$$

that is,  $\mathbf{r}$  is the vector pointing from the origin to a point on the surface,  $v_{1}$  and  $v_{2}$  are two surface parameters, the  $x_{i}$  are the  $(x,y,z)$  coordinates of the surface point, and the  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_i$  are unit vectors  $(\hat{\mathbf{r}},\hat{\mathbf{j}},\hat{\mathbf{k}})$  into the  $x,y,z$  directions, respectively. We may define two unit tangents to the surface at any point as

$$
\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1 = \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial v_1}\bigg|\bigg|\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial v_1}\bigg|,\quad \hat{\mathbf{t}}_2 = \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial v_2}\bigg|\bigg|\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial v_2}\bigg|. \tag{8.51}
$$

While it is usually a good idea to choose the surface parameters  $v_{1}$  and  $v_{2}$  perpendicular to one another (making  $\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{t}}_2$  perpendicular to each other), this is not necessary. In either case, one can evaluate the unit surface normal as

$$
\hat{\mathbf{n}} = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1\times\hat{\mathbf{t}}_2}{|\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1\times\hat{\mathbf{t}}_2|}, \tag{8.52}
$$

where it has been assumed that  $v_{1}$  and  $v_{2}$  have been ordered such that  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$  is the outward surface normal.

![](images/5880614cd4f3b25206ef1864222a3e95a5e9aff81918b9ca491b250056335ef3.jpg)  
FIGURE 8-6 Rocket nozzle diffuser geometry for Example 8.2.

# 8.6 RAY TRACING

Points of emission may be found by establishing a relationship such as equation (8.22) for the general vectorial surface description given by equation (8.50). The infinitesimal area element on the surface may be described by

$$
dA = \left|\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial v_1}\times \frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial v_2}\right|dv_1dv_2 = |\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1\times \hat{\mathbf{t}}_2|\left|\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial v_1}\right|\left|\frac{\partial\mathbf{r}}{\partial v_2}\right|dv_1dv_2. \tag{8.53}
$$

Thus, if we replace  $x$  by  $v_{1}$  and  $y$  by  $v_{2}$ , emission points  $(v_{1},v_{2})$  are readily found from equations (8.25) and (8.27).

Example 8.2. Consider the axisymmetric rocket nozzle diffuser shown in Fig. 8- 6. Assuming that the diffuser is gray and isothermal, establish the appropriate random number relationships for the determination of emission points.

# Solution

The diffuser surface is described by the formula

$$
z = a(r^{2} - r_{0}^{2}),\quad 0\leq z\leq L,\quad r_{0}\leq r\leq r_{L},\quad a = \frac{1}{2r_{0}},
$$

where  $L$  is the length of the diffuser and  $r_0$  and  $r_L$  are its radius at  $z = 0$  and  $L$ , respectively. In vectorial form, we may write

$$
\mathbf{r} = r\cos \phi \hat{\mathbf{r}} +r\sin \phi \hat{\mathbf{r}} +a(r^2 -r_0^2)\hat{\mathbf{k}},
$$

where  $\phi$  is the azimuthal angle in the  $x - y$ - plane, measured from the  $x$ - axis. This suggests the choice  $v_{1} = r$  and  $v_{2} = \phi$ . The two surface tangents are now readily calculated as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1 = \frac{\cos\phi\hat{\mathbf{r}} + \sin\phi\hat{\mathbf{r}} + 2ar\hat{\mathbf{k}}}{\sqrt{1 + 4a^2r^2}},\\ \hat{\mathbf{t}}_2 = -\sin \phi \hat{\mathbf{r}} +\cos \phi \hat{\mathbf{r}}. \end{array}
$$

It is seen that  $\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1\cdot \hat{\mathbf{t}}_2 = 0$ , i.e., the tangents are perpendicular to one another. The surface normal is then

$$
\hat{\mathbf{n}} = \hat{\mathbf{t}}_1\times \hat{\mathbf{t}}_2 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + 4a^2r^2}}\left( \begin{array}{ccc}\hat{\mathbf{t}} & \hat{\mathbf{j}} & \hat{\mathbf{k}}\\ \cos \phi & \sin \phi & 2ar\\ -\sin \phi & \cos \phi & 0 \end{array} \right) = \frac{-2ar(\cos\phi\hat{\mathbf{r}} + \sin\phi\hat{\mathbf{r}}) + \hat{\mathbf{k}}}{\sqrt{1 + 4a^2r^2}},
$$

and, finally, an infinitesimal surface area is

$$
dA = |\cos \phi \hat{\mathbf{r}} +\sin \phi \hat{\mathbf{r}} | + 2ar\hat{\mathbf{k}} || - r\sin \phi \hat{\mathbf{r}} +r\cos \phi \hat{\mathbf{r}} |drd\phi = \sqrt{1 + 4a^2r^2} rdrd\phi .
$$

FIGURE8-7 Vector description of emission direction and point of impact.

Since there is no dependence on azimuthal angle  $\phi$  in either  $dA$  or the emissive power, we find immediately

$$
R_{\phi} = \frac{\phi}{2\pi},\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \phi = 2\pi R_{\phi},
$$

and for the radial position parameter

$$
R_{r} = \frac{\int_{r_{0}}^{r}\sqrt{1 + 4a^{2}r^{2}}rdr}{\int_{r_{0}}^{r_{L}}\sqrt{1 + 4a^{2}r^{2}}rdr} = \frac{(1 + 4a^{2}r^{2})^{3 / 2}|_{r_{0}}^{r}}{(1 + 4a^{2}r_{L}^{2})^{3 / 2} - (1 + 4a^{2}r_{0}^{2})^{3 / 2}}.
$$

The above expression is readily solved to give an explicit expression for  $r = r(R_{r})$

Once a point of emission has been found, a wavelength and a direction are calculated from equations (8.33), (8.37), and (8.39). As shown in Fig. 8- 7, the direction may be specified as a unit direction vector with polar angle  $\theta$  measured from the surface normal, and azimuthal angle  $\psi$  measured from  $\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1$ , leading to

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \frac{\sin\theta}{\sin\alpha}\left[\sin (\alpha -\psi)\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1 + \sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{t}}_2\right] + \cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{n}}, \tag{8.54}
$$

and

$$
\sin \alpha = \left|\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1\times \hat{\mathbf{t}}_2\right|, \tag{8.55}
$$

where  $\alpha$  is the angle between  $\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{t}}_2$ . If  $\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{t}}_2$  are perpendicular  $(\alpha = \pi /2)$ , equation (8.54) reduces to

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \sin \theta \left[\cos \psi \hat{\mathbf{t}}_1 + \sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{t}}_2\right] + \cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{n}}. \tag{8.56}
$$

As also indicated in Fig. 8- 7, the intersection point of an energy bundle emitted at location  $\mathbf{r}_e$ , traveling into the direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , with a surface described in vectorial form may be determined as

$$
\mathbf{r}_e + D\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \mathbf{r}, \tag{8.57}
$$

where  $\mathbf{r}$  is the vector describing the intersection point, and  $D$  is the distance traveled by the energy bundle. Equation (8.57) may be written in terms of its  $x, y, z$  components and solved for

$D$  by forming the dot products with unit vectors  $\hat{\mathbf{1}}, \hat{\mathbf{j}}$ , and  $\hat{\mathbf{k}}$ :

$$
D = \frac{x(v_{1},v_{2}) - x_{e}}{\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{1}}} = \frac{y(v_{1},v_{2}) - y_{e}}{\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{j}}} = \frac{z(v_{1},v_{2}) - z_{e}}{\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{k}}}. \tag{8.58}
$$

Equation (8.58) is a set of three equations in the three unknowns  $v_{1},v_{2},$  and  $D$  : First  $v_{1}$  and  $v_{2}$  are calculated, and it is determined whether the intersection occurs within the confines of the surface under scrutiny. If so, and if more than one intersection is a possibility (in the presence of convex surfaces, protruding corners, etc.), then the path length  $D$  is also determined; if more than one intersection is found, the correct one is the one after the shortest positive path.

If the bundle is reflected, and if reflection is nonspecular, a reflection direction is chosen from equations (8.45) and (8.46). This direction is then expressed in vector form using equation (8.54). If the surface is a specular reflector, the direction of reflection is determined from equation (8.49), or in vector form as

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r = \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i + 2|\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} |\hat{\mathbf{n}}. \tag{8.59}
$$

Once the intersection point and the direction of reflection have been determined, a new intersection may be found from equation (8.58), etc., until the bundle is absorbed.

Example 8.3. Consider again the geometry of Example 8.2. An energy bundle is emitted from the origin  $(x = y = z = 0)$  into the direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} = 0.8\hat{\mathbf{i}} +0.6\hat{\mathbf{k}}$ . Determine the intersection point on the diffuser and the direction of reflection, assuming the diffuser to be a specular reflector.

# Solution

With  $r_{e} = 0$  and equations (8.50) and (8.58), we find

$$
D = \frac{r\cos\phi}{0.8} = \frac{r\sin\phi}{0} = \frac{a(r^2 - r_0^2)}{0.6}.
$$

Obviously,  $\phi = 0$ , and solving the quadratic equation for  $r$ ,

$$
r^2 -r_0^2 = \frac{3}{4}\frac{r}{a} = \frac{3}{2} rr_0,\mathrm{or}r = 2r_0\mathrm{and}z = \frac{1}{2r_0} (4r_0^2 -r_0^2) = \frac{3}{2} r_0.
$$

At that location we form the unit vectors as given in Example 8.2,

$$
\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} (\hat{\mathbf{i}} +2\hat{\mathbf{k}}),\hat{\mathbf{t}}_2 = \hat{\mathbf{j}},\mathrm{and}\hat{\mathbf{n}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} (-2\hat{\mathbf{i}} +\hat{\mathbf{k}}).
$$

Therefore, the direction of reflection is determined from equation (8.59) as

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}_r = 0.8\hat{\mathbf{i}} +0.6\hat{\mathbf{k}} +2\left|\frac{-2\times 0.8 + 0.6}{\sqrt{5}}\right|\frac{-2\hat{\mathbf{i}} + \hat{\mathbf{k}}}{\sqrt{5}} = \hat{\mathbf{k}},
$$

as is easily verified from Fig. 8- 6.

# 8.7 EFFICIENCY CONSIDERATIONS

The accuracy of results for generalized radiation exchange factors or wall heat fluxes, as characterized by the standard deviation, equation (8.8), is determined by the statistical scatter of the results. The scatter may be expected to be inversely proportional to the number of bundles absorbed by a subsurface. This number of bundles, on the other hand, is directly proportional to both total number of bundles and size of subsurface. Thus, in order to achieve good spatial resolution (small element sizes), very large numbers of bundles—often several million or even billions—must be emitted and traced. Consequently, even with the availability of today's fast digital computers, it is imperative that the Monte Carlo implementation and its ray tracings be as numerically efficient as possible, if many hours of CPU time for each computer run are to be avoided. Today's trend toward massively parallel computing brings new efficiency challenges with it that—while beyond the scope of this book—have been discussed in some detail by several investigators [15].

# Inversion of Random Number Relations

Many of the random number relationships governing emission location, wavelength, direction, etc., cannot be inverted explicitly. For example, to determine the wavelength of emission, even for a simple black surface, for a given random number  $R_{\lambda}$  requires the solution of the transcendental equation (8.33),

$$
R_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{\sigma T4}\int_{0}^{\lambda}E_{b\lambda}d\lambda = f(\lambda T). \tag{8.60}
$$

In principle, this requires guessing a  $\lambda_{r}$  calculating  $R_{\lambda},$  etc. until the correct wavelength is found; this would then be repeated for each emitted photon bundle. It would be much more efficient to invert equation (8.60) once and for all before the first energy bundle is traced as

$$
\lambda T = f^{-1}(R_{\lambda}). \tag{8.61}
$$

This is done by first calculating  $R_{\lambda ,j}$  corresponding to a  $(\lambda T)_j$  for a sufficient number of points  $j = 0,1,\ldots ,J.$  These data points may then be used to obtain a polynomial description

$$
\lambda T = A + BR_{\lambda} + CR_{\lambda}^{2} + \dots , \tag{8.62}
$$

as proposed by Howell [13]. With the math libraries available today on most digital computers it would, however, be preferable to invert equation (8.61) using a (cubic) spline.

Even more efficient is the method employed by Modest and Poon [17] and Modest [32], who used a cubic spline to determine values of  $(\lambda T)_j$  for  $(J + 1)$  equally spaced random numbers

$$
(\lambda T)_j = f^{-1}\left(R_\lambda = \frac{j}{l}\right),\quad j = 0,1,2,\ldots ,J. \tag{8.63}
$$

If, for example, a random number  $R_{\lambda} = 0.6789$  is picked, it is immediately known that  $(\lambda T)$  lies between  $(\lambda T)_m$  and  $(\lambda T)_{m + 1}$  , where  $m$  is the largest integer less than  $J\times R_{\lambda}(= 67$  if  $J = 100$  ). The actual value for  $(\lambda T)$  may then be found by (linear) interpolation.

The quantity to be determined may depend on more than a single random number. For example, to fix an emission wavelength on a surface with nonseparable emissive power (say a surface in the  $x - y$  - plane with locally varying, nongray emittance) requires the determination of

$$
x = x(R_{x}),\quad y = y(R_{y},x),\quad \lambda = \lambda (R_{\lambda},x,y). \tag{8.64}
$$

That is, first the  $x$  - location is chosen, requiring the interpolation between and storage of  $J$  data points  $x_{j}(R_{j})$  ; next the  $y$  - location is determined, requiring a double interpolation and storage of a  $J\times K$  array for  $y_{jk}(R_k,x_j)$  and finally  $\lambda$  is found from a triple interpolation from a  $J\times K\times L$  array for  $\lambda_{jkl}(R_l,x_j,y_k)$  . This may lead to excessive computer storage requirements if  $J,K,L$  are chosen too large: If  $J = K = L = 100,$  an array with one million numbers needs to be stored for the determination of emission wavelengths alone! The problem may be alleviated by choosing a better interpolation scheme together with smaller values for  $J,K,L$  (for example, a choice of  $J = K = L = 40$  reduces storage requirements to 64,000 numbers).

# Energy Partitioning

In the general Monte Carlo method, a ray of fixed energy content is traced until it is absorbed. In the absence of a participating medium, the decision whether the bundle is absorbed or reflected is made after every impact on a surface. Thus, on the average it will take  $1 / \alpha$  tracings until the bundle is absorbed. Therefore, it takes  $1 / \alpha$  tracings to add one statistical sample to the calculation of one of the  $\mathcal{F}_{i\rightarrow j}^{\prime}s$  . If the configuration has openings, a number of bundles may be reflected a few times before they escape into space without adding a statistical sample to any of the  $\mathcal{F}_{i\rightarrow j}^{\prime}s$  Thus, the ordinary Monte Carlo method becomes extremely inefficient for open configurations

and/or highly reflective surfaces. The former problem may be alleviated by partitioning the energy of emitted bundles. This was first applied by Sparrow and coworkers [33, 34], who, before determining a direction of emission, split the energy of the bundle into two parts: the part leaving the enclosure through the opening (equal to the view factor from the emission point to the opening) and the rest (which will strike a surface). A direction is then determined, limited to those that make the bundle hit an enclosure surface. The procedure is repeated after every reflection. This method guarantees that each bundle will contribute to the statistical sample for exchange factor evaluation. A somewhat more general and more easily implemented energy partitioning scheme was applied by Modest and Poon [17,32]: Rather than drawing a random number  $R_{\alpha}$  to decide whether a bundle is (fully) absorbed or not, they partition the energy of a bundle at each reflection into the fraction  $\alpha$ , which is absorbed, and the fraction  $\rho = 1 - \alpha$ , which is reflected. The bundle is then traced until it either leaves the enclosure or until its energy is depleted (below a certain fraction of original energy content). This method adds to the statistical sample of a  $\mathcal{R}_{i\rightarrow j}$  after every tracing and thus leads to vastly faster convergence for highly reflective surfaces.

# Data Smoothing

Virtually all Monte Carlo implementation to date have been of 0th order, i.e., all properties within a given cell are considered constant throughout the cell, without connectivity to surrounding cells. This makes the estimation of local gradients difficult, if not impossible. Several smoothing schemes have been proposed for the exchange factors of equation (8.21), the simpler ones without restrictions on the size of corrections [26, 27], and others that find the smallest corrections that make the exchange factors satisfy, both, the summation and reciprocity relationships [28, 29].

# Other Efficiency Improvements

Other improvements are often connected to the particular geometry under scrutiny. For instance, large amounts of computer time may be wasted because it is not immediately known, which of the many subsurfaces the traveling bundle will hit. In general, an intersection between every surface and the bundle must be calculated. Only then can it be determined whether this intersection is legitimate, i.e., whether it occurs within the bounds of the surface. Often the overall enclosure can be broken up into a (relatively small) number of basic surfaces (dictated by geometry), which in turn are broken up into a number of smaller, isothermal subsurfaces. Furthermore, a bundle emitted or reflected from some subsurface may not be able to hit some basic surface by any path. In other cases, if a possible point of impact on some surface has been determined, it may not be necessary to check the remaining surfaces, etc. There are no fixed rules for the computational structure of a Monte Carlo code. In these applications the proverbial "dash of ingenuity" can go a long way in making a computation efficient.

# Problems

Because of the nature of the Monte Carlo technique, most of the following problems require the development of a small computer code. However, all problem solutions can be outlined by giving relevant relations, equations, and a detailed flow chart.

8.5 A light pipe with direct solar irradiation is to be investigated via a Monte Carlo method. Such a device consists of a straight or curved tube covered with a highly-reflective material to pipe light into a room. At visible wavelengths the reflectance from the pipe wall is  $\rho_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\theta_{out}) = 1.5\rho_{\lambda}\cos \theta_{out}$ , with reflection angle  $\theta_{out}$  measured from the local surface normal, and visible light intensity due to direct sunshine may be approximated by

$$
L_{\lambda} = K_{\lambda}I_{\lambda ,\mathrm{sun}} = C\exp [-A^{2}(\lambda -\lambda_{0})^{2}],\lambda_{0} = 0.56\mu \mathrm{m},A = 20 / \mu \mathrm{m}.

8.6 At the Aaronsburg (Pennsylvania) Apple Fest you have won a large piece of elderberry pie (yumh!) as shown. The wheels in the oven must have been spinning, because it appears that the number of elderberries per unit area increases linearly proportional with radius! If there are 1000 elderberries otherwise randomly distributed on the slice, make a scatter plot of elderberries on the pie slice.

Develop the random number relations for points of emission; draw random numbers for 1000 emission points and draw them in a scattergram for the cases of  $C = 0$  and  $C = 5$ . Use  $R = 10\mathrm{cm}$ .

8.8 A disk of radius  $R$  is opposed by a square plate (sides of length  $R$ ) parallel to it, and a distance  $R$  away. Find the view factor from disk to square plate. Use 100,000 bundles, plotting updated results after every 5,000 bundles.

(b) Calculate  $F_{1 - 2}^{s}$  via Monte Carlo for the case that both plates are specular (with identical re-. flectances  $\rho_1^s = \rho_2^s = 0.5)$  , but not horizontally displaced. Use  $L = 0,h = w$  Prepare a figure similar to Fig. 8-2, also including analytical results for comparison.

8.10 Two directly opposed quadratic plates of width  $w = 10\mathrm{cm}$  are spaced a distance  $L = 10\mathrm{cm}$  apart, with a third centered quadratic plate of dimension  $b\times b$ $(b = 5\mathrm{cm})$  in between at a distance  $l = 5\mathrm{cm}$  from the bottom. Determine the view factor  $F_{1 - 2}$  via Monte Carlo. In order to verify your code (and to have a more flexible tool) it may be best to allow for arbitrary and different top and bottom  $w$  as well as  $b$

![](images/5f5d737558b53ff83740553fc42e7ba68b6f0201f9ba5c1ef67037fe0651f28a.jpg)

8.11 Consider two concentric parallel disks of radius  $R$ , spaced a distance  $H$  apart. Both plates are isothermal (at  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , respectively), are gray diffuse emitters with emittance  $\epsilon$ , and are gray reflectors with diffuse reflectance component  $\rho^{d}$  and purely specular component  $\rho^{s}$ . Write a computer code that calculates the generalized exchange factor  $\mathcal{F}_{1\rightarrow 2}$  and, taking advantage of the fact that  $\mathcal{F}_{1\rightarrow 2} = \mathcal{F}_{2\rightarrow 1}$ , calculate the total heat loss from each plate.

# CHAPTER 9

# SURFACE RADIATIVE EXCHANGE IN THE PRESENCE OF CONDUCTION AND CONVECTION

# 9.1 INTRODUCTION

In the previous few chapters we have considered only the analysis of radiative exchange in enclosures with specified wall temperatures or fluxes, i.e., we have neglected interaction with other modes of heat transfer. In practical systems, of course, it is nearly always the case that radiation from a boundary is affected by conduction into the solid and/or by convection from the surface. Then, two or three modes of heat transfer must be accounted for simultaneously. The interaction may be quite simple, or it may be rather involved. For example, heat loss from an isothermal surface of known temperature, adjacent to a radiatively nonparticipating medium, may occur by convection as well as radiation; however, convective and radiative heat fluxes are independent of one another, can be calculated independently, and may simply be added. If boundary conditions are more complex (i.e., surface temperatures are not specified), then radiation enters the remaining conduction/convection problem as a nonlinear boundary condition.

In a number of important applications, a conduction analysis needs to be performed on an opaque medium, which loses (or gains) heat from its surfaces by radiation (and, possibly, convection). In such cases radiation enters the conduction problem as a nonlinear boundary condition; however, the radiative flux in this boundary condition may depend on the radiative exchange in the surrounding enclosure. In other applications, conduction and/or convection in a transparent gas or liquid needs to be evaluated, bounded by opaque, radiating walls. Again, radiation enters only as a boundary condition, with the transparent medium itself occupying the enclosure governing the radiative transfer. In both types of applications radiation and conduction- convection are interdependent, i.e., a change in radiative heat flux disturbs the overall energy balance at the surface, causing a change in temperature as well as conductive- convective fluxes, and vice versa.

Many important applications of interactions between surface radiation and other modes of heat transfer have been reported in the literature. We will limit ourselves here to the discussion

![](images/83cdf9acca790c2cd58285db3955c500ec0ba5dd176e59982aac32841b5a70ae.jpg)

of a few very basic cases  $(i)$  to show the basic trends of how the different modes of heat transfer interact with one another, and  $(ii)$  to outline some of the numerical schemes that have been used to solve such problems. At the end of each section a short description of more advanced problems is given, as well as a list of references.

# 9.2 CONDUCTION AND SURFACE RADIATION-FINS

The vast majority of combined conduction- surface radiation applications involve heat transfer through vacuum, e.g., heat loss from space vehicles or vacuum insulations. As a single example we will discuss here the performance of a simple rectangular- fin radiator used to reject heat from a spacecraft.

Consider a tube with a set of radial fins, as schematically shown in Fig. 9- 1. In order to facilitate the analysis, we will make the following assumptions:

1. The thickness of each fin,  $2t,$  is much less than its length in the radial direction,  $L,$  which in turn is much less than the fin extent in the direction of the tube axis. This implies that heat conduction within the fin may be calculated by assuming that the fin temperature is a function of radial distance,  $X_{i}$  only. 
2. End losses from the fin tips (by convection and radiation) are negligible, i.e.,  $\partial T_i / \partial x_i(L)\simeq 0$  
3. The thermal conductivity of the fin material,  $k,$  is constant. 
4. The base temperatures of all fins are the same, i.e.,  $T_{1}(0) = T_{2}(0) = T_{b},$  and the fin arrangement is symmetrical, i.e.,  $T_{1}(x_{1}) = T_{2}(x_{2} = x_{1})$  , etc. 
5. The surfaces are coated with an opaque, gray, diffusely emitting and reflecting material of uniform emittance  $\epsilon$  
6. There is no external irradiation falling into the fin cavities  $(H_{o} = 0,T_{\infty} = 0)$

The first three assumptions are standard simplifications made for the analysis of thin fins (see, e.g., Holman [1]), and the other three have been made to make the radiation part of the

problem more tractable. Performing an energy balance on an infinitesimal volume element (of unit length in the axial direction)  $dV = 2t dx$ , one finds:

conduction going in at  $\mathcal{X}$  across cross- sectional area  $(2t)$ $=$  conduction going out at  $x + dx$ $^+$  net radiative loss from top and bottom surfaces  $(2dx)$

or

$$
-2tk\frac{dT}{dx}\bigg|_x = -2tk\frac{dT}{dx}\bigg|_{x + dx} + 2q_Rdx.
$$

Expanding the outgoing conduction term into a truncated Taylor series,

$$
\left.\frac{dT}{dx}\right|_{x + dx} = \left.\frac{dT}{dx}\right|_x + dx\left.\frac{d^2T}{dx^2}\right|_x + \dots ,
$$

then leads to

$$
\frac{d^2T}{dx^2} = \frac{1}{tk} q_R. \tag{9.1}
$$

Here  $q_{R}(x)$  is the net radiative heat flux leaving a surface element of the fin, which may be determined in terms of surface radiosity,  $J,$  from equations (5.24) and (5.25) as1

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q_{R}(x_{1}) = J(x_{1}) - \int_{x_{2} = 0}^{L}J(x_{2})dF_{d1 - d2},}\\ {J(x_{1}) = \epsilon \sigma T^{4}(x_{1}) + (1 - \epsilon)\int_{x_{2} = 0}^{L}J(x_{2})dF_{d1 - d2}.} \end{array} \tag{9.3}
$$

The expression for radiative heat flux may be simplified by eliminating the integral, equation (5.26),

$$
q_{R}(x_{1}) = \frac{\epsilon}{1 - \epsilon}\left[\sigma T_{1}^{4}(x_{1}) - J_{1}(x_{1})\right]. \tag{9.4}
$$

The view factor between two infinitely long strips may be found from Appendix D, Configuration 5, or from Example 4.1 as

$$
F_{d1 - d2} = \frac{x_1\sin^2\alpha x_2dx_2}{2S_0^3} = \frac{\sin^2\alpha x_1x_2dx_2}{2(x_1^2 - 2x_1x_2\cos\alpha + x_2^2)^{3 / 2}}. \tag{9.5}
$$

Equation (9.1) requires two boundary conditions, namely,

$$
T(x = 0) = T_{b},\quad \frac{dT}{dx} (x = L) = 0. \tag{9.6}
$$

Before we attempt a numerical solution, it is a good idea to summarize the mathematical problem in terms of nondimensional variables and parameters,

$$
\theta (\xi) = \frac{T(x)}{T_b},\mathcal{J}(\xi) = \frac{J(x)}{\sigma T_b^4},N_c = \frac{kt}{\sigma T_b^3L^2},\xi = \frac{x}{L}, \tag{9.7}
$$

where  $\theta$  and  $\mathcal{J}$  are nondimensional temperature and radiosity, and  $N_{c}$  is usually called the conduction- to- radiation parameter, sometimes also known as the Planck number. With these definitions,

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{d^2\theta}{d\xi^2} = \frac{1}{N_c}\frac{\epsilon}{1 - \epsilon}\left[\theta^4 (\xi) - \mathcal{J}(\xi)\right],\\ \displaystyle \mathcal{J}(\xi) = \epsilon \theta^4 (\xi) + (1 - \epsilon)\int_{\xi = 0}^{1}\mathcal{J}(\xi ')K(\xi ,\xi ')d\xi ',\\ \displaystyle K(\xi ,\xi ') = \frac{1}{2}\sin^2\alpha \frac{\xi\xi'}{(\xi^2 - 2\xi\xi'\cos\alpha + \xi'^2)^{3 / 2}}, \end{array} \tag{9.8b}
$$

subject to

$$
\theta (\xi = 0) = 1,\quad \frac{d\theta}{d\xi} (\xi = 1) = 0. \tag{9.8d}
$$

As for convection- cooled fins, a fin efficiency,  $\eta_{f},$  is defined, comparing the heat loss from the actual fin to that of an ideal fin (a black fin, which is isothermal at  $T_{b}$  ). The total heat loss from an ideal fin  $(\epsilon = 1,J = \sigma T_b^4)$  is readily determined from equation (9.2) and Appendix  $\mathbb{D},$  Configuration 34, as

$$
Q_{\mathrm{ideal}} = 2Lq_{R,\mathrm{ideal}} = 2L\sigma T_b^4 (1 - F_{1 - 2}) = 2L\sin \frac{\alpha}{2}\sigma T_b^4, \tag{9.9}
$$

while the actual heat loss follows from Fourier's law applied to the base, or by integrating over the length of the fin, as

$$
Q_{\mathrm{actual}} = -2t k\left.\frac{dT}{dx}\right|_{x = 0} = 2\int_{0}^{L}q_{R}(x)dx. \tag{9.10}
$$

Thus,

$$
\eta_{f} = \frac{Q_{\mathrm{actual}}}{Q_{\mathrm{ideal}}} = -\frac{N_{c}}{\sin\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{d\theta}{d\xi}\bigg|_{0} = \frac{1}{\sin\frac{\alpha}{2}}\frac{\epsilon}{1 - \epsilon}\int_{0}^{1}(\theta^{4} - \mathcal{J})d\xi , \tag{9.11}
$$

where the last expression is obtained by integrating equation (9.8a) along the length  $L$  of the fin.

The set of equations (9.8) is readily solved by a host of different methods, including the net radiation method [finite- differencing equation (9.8b) into finite- width isothermal strips, to which equation (5.34) can be applied] or any of the solution methods for Fredholm equations discussed in Section 5.6. Because of the nonlinear nature of the equations it is always advisable to employ the method of successive approximations, i.e., a temperature field is guessed, a radiosity distribution is calculated, an updated temperature field is determined by solving the differential equation (for a known right- hand side), etc.

Sample results for the efficiency, as obtained by Sparrow and coworkers [2], are shown in Fig. 9- 2. The variation of the fin efficiency is similar to that for a convectively cooled fin (with the heat transfer coefficient replaced by a "radiative heat transfer coefficient,"  $h_{R} = 4\epsilon \sigma T_{b}^{2}$ ). Maximum efficiency is obtained for  $N_{c} \to \infty$ , i.e., when conduction dominates and the fin is essentially isothermal. For  $\epsilon < 1$  the efficiency is limited to values  $\eta_{f} < 1$  since a black configuration will always lose more heat. It is also observed that the fin efficiency (but not the actual heat lost) increases as the opening angle  $\alpha$  decreases: For small opening angles irradiation from adjacent fins reduces the net radiative heat loss by a large fraction, but not as much as for the "ideal" fin (with irradiation from adjacent fins, which are black and at  $T_{b}$ ).

Many other studies discussing the interaction of surface radiation and one- dimensional conduction may be found in the literature. For example, Hering [3] and Tien [4] considered the fins of Fig. 9- 1 with specularly reflecting surfaces, and Sparrow and coworkers [2] investigated the influence of external irradiation. Fins connecting parallel tubes were studied by Bartas and Sellers [5], Sparrow and coworkers [6,7], and Lieblein [8]. Single annular fins (i.e., annular

![](images/2844d4675c8e24d0a67940c3b193dd1770f986b41bf0bbed42d34fbf0c4e4c42.jpg)  
FIGURE 9-2 Radiative fin efficiency for longitudinal plate fins [2].

disks attached to the outside of tubes) were studied by Chambers and Sommers [9] (rectangular cross- section), Keller and Holdredge [10] (variable cross- section), and Mackay [11] (with external irradiation), while Sparrow and colleagues [12] investigated the interaction between adjacent fins. Various other publications have appeared dealing with different geometries, surface properties (including nongrayness effects), irradiation conditions, etc. A partial listing is given with [13- 35].

More recently, some researchers have considered combined conduction- surface radiation in media with cavities, such as porous media [36, 37], packed beds of spheres [38], mirror furnaces [39], and honeycomb panels [40- 42].

# 9.3 CONVECTION AND SURFACE RADIATION

As in the case of pure convection heat transfer, it is common to distinguish between external flow and internal flow applications. If the flowing medium is air or some other relatively inert gas, the assumption of a transparent, or radiatively nonparticipating, medium is often justified. As an example we will consider here the case of a transparent gas flowing through a cylindrical tube of diameter  $D = 2R$  and length  $L$ , which is heated uniformly at a rate of  $q_{w}$  (per unit surface area). As schematically shown in Fig. 9- 3, the fluid enters the tube at  $x = 0$  with a mean, or bulk, temperature  $T_{m1}$ . Over the length of the tube the supplied heat flux  $q_{w}$  is dissipated from the inner surface by convection (to the fluid) and radiation (to the openings and to other parts of the tube wall), while the outer surface of the tube is insulated. The two open ends of the tube are exposed to radiation environments at temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , respectively. The inner surface of the tube is assumed to be gray, diffusely emitting and diffusely reflecting, with a uniform emittance  $\epsilon$ . Finally, for a simplified analysis, we will assume that the convective heat transfer coefficient,  $h$ , between tube wall and fluid is constant, independent of the radiative heat transfer, and known.

With these simplifications an energy balance on a control volume  $dV = \pi R^2 \times dx$  yields:

enthalpy flux in at  $x+$  convective flux in over  $dx =$  enthalpy flux out at  $x + dx,$

\dot{m} c_{p}T_{m}(x) + h\left[T_{w}(x) - T_{m}(x)\right]2\pi Rdx = \dot{m} c_{p}T_{m}(x + dx) = \dot{m} c_{p}\left[T_{m}(x) + \frac{dT_{m}}{dx} (x)dx\right], \tag{9.12}
$$

or

$$
\frac{dT_{m}}{dx} = \frac{2h}{\rho c_{p}u_{m}R}\left[T_{w}(x) - T_{m}(x)\right], \tag{9.13}
$$

where axial conduction has been neglected, and the mass flow rate has been expressed in terms of mean velocity as  $m = \mu u_{m} / k^{2}$ . Equation (9.13) is a single equation for the unknown wall and bulk temperatures  $T_{w}(x)$  and  $T_{m}(x)$  and is subject to the inlet condition

$$
T_{m}(x = 0) = T_{m1}. \tag{9.14}
$$

An energy balance for the tube surface states that the prescribed heat flux  $q_{w}$  is dissipated by convection and radiation or, applying equation (5.26) for the radiative heat flux,

$$
q_{w} = h\left[T_{w}(x) - T_{m}(x)\right] + \frac{\epsilon}{1 - \epsilon}\left[\sigma T_{w}^{4}(x) - J(x)\right]. \tag{9.15}
$$

The radiosity  $J(x)$  is found from equation (5.24) as

$$
J(x) = \epsilon \sigma T_w^4 (x) + (1 - \epsilon)\biggl \{\sigma T_1^4 F_{dx - 1} + \sigma T_2^4 F_{dx - 2} + \int_0^L J(x')dt'dx_{-dx'}\biggr \} , \tag{9.16}
$$

where  $F_{dx - 1}$  is the view factor from the circular strip of width  $dx$  at  $x$  to the opening at  $x = 0$ ,  $F_{dx - 2}$  is the one to the opening at  $x = L$ , and  $dt_{dx - dx'}$  is the view factor between two circular strips located at  $x$  and  $x'$ , as indicated in Fig. 9- 3. All view factors are readily determined from Appendix D, Configurations 9 and 31, and will not be repeated here. Equations (9.13), (9.15), and (9.16) are a set of three simultaneous equations in the unknown  $T_{w}(x)$ ,  $T_{m}(x)$ , and  $J(x)$ , which must be solved numerically. Before we attempt such a solution, it is best to recast the equations in nondimensional form. Defining the following variables and parameters,

$$
\begin{array}{l}\xi = \frac{x}{D},\quad \theta (\xi) = \left(\frac{\sigma T^4}{q_w}\right)^{1 / 4},\quad \mathcal{J}(\xi) = \frac{J}{q_w},\\ \displaystyle \mathrm{St} = \frac{h}{\rho c_p u_m},\quad H = \frac{h}{q_w}\left(\frac{q_w}{\sigma}\right)^{1 / 4}, \end{array} \tag{9.17b}
$$

transforms equations (9.13) through (9.16) to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\frac{d\theta_m}{d\xi} = 4\mathrm{St}[\theta_w(\xi) - \theta_m(\xi)],\quad \theta_m(\xi = 0) = \theta_{m1},}\\ {1 = H[\theta_w(\xi) - \theta_m(\xi)] + \frac{\epsilon}{1 - \epsilon} [\theta_w^4 (\xi) - \mathcal{J}(\xi)],}\\ {\mathcal{J}(\xi) = \epsilon \theta_w^4 (\xi) + (1 - \epsilon)\Bigg\{\theta_1^4 F_{d\xi -1} + \theta_2^4 F_{d\xi -2} + \int_0^{L / D}\mathcal{J}(\xi ')dF_{d\xi -d\xi '}\Bigg\} .} \end{array} \tag{9.19}
$$

Equation (9.19) becomes indeterminate for  $\epsilon = 1$ . For the case of a black tube  $\mathcal{J} = \theta_w^4$ , and equations (9.19) and (9.20) may be combined as

$$
1 = H[\theta_w(\xi) - \theta_m(\xi)] + \theta_w^4 (\xi) - \theta_1^4 F_{d\xi -1} - \theta_2^4 F_{d\xi -2} - \int_0^{L / D}\theta_w^4 (\xi ')dF_{d\xi -d\xi '}. \tag{9.21}
$$

Example 9.1. A transparent gas flows through a black tube subject to a constant heat flux. The convective heat transfer coefficient is known to be constant such that Stanton numbers and the nondimensional heat transfer coefficient are evaluated as  $\mathrm{St} = 2.5\times 10^{- 3}$  and  $H = 0.8$ . The environmental temperatures at both ends are equal to the local gas temperatures, i.e.,  $\theta_{1} = \theta_{m1}$  and  $\theta_{2} = \theta_{m2} = \theta_{m}(\xi = L / D)$ , and the nondimensional inlet temperature is given as  $\theta_{m1} = 1.5$ . Determine the (nondimensional) wall temperature variation as a function of relative tube length,  $L / D$ , using the numerical quadrature approach of Example 5.11.

# Solution

Since the tube wall is black we have only two simultaneous equations, (9.18) and (9.21), in the two unknowns  $\theta_{m}$  and  $\theta_{w}$ . However, the equations are nonlinear; therefore, an iterative procedure is necessary. For simplicity, we will adopt a simple backward finite- difference approach for the solution of equation (9.18), and the numerical quadrature scheme of equation (5.52) for the integral in equation (9.21). Evaluating temperatures at  $N + 1$  nodal points  $\xi_{i} = i\Delta \xi (i = 0,1,\ldots ,N)$  where  $\Delta \xi = L / (ND)$ , this implies

$$
\left(\frac{d\theta_m}{d\xi}\right)_{\xi_i}\simeq \frac{\theta_m(\xi_i) - \theta_m(\xi_{i - 1})}{\Delta\xi},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N,
$$

$$
\int_0^{L / D}\theta_w^4 (\xi ')\frac{dF_{d\xi - d\xi'}}{d\xi'} d\xi '\simeq \frac{L}{D}\sum_{j = 0}^{N}c_j\theta_w^4 (\xi_j)K(\xi_i,\xi_j),\quad i = 0,1,\ldots ,N,
$$

where the  $c_{j}$  are quadrature weights and, from Configuration 9 in Appendix D,2

$$
K(\xi_{i},\xi_{j}) = 1 - \frac{X_{ij}(2X_{ij}^{2} + 3)}{2(X_{ij}^{2} + 1)};X_{ij} = |\xi_{i} - \xi_{j}|.
$$

Similarly, the two view factors to the openings are evaluated from Configuration 31 in Appendix D as

$$
F_{d\xi_{i} - k} = \frac{X_{ij}^2 + \frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{X_{ij}^2 + 1}} -X_{ij},
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{j=0}&{\mathrm{if}\quad k=1\quad(\mathrm{open}\mathrm{ing}\mathrm{at}\xi=\xi_0=0),}\\{j=N}&{\mathrm{if}\quad k=2\quad(\mathrm{open}\mathrm{ing}\mathrm{at}\xi=\xi_N=L/D).}\end{array}
$$

To solve for the unknown  $\theta_{m}(\xi_{i})$  and  $\theta_{w}(\xi_{i})$ , we adopt the following iterative procedure:

1. A wall temperature is guessed for all wall nodes, say,

$$
\theta_{w}(\xi_{i}) = \theta_{1},\quad i = 0,1,\ldots ,N.
$$

![](images/eb2ae3385f058339133dcb3c9920c7eb34b87fe78ab3e5e74bb3fc0b5b8a161e.jpg)  
FIGURE 9-4  Axial surface temperature development for combined convection and surface radiation in a black tube subjected to constant wall heat flux.

2. A temperature difference is calculated from equation (9.21), i.e.,

$$
\phi_{i} = H[\theta_{w}(\xi_{i}) - \theta_{m}(\xi_{i})] = 1 - \theta_{w}^{4}(\xi_{i}) + \theta_{1}^{4}F_{d\xi_{i} - 1} + \theta_{2}^{4}F_{d\xi_{i} - 2} + \frac{L}{D}\sum_{i = 0}^{N}c_{j}\theta_{w}^{4}(\xi_{j})K(\xi_{i},\xi_{j}).
$$

3. The gas bulk temperature is calculated from equation (9.18) as

$$
\theta_{m}(\xi_{i}) = \theta_{m}(\xi_{i - 1}) + \frac{4\mathrm{St}\Delta\xi}{H}\phi_{i};\quad \theta_{m}(\xi_{0}) = \theta_{1},
$$

4. An updated value for the wall temperatures is then determined from the definition for  $\phi_{i}$ , that is,

$$
\theta_{w}^{\mathrm{new}}(\xi_{i}) = \omega \left[\theta_{m}(\xi_{i}) + \frac{1}{H}\phi_{i}\right] + (1 - \omega)\theta_{w}^{\mathrm{old}}(\xi_{i}),
$$

where  $\omega$  is known as the relaxation parameter. The iteration scheme is called underrelaxed if  $\omega < 1$ , and overrelaxed if  $\omega > 1$ . If  $\omega$  is chosen too large, the iteration will become unstable and not converge at all. A good or optimal value for the relaxation parameter must usually be found by trial and error. Detailed discussions on relaxation may be found in standard numerical analysis texts such as [44,45]. Some representative results are shown in Fig. 9- 4 for several values of  $L / D$ . Because of the strong nonlinearity of the problem, and the crude numerical scheme employed here, large numbers of nodes are necessary to achieve good accuracy  $(N \simeq 40L / D)$ , together with strong underrelaxation  $(\omega < 0.02)$ .

For the case of pure convection  $(\epsilon = 0$ , or  $\phi_{i} \equiv 1)$  the tube wall temperature rises linearly with axial distance, since constant wall heat flux implies a linear increase in bulk temperature and, therefore, (assuming a constant heat transfer coefficient) in surface temperature. This is not the case if radiation is present, in particular for short tubes (small  $L / D$ ). Near both ends of the tube, much of the radiative energy leaves through the openings, causing a distinct drop in surface temperature. For long tubes  $(L / D > 50)$  the surface temperature rises almost linearly over the central parts of the tube, although the temperature stays below the convection- only case: Due to the higher temperatures downstream, some net radiative heat flux travels upstream, making overall heat transfer a little more efficient. It should be noted here that the assumption of a constant heat transfer coefficient is not particularly realistic, since it implies a fully developed thermal profile. It is well known that for pure convection  $h \to \infty$  at the inlet and, thus,  $\theta_{w}(\xi = 0) = 1$  [1]. Near the inlet of a tube the actual temperature distribution for pure convection is very similar to the one depicted in Fig. 9- 3, which is driven by radiation losses. Although for pure convection a fully developed thermal profile and constant  $h$  are eventually reached

(at  $L / D > 20$  for turbulent flow), in the presence of radiation a constant heat transfer coefficient is never reached (because the radiation term makes the governing equations nonlinear).

A number of researchers have investigated combined convection and radiation for a transparent flowing medium. Flow through circular tubes was considered by Siegel and coworkers [46- 48] for a number of situations, but always assuming a constant and known heat transfer coefficient. Dussan and Irvine [49] and Chen [50] calculated the local convection rate by solving the two- dimensional energy equation for the flowing medium, but they made severe simplifications in the evaluation of radiative heat fluxes. The most general tube flow analysis has been carried out by Thorsen and Karchanagom [51,52]. Similar problems for parallel- plate channel flow were investigated by Keshock and Siegel [53] (for a constant heat transfer coefficient) and Lin and Thorsen [54] (for two- dimensional convection calculations). Combined radiation and forced convection of external flow across a flat plate has been addressed by Cess [55,56], Sparrow and Lin [57], and Sohal and Howell [58]. Fluidized bed heat transfer has also been investigated by a number of researchers [59- 61] and, finally, the interaction between surface radiation and free convection has been studied, both numerically and experimentally [62- 71].

The antenna is a specular reflector with  $\epsilon_{a} = 0.1$ ,  $k_{a} = 100\mathrm{W / mK}$ , and  $d = 1\mathrm{cm}$ . Satellite and antenna are exposed to solar radiation of strength  $q_{\mathrm{sol}} = 1300\mathrm{W / m}^2$  from a direction normal to the antenna. Assuming that the satellite produces heat at a rate of  $4\mathrm{kW}$  and due to a high- conductivity shell- is essentially isothermal, determine the equilibrium temperature distribution along the antenna. (Hint: Use the fact that  $d\ll R$  not only for conduction calculations, but also for the calculation of view factors.)

9.2 A long, thin, cylindrical needle  $(L\gg D)$  is attached perpendicularly to a large, isothermal base plate at  $T = T_{b} = \mathrm{const}$ . The base plate is gray and diffuse  $(\epsilon_{b} = \alpha_{b})$ , while the needle is nongray and diffuse  $(\epsilon \neq \alpha)$ . The needle exchanges heat by convection and radiation with a large, isothermal environment at  $T_{\infty}$ .

(a) Neglecting heat losses from the free tip of the needle, formulate the problem for the calculation of needle temperature distribution, total heat loss, and fin efficiency. 
(b) Implement the solution numerically for  $L = 1\mathrm{m},D = 1\mathrm{cm},k = 10\mathrm{W / mK},h = 40\mathrm{W / m^2K},$ $\epsilon = 0.8,\alpha = 0.4,\epsilon_{b} = 0.8,T_{b} = 1000\mathrm{K},T_{\infty} = 300\mathrm{K}.$

9.3 In the emissometer of Vader and coworkers [72] and Sikka [73], the sample is kept inside a long silicon carbide tube that in turn, is inside a furnace, as shown in the sketch. The furnace is heated with a number of SiC heating elements, providing a uniform flux over a  $45\mathrm{cm}$  length as shown. Assume that there is no heat loss through the refractory brick or the bottom of the furnace, that the inside heat transfer coefficient for free convection (with air at  $600^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ) is  $10\mathrm{W / m^2K}$ , that the silicon carbide tube is gray- diffuse ( $\epsilon = 0.9$ ,  $k = 100\mathrm{W / mK}$ ), and that the sample temperature is equal to the SiC tube temperature at the same height. What must be the steady- state power load on the furnace to maintain a sample temperature of  $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ? In this configuration a detector receiving radiation from a small center spot of the sample is supposedly getting the same amount as from a blackbody at  $1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  (cf. Table 5.1). What is the actual emittance sensed by the detector, i.e., what systematic error is caused by this near- blackbody, if the sample is gray and diffuse with  $\epsilon_{s} = 0.5$ ?

9.4 A thermocouple with a  $0.5\mathrm{mm}$  diameter bead is used to measure the local temperature of a hot, radiatively nonparticipating gas flowing through an isothermal, gray- diffuse tube ( $T_{w} = 300\mathrm{K}$ ,  $\epsilon_{w} = 0.8$ ). The thermocouple is a diffuse emitter/specular reflector with  $\epsilon_{b} = 0.5$ , and the heat transfer coefficient between bead and gas is  $30\mathrm{W / m^2K}$ .

(a) Determine the thermocouple error as a function of gas temperature (i.e.,  $|T_{b} - T_{g}|$  vs.  $T_{g}$ ). 
(b) In order to reduce the error, a radiation shield in the form of a thin, stainless-steel cylinder ( $\epsilon = 0.1$ ,  $R = 2\mathrm{mm}$ ,  $L = 20\mathrm{mm}$ ) is placed over the thermocouple. This also reduces the heat transfer coefficient between bead and gas to  $15\mathrm{W / m^2K}$ , which is equal to the heat transfer coefficient on the inside of the shield. On the outside of the cylinder the heat transfer coefficient is  $30\mathrm{W / m^2K}$ . Determine error vs. gas temperature for this case.

To simplify the problem, you may make the following assumptions: (i) the leads of the thermocouple may be neglected, (ii) the shield is very long as far as the radiation analysis is concerned, and (iii) the shield reflects diffusely.

9.5 Repeat Problem 5.36 for the case in which a radiatively nonparticipating, stationary gas ( $k = 0.04\mathrm{W / mK}$ ) is filling the 1 cm thick gap between surface and shield.

# CHAPTER 10

# THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER EQUATION IN PARTICIPATING MEDIA (RTE)

# 10.1 INTRODUCTION

In previous chapters we have looked at radiative transfer between surfaces that were separated by vacuum or by a transparent ("radiatively nonparticipating") medium. However, in many engineering applications the interaction of thermal radiation with an absorbing, emitting, and scattering ("radiatively participating") medium must be accounted for. Examples in the heat transfer area are the burning of any fuel (be it gaseous, liquid, or solid; be it for power production, within fires, within explosions, etc.), rocket propulsion, hypersonic shock layers, ablation systems on reentry vehicles, nuclear explosions, plasmas in fusion reactors, and many more.

In the present chapter we shall develop the general relationships that govern the behavior of radiative heat transfer in the presence of an absorbing, emitting, and/or scattering medium. We shall begin by making a radiative energy balance, known as the radiative transfer equation, or RTE, which describes the radiative intensity field within the enclosure as a function of location (fixed by location vector  $\mathbf{r}$ ), direction (fixed by unit direction vector  $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ ) and spectral variable (wavenumber  $\eta$ ).<sup>1</sup> To obtain the net radiative heat flux crossing a surface element, we must sum the contributions of radiative energy irradiating the surface from all possible directions and for all possible wavenumbers. Therefore, integrating the radiative transfer equation over all directions and wavenumbers leads to a conservation of radiative energy statement applied to an infinitesimal volume. Finally, this will be combined with a balance for all types of energy (including conduction and convection), leading to the Overall Conservation of Energy equation.

In the following three chapters we shall deal with the radiation properties of participating media, i.e., with how a substance can absorb, emit, and scatter thermal radiation. In Chapter 11 we discuss how a molecular gas can absorb and emit photons by changing its energy states, how to predict the radiation properties, and how to measure them experimentally. Chapter 12 is concerned with how small particles interact with electromagnetic waves- - how they absorb,

![](images/bc211301f4a2958b3979d4a89ce7fe8053ed64cad0d5f87f09ee2f7ce6f54e1c.jpg)  
FIGURE 10-1 Attenuation of radiative intensity by absorption and scattering.

emit, and scatter radiative energy. Again, theoretical as well as experimental methods are covered. Finally, in Chapter 13 a very brief account is given of the radiation properties of solids and liquids that allow electromagnetic waves of certain wavelengths to penetrate into them for appreciable distances, known as semitransparent media.

# 10.2 ATTENUATION BY ABSORPTION AND SCATTERING

If the medium through which radiative energy travels is "participating," then any incident beam will be attenuated by absorption and scattering while it travels through the medium, as schematically shown in Fig. 10- 1. In the following we shall develop expressions for this attenuation for a light beam which travels within a pencil of rays into the direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ . The present discussion will be limited to media with constant refractive index, i.e., media through which electromagnetic waves travel along straight lines [while a varying refractive index will bend the ray, as shown by Snell's law, equation (2.72), for an abrupt change]. It is further assumed that the medium is stationary (as compared to the speed of light), that it is nonpolarizing, and that it is (for most of the discussion) at local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE).

# Absorption

The absolute amount of absorption has been observed to be directly proportional to the magnitude of the incident energy as well as the distance the beam travels through the medium. Thus, we may write,

$$
(dI_{\eta})_{\mathrm{abs}} = -\kappa_{\eta}I_{\eta}ds, \tag{10.1}
$$

where the proportionality constant  $\kappa_{\eta}$  is known as the (linear) absorption coefficient, and the negative sign has been introduced since the intensity decreases. As will be discussed in the following chapter, the absorption of radiation in molecular gases depends also on the number of receptive molecules per unit volume, so that some researchers use a mass absorption coefficient or a pressure absorption coefficient, defined by

$$
(dI_{\eta})_{\mathrm{abs}} = -\kappa_{\rho \eta}I_{\eta}\rho ds = -\kappa_{\rho \eta}I_{\eta}pd s. \tag{10.2}
$$

The subscripts  $\rho$  and  $p$  are used here only to demonstrate the differences between the coefficients. The reader of scientific literature often must rely on the physical units to determine the coefficient used.

Integration of equation (10.1) over a geometric path  $s$  results in

$$
I_{\eta}(s) = I_{\eta}(0)\exp \left(-\int_{0}^{s}\kappa_{\eta}ds\right) = I_{\eta}(0)e^{-\tau_{\eta}}, \tag{10.3}
$$

where

$$
\tau_{\eta} = \int_{0}^{s}\kappa_{\eta}ds \tag{10.4}
$$

is the optical thickness (for absorption) through which the beam has traveled and  $I_{\eta}(0)$  is the intensity entering the medium at  $s = 0$ . Note that the (linear) absorption coefficient is the inverse of the mean free path for a photon until it undergoes absorption. One may also define an absorptivity for the participating medium (for a given path within the medium) as

$$
\alpha_{\eta}\equiv \frac{I_{\eta}(0) - I_{\eta}(s)}{I_{\eta}(0)} = 1 - e^{-\tau_{\eta}}. \tag{10.5}
$$

# Scattering

Attenuation by scattering, or "out- scattering" (away from the direction under consideration), is very similar to absorption, i.e., a part of the incoming intensity is removed from the direction of propagation,  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ . The only difference between the two phenomena is that absorbed energy is converted into internal energy, while scattered energy is simply redirected and appears as augmentation along another direction (discussed in the next section), also known as "incattering." Thus, we may write

$$
(dI_{\eta})_{\mathrm{sca}} = -\sigma_{s\eta}I_{\eta}ds, \tag{10.6}
$$

where the proportionality constant  $\sigma_{s\eta}$  is the (linear) scattering coefficient for scattering from the pencil of rays under consideration into all other directions. Again, scattering coefficients based on density or pressure may be defined. It is also possible to define an optical thickness for scattering, where the scattering coefficient is the inverse of the mean free path for scattering.

# Total Attenuation

The total attenuation of the intensity in a pencil of rays by both absorption and scattering is known as extinction. Thus, an extinction coefficient is defined as

$$
\beta_{\eta} = \kappa_{\eta} + \sigma_{s\eta}. \tag{10.7}
$$

The optical distance based on extinction is defined as

$$
\tau_{\eta} = \int_{0}^{s}\beta_{\eta}ds. \tag{10.8}
$$

As for absorption and scattering, the extinction coefficient is sometimes based on density or pressure.

# 10.3 AUGMENTATION BY EMISSION AND SCATTERING

A light beam traveling through a participating medium in the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  loses energy by absorption and by scattering away from the direction of travel. But at the same time it also gains energy by emission, as well as by scattering from other directions into the direction of travel  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ .

![](images/372c376a494ec344596b54d2eac8da99d1b638def292c45a1a24b285cc186121.jpg)  
FIGURE 10-2 Reduction of radiative intensity by scattering.

# Emission

The rate of emission from a volume element will be proportional to the magnitude of the volume. Therefore, the emitted intensity (which is the rate of emitted energy per unit area) along any path again must be proportional to the length of the path, and it must be proportional to the local energy content in the medium. Thus,

$$
(dI_{\eta})_{\mathrm{em}} = j_{\eta}ds, \tag{10.9}
$$

where  $j_{\eta}$  is termed the emission coefficient. Since, at local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), the intensity everywhere must be equal to the blackbody intensity, it will be shown in Chapter 11, equation (11.22), that

$$
j_{\eta} = \kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta}\quad \mathrm{and}\quad (dI_{\eta})_{\mathrm{em}} = \kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta}ds, \tag{10.10}
$$

that is, at LTE the proportionality constant for emission is the same as for absorption. Similar to absorptivity, one may also define an emissivity of an isothermal medium as the amount of energy emitted over a certain path  $s$  that escapes into a given direction (without having been absorbed between point of emission and point of exit), as compared to the maximum possible. Combining equations (10.1) and (10.10) gives the complete radiative transfer equation for an absorbing- emitting (but not scattering) medium as

$$
\frac{dI_{\eta}}{ds} = \kappa_{\eta}(I_{b\eta} - I_{\eta}), \tag{10.11}
$$

where the first term of the right- hand side is augmentation due to emission and the second term is attenuation due to absorption. The solution to the radiative transfer equation for an isothermal gas layer of thickness  $s$  is

$$
I_{\eta}(s) = I_{\eta}(0)e^{-\tau_{\eta}} + I_{b\eta}\left(1 - e^{-\tau_{\eta}}\right), \tag{10.12}
$$

where the optical distance has been defined in equation (10.4). If only emission is considered,  $I_{\eta}(0) = 0$ , and the emissivity is defined as

$$
\epsilon_{\eta} = I_{\eta}(s) / I_{b\eta} = 1 - e^{-\tau_{\eta}}, \tag{10.13}
$$

which, as is the case with surface radiation, is identical to the expression for absorptivity.

# Scattering

Augmentation due to scattering, or "in- scattering," has contributions from all directions and, therefore, must be calculated by integration over all solid angles. Consider the radiative heat flux impinging on a volume element  $dV = dA ds$ , from an infinitesimal pencil of rays in the direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  as depicted in Fig. 10- 2. Recalling the definition for radiative intensity as energy flux per unit area normal to the rays, per unit solid angle, and per unit wavenumber interval,

![](images/5d6c76a9c86a7d72c4d9bff22ee415e5a9c780e96aaade0b18f25bccab36885b.jpg)  
FIGURE 10-3 Pencil of rays for radiative energy balance.

one may calculate the spectral radiative heat flux impinging on  $dA$  from within the solid angle  $d\Omega_{i}$  as

$$
I_{\eta}(\pmb {\mathfrak{s}}_i)(dA\pmb {\mathfrak{s}}_i\cdot \pmb {\mathfrak{s}})d\Omega_i d\eta .
$$

This flux travels through  $dV$  for a distance  $ds / \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}$ . Therefore, the total amount of energy scattered away from  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  is, according to equation (10.6),

$$
\sigma_{s\eta}\Big(I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)(dA\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega_id\eta \Big)\left(\frac{ds}{\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}}}\right) = \sigma_{s\eta}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)dAd\Omega_id\eta ds. \tag{10.14}
$$

Of this amount, the fraction  $\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega /4\pi$  is scattered into the cone  $d\Omega$  around the direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ . The function  $\Phi_{\eta}$  is called the scattering phase function and describes the probability that a ray from one direction,  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$ , will be scattered into a certain other direction,  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ . The constant  $4\pi$  is arbitrary and is included for convenience [see equation (10.17) below].

The amount of energy flux from the cone  $d\Omega_{i}$  scattered into the cone  $d\Omega$  is then

$$
\sigma_{s\eta}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)dAd\Omega_id\eta ds\frac{\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}})}{4\pi} d\Omega . \tag{10.15}
$$

We can now calculate the energy flux scattered into the direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  from all incoming directions  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  by integrating:

$$
\left(dI_{\eta}\right)_{\mathrm{sca}}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})dAd\Omega d\eta = \int_{4\pi}\sigma_{s\eta}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)dAd\Omega_i d\eta ds\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}})\frac{d\Omega}{4\pi},
$$

or

$$
\left(dI_{\eta}\right)_{\mathrm{sca}}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = ds\frac{\sigma_{s\eta}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega_i. \tag{10.16}
$$

Returning to equation (10.15), we find that the amount of energy flux scattered from  $d\Omega_{i}$  into all directions is

$$
\sigma_{s\eta}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)dAd\Omega_id\eta ds\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega ,
$$

which must be equal to the amount in equation (10.14). We conclude that

$$
\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega \equiv 1. \tag{10.17}
$$

Therefore, if  $\Phi_{\eta} =$  const, i.e., if equal amounts of energy are scattered into all directions (called isotropic scattering), then  $\Phi_{\eta} \equiv 1$ . This is the reason for the inclusion of the factor  $4\pi$ .

# 10.4 THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER EQUATION

We can now make an energy balance on the radiative energy traveling in the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  within a small pencil of rays as shown in Fig. 10- 3. The change in intensity is found by summing the contributions from emission, absorption, scattering away from the direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , and scattering into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , from equations (10.1), (10.6), (10.9), and (10.16) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I_{\eta}(s + ds,\hat{\mathbf{s}},t + dt) - I_{\eta}(s,\hat{\mathbf{s}},t) = j_{\eta}(s,t)ds - \kappa_{\eta}I_{\eta}(s,\hat{\mathbf{s}},t)ds}\\ {-\sigma_{s\eta}I_{\eta}(s,\hat{\mathbf{s}},t)ds + \frac{\sigma_{s\eta}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega_ids.} \end{array} \tag{10.18}
$$

![](images/75957055722a8bc2bcd2e5d6b568f248792dbe8e3aeed4530346701b1e868bbc.jpg)  
FIGURE 10-4Enclosure for derivation of radiative transfer equation.

This equation is Lagrangian in nature, i.e., we are following a ray from  $s$  to  $s + ds$ ; since the ray travels at the speed of light  $c$ ,  $ds$  and  $dt$  are related through  $ds = c dt$ . The outgoing intensity may be developed into a truncated Taylor series, or

$$
I_{\eta}(s + ds,\pmb {\hat{s}},t + dt) = I_{\eta}(s,\pmb {\hat{s}},t) + dt\frac{\partial I_{\eta}}{\partial t} +ds\frac{\partial I_{\eta}}{\partial s}, \tag{10.19}
$$

so that equation (10.18) may be simplified to

$$
\frac{1}{c}\frac{\partial I_{\eta}}{\partial t} +\frac{\partial I_{\eta}}{\partial s} = j_{\eta} - \kappa_{\eta}I_{\eta} - \sigma_{s\eta}I_{\eta} + \frac{\sigma_{s\eta}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\pmb{\hat{s}}_i)\Phi_{\eta}(\pmb{\hat{s}}_i,\pmb {\hat{s}})d\Omega_i. \tag{10.20}
$$

In this radiative transfer equation (commonly abbreviated as RTE), or equation of transfer, all quantities may vary with location in space, time, and wavenumber, while the intensity and the phase function also depend on direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  (and  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$ ). Only the directional dependence, and only whenever necessary, has been explicitly indicated in this and the following equations, to simplify notation. As indicated earlier, the development of this equation is subject to a number of simplifying assumptions, viz., the medium is homogeneous and at rest (as compared to the speed of light), the medium is nonpolarizing and the state of polarization is neglected, and the medium has a constant index of refraction. An elaborate discussion of these limitations has been given by Viskanta and Menguc [1]. The RTE for a medium with varying refractive index has been given, e.g., by Pomraning [2], and some recent developments have been reported by Ben- Abdallah [3].

Equation (10.20) is valid anywhere inside an arbitrary enclosure. Its solution requires knowledge of the intensity for each direction at some location  $s$ , usually the intensity entering the medium through or from the enclosure boundary into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , as indicated in Fig. 10- 4. We have not yet brought the radiative transfer equation into its most compact form so that the four different contributions to the change of intensity may be clearly identified. Equation (10.20) is the transient form of the radiative transfer equation, valid at local thermodynamic equilibrium as well as nonequilibrium.

Over the last few years, primarily due to the development of short- pulsed lasers, with pulse durations in the ps or fs range, transient radiation phenomena have been becoming of increasing importance [4]. However, for the vast majority of engineering applications, the speed of light is so large compared to local time and length scales that the first term in equation (10.20) may

be neglected. There are also several important applications that take place at thermodynamic nonequilibrium, such as the strong nonequilibrium radiation hitting a hypersonic spacecraft entering Earth's atmosphere [5] (creating a high- temperature plasma ahead of it; cf. Fig. 11- 7). Nevertheless, most engineering applications are at local thermodynamic equilibrium. We have presented here the full equation for completeness, but will omit the transient and nonequilibrium terms during the remainder of this book (with the exception of a very brief discussion of nonequilibrium properties in Chapter 11, and a somewhat more detailed consideration of transient radiation in Chapter 19).

After introducing the extinction coefficient defined in equation (10.7), one may restate equation (10.20) in its equilibrium, quasi- steady form as

$$
\frac{dI_{\eta}}{ds} = \hat{\mathbf{q}}\cdot \nabla I_{\eta} = \kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta} - \beta_{\eta}I_{\eta} + \frac{\sigma_{s\eta}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)d\Omega_i, \tag{10.21}
$$

where the intensity gradient has been converted into a total derivative since we assume the process to be quasi- steady. The radiative transfer equation is often rewritten in terms of nondimensional optical coordinates (see Fig. 10- 4),

$$
\tau_{\eta} = \int_{0}^{s}(\kappa_{\eta} + \sigma_{s\eta})ds = \int_{0}^{s}\beta_{\eta}ds, \tag{10.22}
$$

and the single scattering albedo, first defined in equation (1.58) as

$$
\omega_{\eta}\equiv \frac{\sigma_{s\eta}}{\kappa_{\eta} + \sigma_{s\eta}} = \frac{\sigma_{s\eta}}{\beta_{\eta}}, \tag{10.23}
$$

leading to

$$
\frac{dI_{\eta}}{d\tau_{\eta}} = -I_{\eta} + (1 - \omega_{\eta})I_{b\eta} + \frac{\omega_{\eta}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)d\Omega_i. \tag{10.24}
$$

The last two terms in equation (10.24) are often combined and are then known as the source function for radiative intensity,

$$
S_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = (1 - \omega_{\eta})I_{b\eta} + \frac{\omega_{\eta}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)d\Omega_i. \tag{10.25}
$$

Equation (10.24) then assumes the deceptively simple form of

$$
\frac{dI_{\eta}}{d\tau_{\eta}} +I_{\eta} = S_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta},\hat{\mathbf{s}}), \tag{10.26}
$$

which is, of course, an integro- differential equation (in space, and in two directional coordinates with local origin). Furthermore, the Planck function  $I_{b\eta}$  is generally not known and must be found by considering the overall energy equation (adding derivatives in the three space coordinates and integrations over two more directional coordinates and the wavenumber spectrum).

# 10.5 FORMAL SOLUTION TO THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER EQUATION

If the source function is known (or assumed known), equation (10.26) can be formally integrated by the use of an integrating factor. Thus, multiplying through by  $e^{\tau_{\eta}}$  results in

$$
\frac{d}{d\tau_{\eta}}\left(I_{\eta}e^{\tau_{\eta}}\right) = S_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta},\hat{\mathbf{s}})e^{\tau_{\eta}}, \tag{10.27}
$$

![](images/3cf2fa6b335ae05dba57bafc531790c323b6c66122e33ed2f9543286ccf6eb7f.jpg)  
FIGURE 10-5 Isothermal sphere for Example 10.1.

which may be integrated from a point  $s' = 0$  at the wall to a point  $s' = s$  inside the medium (see Fig. 10- 4), so that

$$
I_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta}) = I_{\eta}(0)e^{-\tau_{\eta}} + \int_{0}^{\tau_{\eta}}S_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta^{\prime}}^{\prime}\hat{\mathbf{s}})e^{-(\tau_{\eta} - \tau_{\eta^{\prime}}^{\prime})}d\tau_{\eta^{\prime}}^{\prime} \tag{10.28}
$$

where  $\tau_{\eta}^{\prime}$  is the optical coordinate at  $s = s^{\prime}$

Physically, one can readily appreciate that the first term on the right- hand side of equation (10.28) is the contribution to the local intensity by the intensity entering the enclosure at  $s = 0$ , which decays exponentially due to extinction over the optical distance  $\tau_{\eta}$ . The integrand of the second term,  $S_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta}^{\prime}) d \tau_{\eta}^{\prime}$ , on the other hand, is the contribution from the local emission at  $\tau_{\eta}^{\prime}$ , attenuated exponentially by self- extinction over the optical distance between the emission point and the point under consideration,  $\tau_{\eta} - \tau_{\eta}^{\prime}$ . The integral, finally, sums all the contributions over the entire emission path.

Equation (10.28) is a third- order integral equation in intensity  $I_{\eta}$ . The integral over the source function must be carried out over the optical coordinate (for all directions), while the source function itself is also an integral over a set of direction coordinates (with varying local origin) containing the unknown intensity. Furthermore, usually the temperature and, therefore, the blackbody intensity are not known and must be found in conjunction with overall conservation of energy. There are, however, a few cases for which the radiative transfer equation becomes considerably simplified.

# Nonscattering Medium

If the medium only absorbs and emits, the source function reduces to the local blackbody intensity, and

$$
I_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta}) = I_{\eta}(0)e^{-\tau_{\eta}} + \int_{0}^{\tau_{\eta}}I_{b_{\eta}}(\tau_{\eta}^{\prime})e^{-(\tau_{\eta} - \tau_{\eta}^{\prime})}d\tau_{\eta}^{\prime} \tag{10.29}
$$

This equation is an explicit expression for the radiation intensity if the temperature field is known. However, generally the temperature is not known and must be found in conjunction with overall conservation of energy.

Example 10.1. What is the spectral intensity emanating from an isothermal sphere bounded by vacuum or a cold black wall?

# Solution

Because of the symmetry in this problem, the intensity emanating from the sphere surface is only a function of the exit angle. Examining Fig. 10- 5, we see that equation (10.29) reduces to

$$
I_{\eta}(\tau_{R},\theta) = \int_{0}^{\tau_{s}}I_{b\eta}(\tau_{s}^{\prime})e^{-(\tau_{s} - \tau_{s}^{\prime})}d\tau_{s}^{\prime}.
$$

But for a sphere

$$
\tau_{s} = 2\tau_{R}\cos \theta ,
$$

regardless of the azimuthal angle. Therefore, with  $I_{b\eta}(\tau_s') = I_{b\eta} = \mathrm{const}$ , the desired intensity turns out to be

$$
I_{\eta}(\tau_{\tau_{R}},\theta) = I_{b\eta}e^{-(2\tau_{R}\cos \theta -\tau_{s}^{\prime})}\Big|_{0}^{2\tau_{R}\cos \theta} = I_{b\eta}\big(1 - e^{-2\tau_{R}\cos \theta}\big).
$$

Thus, for  $\tau_{R} \gg 1$  the isothermal sphere emits equally into all directions, like a black surface at the same temperature.

# The Cold Medium

If the temperature of the medium is so low that the blackbody intensity at that temperature is small as compared with incident intensity, then the radiative transfer equation is decoupled from other modes of heat transfer. However, the governing equation remains a third- order integral equation, namely,

$$
I_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_{\eta}(0)e^{-\tau_{\eta}} + \int_{0}^{\tau_{\eta}}\frac{\omega_{\eta}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta}',\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i},\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega_{i}e^{-(\tau_{\eta} - \tau_{\eta}')}d\tau_{\eta}'. \tag{10.30}
$$

If the scattering is isotropic, or  $\Phi \equiv 1$ , the directional integration in equation (10.30) may be carried out, so that

$$
I_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_{\eta}(0)e^{-\tau_{\eta}} + \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\tau_{\eta}}\omega_{\eta}G_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta}^{\prime})e^{-(\tau_{\eta} - \tau_{\eta}^{\prime})}d\tau_{\eta^{\prime}}^{\prime} \tag{10.31}
$$

where

$$
G_{\eta}(\mathfrak{t})\equiv \int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta}^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})d\Omega_{i} \tag{10.32}
$$

is known as the incident radiation function (since it is the total intensity impinging on a point from all sides). The problem is then much simplified since it is only necessary to find a solution for  $G$  [by direction- integrating equation (10.31)] rather than determining the direction- dependent intensity.

# Purely Scattering Medium

If the medium scatters radiation, but does not absorb or emit, then the radiative transfer is again decoupled from other heat transfer modes. In this case  $\omega_{\eta} \equiv 1$ , and the radiative transfer equation reduces to a form essentially identical to equation (10.30), i.e.,

$$
I_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_{\eta}(0)e^{-\tau_{\eta}} + \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\tau_{\eta}}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta}',\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i},\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega_{i}e^{-(\tau_{\eta} - \tau_{\eta}')}d\tau_{\eta}'. \tag{10.33}
$$

Again, for isotropic scattering, this equation may be simplified by introducing the incident radiation, so that

$$
I_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_{\eta}(0)e^{-\tau_{\eta}} + \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\tau_{\eta}}G_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta}',\hat{\mathbf{s}})e^{-(\tau_{\eta} - \tau_{\eta}')}d\tau_{\eta}'. \tag{10.34}
$$

Example 10.2. A large isothermal black plate is covered with a thin layer of isotropically scattering, nonabsorbing (and, therefore, nonemitting) material with unity index of refraction. Assuming that the layer is so thin that any ray emitted from the plate is scattered at most once before leaving the scattering layer, estimate the radiative intensity above the layer in the direction normal to the plate.

# Solution

The exiting intensity in the normal direction (see Fig. 10- 6) may be calculated from equation (10.34) by retaining only terms of order  $\tau_{\eta}$  or higher (since  $\tau_{\eta} \ll 1$ ). This process leads to  $e^{- \tau_{\eta}} = 1 - \tau_{\eta} + \mathcal{O}(\tau_{\eta}^{2})$ ,

![](images/de703da6e7697ca18f2437d00cab28aa2dc8ed1d6b4cd1f25b2b8e16c866e550.jpg)  
FIGURE 10-6 Geometry for Example 10.2.

$G(\tau_{\eta}^{\prime}) = G(\tau_{\eta}) + \mathcal{O}(\tau_{\eta})$  (radiation to be scattered arrives unattenuated at a point), and  $e^{- (\tau_{\eta} - \tau_{\eta}^{\prime})} = 1 - \mathcal{O}(\tau_{\eta})$  (scattered radiation will leave the medium without further attenuation), so that

$$
I_{n\eta} = I_{b\eta}(1 - \tau_{\eta}) + \frac{1}{4\pi} G_{\eta}\tau_{\eta} + \mathcal{O}(\tau_{\eta}^{2}),
$$

where the intensity emanating from the plate is known since the plate is black. The incident radiation at any point is due to unattenuated emission from the bottom plate arriving from the lower  $2\pi$  solid angles, and nothing coming from the top  $2\pi$  solid angles, i.e.,  $G_{\eta} \approx 2\pi I_{b\eta}$  and

$$
I_{n\eta} = I_{b\eta}(1 - \tau_{\eta}) + \frac{1}{2} I_{b\eta}\tau_{\eta} + \mathcal{O}(\tau_{\eta}^{2}) = I_{b\eta}\left(1 - \frac{\tau_{\eta}}{2}\right) + \mathcal{O}(\tau_{\eta}^{2}).
$$

Physically this result tells us that the emission into the normal direction is attenuated by the fraction  $\tau_{\eta}$  (scattered away from the normal direction), and augmented by the fraction  $\tau_{\eta} / 2$  (scattered into the normal direction): Since scattering is isotropic, exactly half of the attenuation is scattered upward and half downward; the latter is then absorbed by the emitting plate. Thus, the scattering layer acts as a heat shield for the hot plate.

# 10.6 BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER EQUATION

The radiative transfer equation in its quasi- steady form, equation (10.21), is a first- order differential equation in intensity (for a fixed direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ ). As such, the equation requires knowledge of the radiative intensity at a single point in space, into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ . Generally, the point where the intensity can be specified independently lies on the surface of an enclosure surrounding the participating medium, as indicated by the formal solution in equation (10.28). This intensity, leaving a wall into a specified direction, may be determined by the methods given in Chapter 5 (diffusely emitting and reflecting surfaces), Chapter 6 (diffusely emitting and specularly reflecting surfaces) and Chapter 7 (surfaces with arbitrary characteristics).

# Diffusely Emitting and Reflecting Opaque Surfaces

For a surface that emits and reflects diffusely, the exiting intensity is independent of direction. Therefore, at a point  $\mathbf{r}_w$  on the surface, from equations (5.18) and (5.19),

$$
I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I(\mathbf{r}_w) = J(\mathbf{r}_w) / \pi = \epsilon (\mathbf{r}_w)I_b(\mathbf{r}_w) + \rho (\mathbf{r}_w)H(\mathbf{r}_w) / \pi , \tag{10.35}
$$

where  $H(\mathbf{r}_w)$  is the hemispherical irradiation (i.e., incoming radiative heat flux) defined by equation (3.41), leading to

$$
I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \epsilon (\mathbf{r}_w)I_b(\mathbf{r}_w) + \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}_w)}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '\prec 0}I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '|d\Omega ', \tag{10.36}
$$

where  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$  is the local outward surface normal and  $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}' = \cos \theta '$  is the cosine of the angle between any incoming direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} '$  and the surface normal, as indicated in Fig. 10- 7. Therefore, the

![](images/491415c7ea851f50db68714461e6a873878628ca391b673671ea87128925afd8.jpg)  
FIGURE 10-7 Radiative intensity reflected from a surface.

outgoing intensity is not generally known explicitly, but is related to the incoming intensity. An exception is the black surface, for which (with  $\rho = 0$ ),

$$
I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_b(\mathbf{r}_w). \tag{10.37}
$$

# Diffusely Emitting, Specularly Reflecting, Opaque Surfaces

If the reflectance of the surface has a specular as well as a diffuse component, i.e., the reflectance obeys equation (6.1), then the outgoing intensity also consists of two components. One part of the outgoing intensity is due to diffuse emission as well as the diffuse fraction of reflected energy, as described by equation (10.36). In addition, the outgoing intensity has a specularly reflected component, so that

$$
I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \epsilon (\mathbf{r}_w)I_b(\mathbf{r}_w) + \frac{\rho^d(\mathbf{r}_w)}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '\cdot < 0}I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '|d\Omega ' + \rho^s (\mathbf{r}_w)I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_s), \tag{10.38}
$$

where  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_s$  is the "specular direction," defined as the direction from which a light beam must hit the surface in order to travel into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  after a specular reflection. This direction is, from Fig. 10- 7,  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} +(- \hat{\mathbf{s}}_s) = 2\cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{n}}$ , or

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}_s = \hat{\mathbf{s}} -2(\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}})\hat{\mathbf{n}}. \tag{10.39}
$$

# Opaque Surfaces with Arbitrary Surface Properties

Reflection from a surface with nonideal radiative properties is governed by the bidirectional reflection function, as discussed in Chapter 7. From equation (7.10) it follows immediately that

$$
I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \epsilon '(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_b(\mathbf{r}_w) + \int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} < 0}\rho ''(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ',\hat{\mathbf{s}})I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '|d\Omega '. \tag{10.40}
$$

If the surface reflects diffusely,  $\rho '' = \rho^d /\pi$  and equation (10.40) reduces to equation (10.36). For specular reflection the development of equation (7.15) shows that it reduces to equation (10.38).

![](images/ff1e72c533e7067dc7eef4be0222363d015d740e66e2446c29369520e1440936.jpg)  
FIGURE 10-8 Radiation within a pencil of rays passing from medium to another with different refractive index (shown for  $n_1 > n_2$ ).

# Semitransparent Boundaries

If the boundary is a semitransparent wall, external radiation may penetrate into the enclosure and must be added to equations (10.36), (10.38), and (10.40) as  $I_{\alpha}(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}})$ . The emittance  $\epsilon$  in these boundary conditions is then an effective value for the internal emission from the entire semitransparent wall thickness. If the bounding surface is totally transparent (or simply an opening), then there is no emission from the boundary and  $\epsilon = 0$ . This type of boundary condition was discussed in some detail in Section 6.6.

# Interface Between Two Semitransparent Media

An interface between two semitransparent media is of interest only, if radiation can penetrate an appreciable distance through either medium—if not, the optically dense medium may be modeled as an "opaque surface." This implies that the absorptive indices of both media are very small [see equation (2.43)], and  $m = n - ik \simeq n$ . We will also assume that the interface is optically smooth, i.e., reflection can be modeled by Snell's law, as given by equations (2.72) and (3.59), together with Fresnel's relations, equations (2.96) and (3.60) (with  $n = n_2 / n_1$ ). If we perform an energy balance for a pencil of rays transmitted from Medium 1 into Medium 2 (as shown in Fig. 10- 8 for the case of  $n_1 > n_2$ ), we have from the definition of radiative intensity,

$$
I_{\nu 1}(\theta_1)(1 - \rho_{12})dt(dA\cos \theta_1)d\Omega_1d\nu = I_{\nu 2}(\theta_2)dt(dA\cos \theta_2)d\Omega_2d\nu , \tag{10.41}
$$

where  $dA$  is an infinitesimal area element on the interface, and we have chosen frequency  $\nu$  as the spectral variable, because only frequency remains unchanged as light passes through media with different refractive indices. Eliminating solid angle  $d\Omega = \sin \theta d\theta d\psi$  (and azimuthal angle  $\psi$ , which is unaffected by passing from one medium to the next), this simplifies to

$$
I_{\nu 1}(\theta_1)(1 - \rho_{12})\sin \theta_1\cos \theta_1d\theta_1 = I_{\nu 1}(\theta_2)\sin \theta_2\cos \theta_2d\theta_2. \tag{10.42}
$$

From Snell's law, equations (2.72) and (3.59), we have

$$
n_1\sin \theta_1 = n_2\sin \theta_2, \tag{10.43}
$$

Finally, sticking these two relations into equation (10.42), we obtain

$$
\frac{I_{\nu 1}(\theta_1)(1 - \rho_{12})}{n_1^2} = \frac{I_{\nu 2}(\theta_2)}{n_2^2}. \tag{10.44}
$$

Note that, since  $n_1 > n_2$ , refraction in Medium 2 is away from the surface normal, i.e.,  $\theta_2 > \theta_1$ , and there is a critical angle  $\theta_1 = \theta_c$ , as given by equation (2.100), at which  $\theta_2 = 90^\circ$  and for

![](images/1849ca52c6720a4c35904b8a3c62853fff6ed5061d55572e94bc972252c64316.jpg)  
FIGURE 10-9 Intensities leaving an interface between two semitransparent media with different refractive indices (shown for  $n_1 > n_2$ ).

larger  $\theta_{1}$  there will be total internal reflection, and nothing is transmitted into Medium 2:

$$
\theta_{1} > \theta_{c} = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}\right):\quad \rho_{12} = 1;I_{\nu 2}(\theta_{2}) = 0. \tag{10.45}
$$

This is indicated in Fig. 10- 9 by showing several additional incident directions (with thin dashed lines and open arrows), together with their transmitted (for  $\theta_{1}< \theta_{c}$  only) and reflected directions.

Employing equations (10.44) and (10.45), we can now make a full energy balance for the interface, comprising intensity coming in from inside Medium 1,  $I_{\nu 1i}(\theta_1)$ , the fraction of it that is reflected,  $I_{\nu 1r}(\theta_1)$  (with specular reflection angle  $\theta_{r} = \theta_{1}$ ), and the fraction transmitted into Medium 2,  $I_{\nu 1t}(\theta_2)$ , along with similar contributions from intensity striking the interface from inside Medium 2, as depicted in Fig. 10- 9:

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I_{\nu 2}(\theta_2) = \rho_{21}I_{\nu 2i}(\theta_2) + I_{\nu 1t}(\theta_2) = \rho_{21}I_{\nu 2i}(\theta_2) + (1 - \rho_{12})\left(\frac{n_2}{n_1}\right)^2 I_{\nu 1i}(\theta_1),}\\ {I_{\nu 1}(\theta_1) = \rho_{12}I_{\nu 1i}(\theta_1) + I_{\nu 2t}(\theta_1) = \rho_{12}I_{\nu 1i}(\theta_1) + (1 - \rho_{21})\left(\frac{n_1}{n_2}\right)^2 I_{\nu 2i}(\theta_2),} \end{array} \tag{10.46b}
$$

where, from equation (2.96),

$$
\rho_{12} = \rho_{21} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{n_1\cos\theta_2 - n_2\cos\theta_1}{n_1\cos\theta_2 + n_2\cos\theta_1}\right)^2 +\left(\frac{n_1\cos\theta_1 - n_2\cos\theta_2}{n_1\cos n_1 + n_2\cos\theta_2}\right)^2\right], & \theta_1< \theta_c,\\ 1 & \theta_1\geq \theta_c. \end{array} \right. \tag{10.47}
$$

The intensity entering the optically less dense Medium 2 from the interface,  $I_{\nu 2}(\theta_2)$ , will have a transmitted contribution from Medium 1 for all values of  $\theta_{2}$  (but coming from within a cone with opening angle  $\theta_{c}$ ). Intensity entering Medium 1,  $I_{\nu 1}(\theta_1)$ , on the other hand, will have a transmitted component from Medium 2 only if  $\theta_{1}< \theta_{c}$ .

# 10.7 RADIATION ENERGY DENSITY

A volume element inside an enclosure is irradiated from all directions and, at any instant in time  $t$ , contains a certain amount of radiative energy in the form of photons. Consider, for

example, an element  $dV = dAds$  irradiated perpendicularly to  $dA$  with intensity  $I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})$  as shown in Fig. 10- 3. Therefore, per unit time radiative energy in the amount of  $I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega dA$  enters  $dV$  From the development in Chapter 1, equation (1.48), we see that this energy remains inside  $dV$  for a duration of  $dt = ds / c,$  before exiting at the other side. Thus, due to irradiation from a single direction, the volume contains the amount of radiative energy  $I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega dAds / c = I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega dV / c$  at any instant in time. Adding the contributions from all possible directions, we find the total radiative energy stored within  $dV$  is  $u_{\eta}dV,$  where  $u_{\eta}$  is the spectral radiation energy density

$$
u_{\eta}\equiv \frac{1}{c}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega . \tag{10.48}
$$

Integration over the spectrum gives the total radiation energy density,

$$
u = \int_{0}^{\infty}u_{\eta}d\eta = \frac{1}{c}\int_{4\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\eta d\Omega = \frac{1}{c}\int_{4\pi}I(\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega . \tag{10.49}
$$

Although the radiation energy density is a very basic quantity akin to internal energy for energy stored within matter, it is not widely used by heat transfer engineers. Instead, it is common practice to employ the incident radiation  $G_{\eta}$ , which is related to the energy density through

$$
G_{\eta}\equiv \int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega = cu_{\eta};\quad G = cu. \tag{10.50}
$$

# 10.8 RADIATIVE HEAT FLUX

The spectral radiative heat flux onto a surface element has been expressed in terms of incident and outgoing intensity in equation (1.39) as

$$
{\mathfrak{q}}_{\eta}\cdot\hat{\mathfrak{n}}=\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}\hat{\mathfrak{n}}\cdot\hat{\mathfrak{s}}d\Omega. \tag{10.51}
$$

This relationship also holds, of course, for a hypothetical (i.e., totally transmissive) surface element placed arbitrarily inside an enclosure. Removing the surface normal from equation (1.39), we obtain the definition for the spectral, radiative heat flux vector inside a participating medium. To obtain the total radiative heat flux, equation (10.51) needs to be integrated over the spectrum, and

$$
{\mathfrak{q}}=\int_{0}^{\infty}{\mathfrak{q}}_{\eta}d\eta=\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{s}}d\Omega d\eta. \tag{10.52}
$$

Depending on the coordinate system used, or the surface being described, the radiative heat flux vector may be separated into its coordinate components, for example  $q_{x}, q_{y},$  and  $q_{z}$  (for a Cartesian coordinate system), or into components normal and tangential to a surface, and so on.

Example 10.3. Evaluate the total heat loss from an isothermal spherical medium bounded by vacuum, assuming that  $\kappa_{\eta} =$  const (i.e., does not vary with location, temperature, or wavenumber).

# Solution

Here we are dealing with a spherical coordinate system, and we are interested in the radial component of the radiative heat flux (the other two being equal to zero by symmetry). We saw in Example 10.1 that the intensity emanating from the sphere is

$$
I_{\eta}(\tau_{R},\theta) = I_{b\eta}\left(1 - e^{-2\tau_{R}\cos \theta}\right),\quad 0\leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2},
$$

where  $\theta$  is measured from the surface normal pointing away from the sphere (Fig. 10- 5). Since the sphere is bounded by vacuum, there is no incoming radiation and

$$
I_{\eta}(\tau_{R},\theta) = 0,\quad \frac{\pi}{2}\leq \theta \leq \pi .
$$

Therefore, from equation (10.52),

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q(\tau_{R}) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}I_{\eta}(\tau_{R},\theta)\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\psi d\eta}\\ {= 2\pi \int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{\pi /2}I_{b\eta}\left(1 - e^{-2\tau_{R}\cos \theta}\right)\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\eta}\\ {= \pi I_{b}\left\{1 - \frac{1}{2\tau_{R}^{2}}\left[1 - (1 + 2\tau_{R})e^{-2\tau_{R}}\right]\right\} = n^{2}\sigma T^{4}\left\{1 - \frac{1}{2\tau_{R}^{2}}\left[1 - (1 + 2\tau_{R})e^{-2\tau_{R}}\right]\right\} ,} \end{array}
$$

where  $\pi$  is the refractive index of the medium (usually  $n \approx 1$  for gases, but  $n > 1$  for semitransparent liquids and solids). As discussed in the previous example, if  $\tau_{R} \to \infty$  the heat flux approaches the same value as the one from a black surface.

If the sphere in the last example is optically thin  $\tau_{R} \ll 1$  (i.e., the medium emits radiative energy, but does not absorb any of the emitted energy), then the total heat loss (total emission) from the sphere is

$$
\begin{array}{r}Q = 4\pi R^2 q = 4\pi R^2\times \frac{4}{3}\tau_Rn^2\sigma T^4 = 4\kappa n^2\sigma T^4 V. \end{array} \tag{10.53}
$$

This result may be generalized to govern emission from any isothermal volume  $V$  without self- absorption, or

$$
Q_{\mathrm{emission}} = 4\kappa n^2\sigma T^4 V. \tag{10.54}
$$

# 10.9 DIVERGENCE OF THE RADIATIVE HEAT FLUX

While the heat transfer engineer is interested in the radiative heat flux, this interest usually holds true only for fluxes at physical boundaries. Inside the medium, on the other hand, we need to know how much net radiative energy is deposited into (or withdrawn from) each volume element. Thus, making a radiative energy balance on an infinitesimal volume  $dV = dxdydz$  as shown in Fig. 10- 10, we have

$$
\left( \begin{array}{c}\mathrm{radiative~energy}\\ \mathrm{stored~in~}dV\\ \mathrm{per~unit~time} \end{array} \right) - \left( \begin{array}{c}\mathrm{rad.~energy~generated}\\ \mathrm{(emitted)~by~}dV\\ \mathrm{per~unit~time} \end{array} \right) + \left( \begin{array}{c}\mathrm{rad.~energy~destroyed}\\ \mathrm{(absorbed)~by~}dV\\ \mathrm{per~unit~time} \end{array} \right)
$$

$$
= \left( \begin{array}{c}{\mathrm{flux~in~at~}x - \mathrm{flux~out~at~}x + dx}\\ {+\mathrm{flux~in~at~}y - \mathrm{flux~out~at~}y + dy}\\ {+\mathrm{flux~in~at~}z - \mathrm{flux~out~at~}z + dz} \end{array} \right).
$$

The right- hand side may be written in mathematical form as

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & q(x)dydz - q(x + dx)dydz\\ & +q(y)dxdz - q(y + dy)dxdz\\ & +q(z)dxdy - q(z + dz)dxdy \end{array} \left\} = -(\frac{\partial q}{\partial x} +\frac{\partial q}{\partial y} +\frac{\partial q}{\partial z})dxdydz = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}dV.
$$

Thus, within the overall energy equation, it is the divergence of the radiative heat flux that is of interest inside the participating medium.4

We have already established an energy balance for thermal radiation, the radiative transfer equation [for example, equation (10.21)],

$$
\frac{dI_{\eta}}{ds} = \hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla I_{\eta} = \kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta} - \beta_{\eta}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + \frac{\sigma_{5\eta}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}},\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega_i, \tag{10.55}
$$

![](images/27c86c4be2a62abb1ae4498758440dca1932699219c8899047182f9008527732.jpg)  
FIGURE 10-10 Control volume for derivation of divergence of radiative heat flux.

which is a radiation balance for an infinitesimal pencil of rays. Thus, in order to get a volume balance, we integrate this equation over all solid angles, or

$$
\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla I_{\eta}d\Omega = \int_{4\pi}\kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta}d\Omega -\int_{4\pi}\beta_{\eta}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega +\int_{4\pi}\frac{\sigma_{s\eta}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega_id\Omega_i, \tag{10.56}
$$

and

$$
\nabla \cdot \int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = 4\pi \kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta} - \int_{4\pi}\beta_{\eta}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega +\frac{\sigma_{s\eta}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\left(\int_{4\pi}\Phi_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega\right)d\Omega_i. \tag{10.57}
$$

On the left side of equation (10.57) the integral and the direction vector were taken into the gradient since direction and space coordinates are all independent from one another. The expression inside the operator is now, of course, the spectral radiative heat flux. On the right side of equation (10.57) the order of integration has been changed, applying the  $\Omega$ - integration to the only part depending on it, the scattering phase function  $\Phi_{\eta}$ . This last integration can be carried out using equation (10.17), leading to

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}_{\eta} = 4\pi \kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta} - \beta_{\eta}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega +\sigma_{s\eta}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)d\Omega_i. \tag{10.58}
$$

Since  $\Omega$  and  $\Omega_{i}$  are dummy arguments for integration over all solid angles, the last two terms can be pulled together, using  $\kappa_{\eta} = \beta_{\eta} - \sigma_{s\eta}$ .

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}_{\eta} = \kappa_{\eta}\left(4\pi I_{b\eta} - \int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}d\Omega\right) = \kappa_{\eta}\left(4\pi I_{b\eta} - G_{\eta}\right). \tag{10.59}
$$

Equation (10.59) states that physically the net loss of radiative energy from a control volume is equal to emitted energy minus absorbed irradiation. This direction- integrated form of the radiative transfer equation no longer contains the scattering coefficient. This fact is not surprising since scattering only redirects the stream of photons; it does not affect the energy content of any given unit volume.

Equation (10.59) is a spectral relationship, i.e., it gives the heat flux per unit wavenumber at a certain spectral position. If the divergence of the total heat flux is desired, the integration over the spectrum is carried out to give

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = \nabla \cdot \int_{0}^{\infty}\mathbf{q}_{\eta}d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta}\left(4\pi I_{b\eta} - \int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}d\Omega\right)d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta}\left(4\pi I_{b\eta} - G_{\eta}\right)d\eta . \tag{10.60}
$$

Equation (10.60) is a statement of the conservation of radiative energy. For the special case of a gray medium ( $\kappa_{\eta} = \kappa =$  constant) this may be simplified to

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = \kappa \left(4\sigma T^4 -\int_{4\pi}I d\Omega\right) = \kappa \left(4\sigma T^4 -G\right). \tag{10.61}
$$

Example 10.4. Calculate the divergence of the total radiative heat flux at the center and at the surface of the gray, isothermal spherical medium in the previous example.

# Solution

We already know the intensity at the surface of the sphere and, therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{G_{\eta}(\tau_R) = 2\pi \int_0^\pi \sin \theta I_\eta d\theta = 2\pi I_{b\eta}\int_0^{\pi /2}\left(1 - e^{-2\tau_R\cos \theta}\right)\sin \theta d\theta}\\ {= 2\pi I_{b\eta}\left(1 - \frac{e^{-2\tau_R\cos\theta}}{2\tau_R}\Bigg|_0^{\pi /2}\right) = \frac{\pi I_{b\eta}}{\tau_R}\left(2\tau_R - 1 + e^{-2\tau_R}\right),} \end{array}
$$

and

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}(\tau_R) = \kappa (4\pi I_b - G) = \frac{\sigma T^4}{R}\left(2\tau_R + 1 - e^{-2\tau_R}\right). \tag{10.62}
$$

At the center of the sphere the intensity is easily evaluated as

$$
I_{\eta}(0) = I_{b\eta}\left(1 - e^{-\tau_R}\right),
$$

and

$$
G_{\eta}(0) = 4\pi I_{b\eta}\left(1 - e^{-\tau_R}\right),
$$

so that

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}(0) = \kappa 4\sigma T^4 e^{-\tau_R}. \tag{10.63}
$$

The right- hand sides of equations (10.62) and (10.63) are radiative heat losses per unit time and volume, which must be made up for by a volumetric heat source if the sphere is to stay isothermal.

# 10.10 INTEGRAL FORMULATION OF THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER EQUATION

In order to obtain incident radiation, radiative heat flux, or its divergence, it is sometimes desirable to use an integral formulation of the radiative transfer equation. We start with the formal solution, equation (10.28), but rewritten in terms of the vectors shown in Fig. 10- 11,

$$
I_{\eta}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_{w\eta}(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}})\exp \left[-\int_0^s\beta_\eta ds^{\prime \prime}\right] + \int_0^s S_\eta (\mathbf{r}',\hat{\mathbf{s}})\exp \left[-\int_0^{s^{\prime \prime}}\beta_\eta ds^{\prime \prime}\right]\beta_\eta ds^{\prime \prime}, \tag{10.64}
$$

where  $s = |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_w|$  and the direction of integration has been switched to go along  $s^{\prime \prime}$  (from point  $\mathbf{r}$  toward the wall). From the definition of the incident radiation, equation (10.32), we have

$$
G_{\eta}(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{4\pi}I_{w\eta}(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}})\exp \left[-\int_0^s\beta_\eta ds''\right]d\Omega +\int_{4\pi}\int_0^s S_\eta (\mathbf{r}',\hat{\mathbf{s}})\exp \left[-\int_0^{s''}\beta_\eta ds''\right]\beta_\eta ds''d\Omega , \tag{10.65}
$$

with, from equation (1.26),

$$
d\Omega = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{dA^{\prime\prime}}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}^{\prime}|^{2}}, & \mathrm{inside~volume},\\ \displaystyle \frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}}dA_{w}}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_{w}|^{2}}, & \mathrm{at~the~wall}, \end{array} \right. \tag{10.66}
$$

where  $dA^{\prime \prime}$  is an infinitesimal area perpendicular to the integration path (and  $ds^{\prime \prime}$ ), such that  $dV = ds^{\prime \prime}dA^{\prime \prime}$  is an infinitesimal volume. Therefore, equation (10.65) may be rewritten as

$$
G_{\eta}(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{A_{w}}I_{w\eta}(\mathbf{r}_{w},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\exp \left[-\int_{0}^{s}\beta_{\eta}ds^{\prime \prime}\right]\frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}}dA_{w}}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_{w}|^{2}} +\int_{V}S_{\eta}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\exp \left[-\int_{0}^{s^{\prime \prime}}\beta_{\eta}ds^{\prime \prime}\right]\frac{\beta_{\eta}dV}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}^{\prime}|^{2}}, \tag{10.67}
$$

with the local unit direction vector found from

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \frac{\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}^{\prime}}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}^{\prime}|}. \tag{10.68}
$$

The radiative flux (and any higher moment) can be determined similarly, after first multiplying equation (10.64) by  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , as

$$
\mathbf{q}_{\eta}(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{A_{w}}I_{w\eta}(\mathbf{r}_{w},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\exp \left[-\int_{0}^{s}\beta_{\eta}ds^{\prime \prime}\right]\frac{(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{s}}dA_{w}}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_{w}|^{2}} +\int_{V}S_{\eta}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\exp \left[-\int_{0}^{s^{\prime \prime}}\beta_{\eta}ds^{\prime \prime}\right]\frac{\beta_{\eta}\hat{\mathbf{s}}dV}{|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}^{\prime}|^{2}}. \tag{10.69}
$$

For a nonscattering medium  $S_{\eta} = I_{b\eta}$ , and equation (10.67) is the explicit solution for incident radiation  $G_{\eta}$ , provided the temperature field is known, and if the walls are black. For isotropic scattering the source function depends only on  $I_{b\eta}$  (or temperature) and incident radiation. For such a case (and if the walls are black) equation (10.67) is a single, independent integral equation for the incident radiation; once  $G_{\eta}$  has been determined  $\mathbf{q}_{\eta}$  is found from equation (10.69). For reflecting walls and anisotropic scattering, equations (10.67) and (10.69) (and, perhaps, higher- order moments) must be solved simultaneously. Also, for a nonparticipating medium  $(\beta_{\eta} = 0)$  with diffusely reflecting surfaces  $(I_{w} = J / \pi)$ , equation (5.25) is readily recovered from equation (10.69); this is left as an exercise (Problem 10.15).

Example 10.5. Repeat Example 10.3 using the integral formulation of the RTE.

# Solution

In this simple problem with a cold, black (i.e., nonreflecting) wall with  $I_{w\eta} = 0$ , and in the absence of scattering with  $S_{\eta} = I_{b\eta} = \text{const}$  we can determine  $q_{\eta}$  directly from equation (10.69) as

$$
q_{\eta}(R) = -\mathbf{q}_{\eta}(\mathbf{r}_{w})\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = -I_{b\eta}\kappa_{\eta}\int_{V}e^{-\kappa_{\eta}s^{\prime \prime}}\frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}}dV}{(s^{\prime\prime})^{2}},
$$

where  $s^{\prime \prime}$  is the distance between any point inside the medium (at  $\mathbf{r}^{\prime}$ ) and the chosen point on the wall,  $\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_w$ . It is tempting at this point to introduce a spherical coordinate system at the center of the sphere to evaluate the volume integral for  $q_{\eta}$ ; however, this would lead to a very difficult integral. Instead, we introduce a spherical coordinate system at the chosen point at the wall, i.e.,  $\mathbf{r}_w = \mathbf{0}$  (point  $\tau_s$  in Fig. 10- 5). An arbitrary location inside the sphere can then be specified as

$$
\mathbf{r}^{\prime} = -\hat{\mathbf{s}} s^{\prime \prime} = s^{\prime \prime}(\cos \psi \sin \theta \hat{\mathbf{t}} +\sin \psi \sin \theta \hat{\mathbf{j}} +\cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{k}}),
$$

where  $\hat{\mathbf{k}} = \hat{\mathbf{n}}$  is pointing toward the center of the sphere and  $\hat{\mathbf{I}}$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{\eta}}$  are arbitrary (as long as they form a right- handed coordinate system). Then, with a maximum value for  $s_{\mathrm{max}}^{\prime \prime} = 2R\cos \theta$ , as given in Example 10.1,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q_{\eta}(R) = -I_{b\eta}\kappa_{\eta}\int_{\psi = 0}^{2\pi}\int_{\theta = 0}^{\pi /2}\int_{s^{\prime \prime} = 0}^{2R\cos \theta}e^{-\kappa_{\eta}s^{\prime \prime}}\frac{(-\cos\theta)\sin\theta\theta d\psi(s^{\prime\prime})^{2}ds^{\prime\prime}}{(s^{\prime\prime})^{2}}}\\ {= 2\pi I_{b\eta}\int_{\theta = 0}^{\pi /2}(1 - e^{-2\tau_{R}\cos \theta})\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta ,} \end{array}
$$

exactly as in Example 10.3.

# 10.11 OVERALL ENERGY CONSERVATION

Thermal radiation is only one mode of transferring heat which, in general, must compete with conductive and convective heat transfer. Therefore, the temperature field must be determined through an energy conservation equation that incorporates all three modes of heat transfer. The radiation intensity, through emission and temperature- dependent properties, depends on the temperature field and, therefore, cannot be decoupled from the overall energy equation.

The general form of the energy conservation equation for a moving compressible fluid may be stated as

$$
\rho \frac{D u}{D t} = \rho \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} +\mathbf{v}\cdot \nabla u\right) = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} - p\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mu \Phi +\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}, \tag{10.70}
$$

where  $u$  is internal energy,  $\mathbf{v}$  is the velocity vector,  $\mathbf{q}$  is the total heat flux vector,  $\Phi$  is the dissipation function, and  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}$  is heat generated within the medium (such as energy release due to chemical reactions). For a detailed derivation of equation (10.70), the reader is referred to standard textbooks such as [6,7]. If the medium is radiatively participating through emission, absorption, and scattering, then the conservation equations for momentum and energy are altered by three effects [8]:

1. The heat flux term in equation (10.70), which without radiation is in most applications due only to molecular diffusion (heat conduction), now has a second component, the radiative heat flux, due to radiative energy interacting with the medium within the control volume. 
2. The internal energy now contains a radiative contribution [the incident radiation  $G$ , due to the first term in equation (10.20)]. 
3. The radiation pressure tensor must be added to the traditional fluid dynamics pressure tensor.

We have already seen that the second effect is almost always negligible, and the same is true for the augmentation of the pressure tensor. Under these conditions the energy conservation equation can be simplified. If we assume that  $du = c_{v}dT$ , and that Fourier's law for heat conduction holds,

$$
\mathbf{q} = \mathbf{q}_c + \mathbf{q}_R = -k\nabla T + \mathbf{q}_R, \tag{10.71}
$$

equation (10.70) becomes

$$
\begin{array}{l}\rho c_{\mathrm{c}}\frac{DT}{Dt} = \rho c_{v}\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} +\mathbf{v}\cdot \nabla T\right)\\ \displaystyle = \nabla \cdot (k\nabla T) - p\nabla \cdot \mathbf{v} + \mu \Phi +\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}_{R}. \end{array} \tag{10.72}
$$

This is an integro- differential equation for the calculation of the temperature field, since the evaluation of the divergence of the radiative heat flux must come from (10.59), which is an

integral equation in temperature. Obviously, a complete solution of this equation, even with the recent advent of supercomputers, is a truly formidable task.

Example 10.6. State the radiative transfer equation and its boundary conditions for the case of combined steady- state conduction and radiation within a one- dimensional, planar, gray, and nonscattering medium, bounded by isothermal black walls.

# Solution

Since the problem is steady state and there is no movement in the medium, the left side of equation (10.72) vanishes, and only the first (conduction) and last (radiation) terms on the right side remain. For a one- dimensional planar medium this reduces to<sup>6</sup>

$$
\frac{d}{dz}\left(k\frac{dT}{dz} -q_R\right) = 0, \tag{10.73}
$$

and the divergence of radiative heat flux is related to temperature and incident radiation through equation (10.59),

$$
\frac{dq_R}{dz} = \kappa (4\sigma T^4 -G),
$$

where the spectral integration for the gray medium has been carried out by simply dropping the subscript  $\eta$ . Finally, the incident radiation is found from direction- integrating equation (10.29) (not a trivial task). The necessary boundary conditions are  $T = T_{i}, i = 1,2$  at the two walls (for conduction) and  $I(0,\mathfrak{s}) = \sigma T_i^4 /\pi$  (for radiation) needed in equation (10.29). Solution of this seemingly simple problem is by no means trivial, and can only be achieved through relatively involved numerical analysis.

# Radiative Equilibrium

Much attention in the following chapters will be given to the situation in which radiation is the dominant mode of heat transfer, meaning that when conduction and convection are negligible. This situation is referred to as radiative equilibrium, meaning that thermodynamic equilibrium within the medium is achieved by virtue of thermal radiation alone. As is commonly done in the discussion of "pure" conduction or convection, we allow volumetric heat sources throughout the medium. Thus, we may write

$$
\rho c_v\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} +\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}_R = \dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}, \tag{10.74}
$$

which is identical in form to the basic transient heat conduction equation (before substitution of Fourier's law). In the vast majority of cases radiative transfer occurs so fast that radiative equilibrium is achieved before a noticeable change in temperature occurs [i.e., when the unsteady term in equation (10.20) can be dropped]. Then the statement of radiative equilibrium reduces to its steady- state form

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}_R = \dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}. \tag{10.75}
$$

Radiative equilibrium is often a good assumption in applications with extremely high temperatures, such as plasmas, nuclear explosions, and such. The inclusion of a volumetric heat source allows the treatment of conduction and convection "through the back door:" A guess is made for the temperature field and the nonradiation terms in equation (10.72) are calculated to give  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}$  for the radiation calculations. This process is then repeated until a convergence criterion is met.

# 10.12 SOLUTION METHODS FOR THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER EQUATION

10.12 SOLUTION METHODS FOR THE RADIATIVE TRANSFER EQUATIONExact analytical solutions to the radiative transfer equation [equation (10.21)] are exceedingly difficult, and explicit solutions are impossible for all but the very simplest situations. Therefore, research on radiative heat transfer in participating media has generally proceeded in two directions: (i) exact (analytical and numerical) solutions of highly idealized situations, and (ii) approximate solution methods for more involved scenarios. Phenomena that make a radiative heat transfer problem difficult may be placed into four different categories:

Geometry: The problem may be one- dimensional, two- dimensional, or three- dimensional. Most investigations to date have dealt with one- dimensional geometries, and the vast majority of these dealt with the simplest case of a one- dimensional plane- parallel slab.

Temperature Field: The least difficult situation arises if the temperature profile within the medium is known, making equation (10.21) a relatively "simple" integral equation. Consequently, the most basic case of an isothermal medium has been studied extensively. Alternatively, if radiative equilibrium prevails, the temperature field is unknown but uncoupled from conduction and convection, and must be found from directional and spectral integration of the radiative transfer equation. In the most complicated scenario, radiative heat transfer is combined with conduction and/or convection, resulting in a highly nonlinear integro- differential equation.

Scattering: The solution to a radiation problem is greatly simplified if the medium does not scatter. In that case the radiative transfer equation reduces to a simple first- order differential equation if the temperature field is known, and a relatively simpler integral equation if radiative equilibrium prevails. If scattering must be considered, isotropic scattering is often assumed. Relatively few investigations have dealt with the case of anisotropic scattering, and most of those are limited to the case of linear- anisotropic scattering (see Section 12.9).

Properties: Although most participating media display strong nongray character, as discussed in the following three chapters, the vast majority of investigations to date have centered on the study of gray media. In addition, while radiative properties also generally depend strongly on temperature, concentration, etc., most calculations are limited to situations with constant properties.

Most "exact" solutions are limited to gray media with constant properties in one- dimensional, mainly plane- parallel geometries. The media are isothermal or at radiative equilibrium, and if they scatter, the scattering is usually isotropic. Since the usefulness of such one- dimensional solutions in heat transfer applications is limited, they are only briefly discussed in Chapter 14.

Several chapters are devoted to the various approximate methods that have been devised for the solution of the radiative transfer equation. Still, these seven chapters by no means cover all the different methods that have been and still are used by investigators in the field. A number of approximate methods for one- dimensional problems are discussed in Chapter 15. The optically thin and diffusion (or optically thick) approximations have historically been developed for a one- dimensional plane- parallel medium, but can readily be applied to more complicated geometries. Similarly, the Schuster- Schwarzschild or two- flux approximation [9, 10] is a forerunner to the multidimensional discrete ordinates method. In this method the intensity is assumed to be constant over discrete parts of the total solid angle of  $4\pi$ . Several other flux methods exist, but they are usually tailored toward special geometries, and cannot easily be applied to other scenarios, for example, the six- flux methods of Chu and Churchill [11] and Shih and coworkers [12, 13]. Another early one- dimensional model was the moment method or Eddington approximation [14]. In this model the directional dependence is expressed by a truncated series representation (rather than discretized). In general geometries this expansion

is usually achieved through the use of spherical harmonics, leading to the spherical harmonics method. Several variations to the moment method that are tailored toward specific geometries have been proposed [15, 16], but these are of limited general utility. Finally, the exponential kernel approximation, already discussed in Chapter 5 for surface radiation problems, may be used as a tool for many one- dimensional problems. However, its extension to multidimensional geometries is problematic.

A survey of the literature over the past forty years demonstrates that some solution methods have been used frequently, while others that appeared promising at one time are no longer employed on a regular basis. Apparently, some methods have been found to be more readily adapted to more difficult situations than others (such as multidimensionality, variable properties, anisotropic scattering, and/or nongray effects). The majority of radiative heat transfer analyses today appear to use one of four methods: (i) the spherical harmonics method or a variation of it, (ii) the discrete ordinates method or its more modern form, the finite volume method, (iii) the zonal method, and (iv) the Monte Carlo method. The first two of these have already been discussed briefly above with the one- dimensional approximations. The zonal method was developed by Hottel [17] in his pioneering work on furnace heat transfer. Unlike the spherical harmonics and discrete ordinates methods, the zonal method approximates spatial, rather than directional, behavior by breaking up an enclosure into finite, isothermal subvolumes. On the other hand, the Monte Carlo method [18] is a statistical method, in which the history of bundles of photons is traced as they travel through the enclosure. While the statistical nature of the Monte Carlo method makes it difficult to match it with other calculations, it is the only method that can satisfactorily deal with effects of irregular radiative properties (nonideal directional and/or nongray behavior).

Because of their importance, an entire chapter is devoted to each of these four solution methods. Several other methods that can be found in the literature are not covered in this book (except for brief descriptions in appropriate places). For example, the discrete transfer method, proposed by Shah [19] and Lockwood and Shah [20], combines features of the discrete ordinates, zonal, and Monte Carlo methods. Another hybrid proposed by Edwards [21] combines elements of the Monte Carlo and zonal methods.

# Problems

10.1 A semi- infinite medium  $0 \leq z < \infty$  consists of a gray, absorbing- emitting gas that does not scatter, bounded by vacuum at the interface  $z = 0$ . The gas is isothermal at  $1000 \mathrm{~K}$ , and the absorption coefficient is  $\kappa = 1 \mathrm{~m}^{- 1}$ . The interface is nonreflecting; conduction and convection may be neglected.

(a) What is the local heat generation that is necessary to keep the gas at  $1000 \mathrm{~K}$ ?  
(b) What is the intensity distribution at the interface, that is,  $I(z = 0, \theta , \psi)$ , for all  $\theta$  and  $\psi$ ?  
(c) What is the total heat flux leaving the semi-infinite medium?

10.2 Reconsider the semi- infinite medium of Problem 10.1 for a temperature distribution of  $T = T_{0} e^{- z / L}$ ,  $T_{0} = 1000 \mathrm{~K}$ ,  $L = 1 \mathrm{~m}$ . What are the exiting intensity and heat flux for this case? Discuss how the answer would change if  $\kappa$  varied between 0 and  $\infty$ .

10.3 Repeat Problem 10.1 for a medium of thickness  $L = 1 \mathrm{~m}$ . Discuss how the answer would change if  $\kappa$  varied between 0 and  $\infty$ .

10.4 A semi- infinite, gray, nonscattering medium  $(n = 2, \kappa = 1 \mathrm{~m}^{- 1})$  is irradiated by the sun normal to its surface at a rate of  $I_{\mathrm{sun}} = 1000 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ . Neglecting emission from the relatively cold medium, determine the local heat generation rate due to absorption of solar energy.

Hint: The solar radiation may be thought of as being due to a radiative intensity which has a large value  $I_{0}$  over a very small cone of solid angles  $\delta \Omega$ , and is zero elsewhere, i.e.,

$$
I(\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}I_{o} & \mathrm{over}\delta \Omega \mathrm{along}\hat{\mathbf{n}},\\ 0 & \mathrm{elsewhere}, \end{array} \right.
$$

and

$$
q_{\mathrm{sun}} = \int_{4\pi}I(\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = I_{o}\delta \Omega .

10.6 A semitransparent sphere of radius  $R = 10 \mathrm{~cm}$  has a parabolic temperature profile  $T = T_{c}(1 - r^{2} / R^{2})$ ,  $T_{c} = 2000 \mathrm{~K}$ . The sphere is gray with  $\kappa = 0.1 \mathrm{~cm}^{- 1}$ ,  $n = 1.0$ , does not scatter, and has nonreflective boundaries. Outline how to calculate the total heat loss from the sphere (i.e., there is no need actually to carry out cumbersome integrations).

10.7 Repeat Problem 10.6, but assume that the temperature is uniform at  $2000 \mathrm{~K}$ . What must the local production of heat be if the sphere is to remain at  $2000 \mathrm{~K}$  everywhere? Note: The answer may be left in integral form (which must be solved numerically). Carry out the integration for  $r = 0$  and  $r = R$ .

10.8 Repeat Problem 10.6, but assume that the temperature is uniform at  $2000\mathrm{K}$ . Also, there is no heat production, meaning that the sphere cools down. How long will it take for the sphere to cool down to  $500\mathrm{K}$  (the heat capacity of the medium is  $\rho c = 1000\mathrm{kJ} / \mathrm{m}^3\mathrm{K}$  and the conductivity is very large, i.e., the sphere is isothermal at all times)?

10.9 A relatively cold sphere with a radius of  $R_{o} = 1\mathrm{m}$  consists of a nonscattering gray medium that absorbs with an absorption coefficient of  $\kappa = 0.1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  and has a refractive index  $n = 2$ . At the center of the sphere is a small black sphere with radius  $R_{i} = 1\mathrm{cm}$  at a temperature of  $1000\mathrm{K}$ . On the outside, the sphere is bounded by vacuum. What is the total heat flux leaving the sphere? Explain what happens as  $\kappa$  is increased from zero to a large value.

10.10 A laser beam is directed onto the atmosphere of a (hypothetical) planet. The planet's atmosphere contains  $0.01\%$  by volume of an absorbing gas. The absorbing gas has a molecular weight of 20 and, at the laser wavelength, an absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{\eta} = 10^{- 4}\mathrm{cm}^{- 1} / (\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{m}^{3})$ . It is known that the pressure and temperature distributions of the atmosphere can be approximated by  $p = p_0e^{- 2z / L}$  and  $T = T_0e^{- z / L}$ , where  $p_0 = 0.75\mathrm{atm}$ ,  $T_0 = 400\mathrm{K}$  are values at the planet's surface  $z = 0$ , and  $L = 2\mathrm{km}$  is a characteristic length. What fraction of the laser energy arrives at the planet's surface?

10.11 A  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  laser with a total power output of  $Q = 10\mathrm{W}$  is directed (at right angle) onto a  $10\mathrm{cm}$  thick, isothermal, absorbing/emitting (but not scattering) medium at  $1000\mathrm{K}$ . It is known that the laser beam is essentially monochromatic at a wavelength of  $10.6\mu \mathrm{m}$  with a Gaussian power distribution. Thus, the intensity falling onto the medium is

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I(0)\propto e^{-\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^2} / (\delta \Omega \delta \eta),\quad 0\leq r\leq \infty ;}\\ {Q = \int_AI(0)dA\delta \Omega \delta \eta ,} \end{array}
$$

where  $r$  is distance from beam center,  $R = 100\mu \mathrm{m}$  is the "effective radius" of the laser beam,  $\delta \Omega = 5\times 10^{- 3}\mathrm{ar}$  is the range of solid angles over which the laser beam outputs intensity (assumed uniform over  $\delta \Omega$ ), and  $\delta \eta$  is the range of wavenumbers over which the intensity is distributed (also assumed uniform). At  $10.6\mu \mathrm{m}$  the medium is known to have an absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{\eta} = 0.15\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . Assuming that the medium has nonreflecting boundaries, determine the exiting total intensity in the normal direction (transmitted laser radiation plus emission, assuming the medium to be gray). Is the emission contribution important? How thick would the medium have to be to make transmission and emission equally important?

10.12 Repeat Problem 10.11 for a medium with refractive index  $n = 2$ , bounded by vacuum (i.e., a slab with reflecting surfaces). Hint: (1) Part of the laser beam will be reflected when first hitting the slab, part will penetrate into the slab. Part of this energy will be absorbed by the layer, part will hit the rear face, where a fraction will be reflected back into the slab, and the rest will emerge from the slab, etc. Similar multiple internal reflections will take place with the emitted energy before emerging from the slab. (2) To calculate the slab- surroundings reflectance, show that the value of the absorptive index is negligible.

10.13 A thin column of gas of cross- section  $\delta A$  and length  $L$  contains a uniform suspension of small particles that absorb and scatter radiation. The scattering is according to the phase function  $(a)\Phi = 1$  (isotropic scattering),  $(b)\Phi = 1 + A_{1}\cos \Theta$  (linear anisotropic scattering,  $A_{1}$  is a constant), and  $(c)\Phi = \frac{3}{4} (1 + \cos^2\Theta)$  (Rayleigh scattering), where  $\Theta$  is the angle between incoming and scattered directions. A laser beam hits the column normal to  $\delta A$ . What is the transmitted fraction of the laser power? What fraction of the laser flux goes through an infinite plane at  $L$  normal to the gas column? What fraction goes back through a plane at  $0$ ? What happens to the rest?

10.14 Repeat Example 10.2 for  $(a)\Phi = 1 + A_{1}\cos \Theta$  (linear anisotropic scattering,  $A_{1} = \mathrm{const}$ ), and  $(b)\Phi = \frac{3}{4} (1 + \cos^2\Theta)$  (Rayleigh scattering), and  $\Theta$  is the angle between incoming and scattered directions.

10.15 Show that, by setting  $\beta_{\eta} = 0$  and  $I_{w} = J / \pi$ , the radiosity integral equation (5.25) can be recovered from equation (10.69) for a nonparticipating medium surrounded by diffusely reflecting walls. Hint: Break up the heat flux in equation (10.69) into two parts, incoming radiation  $H$  and exiting radiation  $J$ . For the latter assume  $\mathbf{r}$  to be an infinitesimal distance above the surface and evaluate the integral in equation (10.69).

# CHAPTER 11

# RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF MOLECULAR GASES

# 11.1 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES

Radiative transfer characteristics of an opaque wall can often be described with good accuracy by the very simple model of gray and diffuse emission, absorption, and reflection. The radiative properties of a molecular gas, on the other hand, vary so strongly and rapidly across the spectrum that the assumption of a "gray" gas is almost never a good one [1]. In the present chapter a short development of the radiative properties of molecular gases is given. Other elaborate discussions can be found, for example, in the book by Goody and Yung [2], in the monograph by Tien [3], and in the very recent treatise of Taine and Soufiani [4].

Most of the earlier work was not in the area of heat transfer but rather was carried out by astronomers, who had to deal with light absorption within Earth's atmosphere, and by astrophysicists, who studied the spectra of stars. The study of atmospheric radiation was apparently initiated by Lord Rayleigh [5] and Langley [6] in the late nineteenth century. The radiation spectra of stars started to receive attention in the early twentieth century, for example by Eddington [7] and Chandrasekhar [8,9]. The earliest measurements of radiation from hot gases were reported by Paschen, a physicist, in 1894 [10], but his work was apparently ignored by heat transfer engineers for many years [11].

The last few decades have seen much progress in the understanding of molecular gas radiation, in particular the radiation from water vapor and carbon dioxide, which is of great importance in the combustion of hydrocarbon fuels, and which also dominates atmospheric radiation with its thermodynamic implications on Earth's atmosphere. The combination of the two, i.e., the man- made strong increases in the atmosphere's  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  content, giving rise to "global warming," is perhaps the most pressing problem facing mankind today. Much of the pioneering work since the late 1920s was done by Hottel and coworkers [12- 19] (measurements and practical calculations) and by Penner [20] and Plass [21, 22] (theoretical basis).

When a photon (or an electromagnetic wave) interacts with a gas molecule, it may be either absorbed, raising the molecule's energy level, or scattered, changing the direction of travel of the photon. Conversely, a gas molecule may spontaneously lower its energy level by the emission of an appropriate photon. As will be seen in the next chapter on particle properties (since every molecule is, of course, a very small particle), the scattering of photons by molecules is always negligible for heat transfer applications. There are three different types of radiative transitions that lead to a change of molecular energy level by emission or absorption of a photon: (i) transitions between nondissociated ("bound") atomic or molecular states, called bound- bound transitions, (ii) transitions from a "bound" state to a "free" (dissociated) one (absorption) or

from "free" to "bound" (emission), called bound- free transitions, and (iii) transitions between two different "free" states, free- free transitions.

The internal energy of every atom and molecule depends on a number of factors, primarily on the energies associated with electrons spinning at varying distances around the nucleus, atoms within a molecule spinning around one another, and atoms within a molecule vibrating against each other. Quantum mechanics postulates that the energy levels for atomic or molecular electron orbit as well as the energy levels for molecular rotation and vibration are quantized; i.e., electron orbits and rotational and vibrational frequencies can only change by certain discrete amounts. Since the energy contained in a photon or electromagnetic wave is directly proportional to frequency, quantization means that, in bound- bound transitions, photons must have a certain frequency (or wavelength) in order to be captured or released, resulting in discrete spectral lines for absorption and emission. Since, according to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, the energy level of an atom or molecule cannot be fixed precisely, this phenomenon (and, as we shall see, some others as well) results in a slight broadening of these spectral lines.

Changing the orbit of an electron requires a relatively large amount of energy, or a high- frequency photon, resulting in absorption- emission lines at short wavelengths between the ultraviolet and the near- infrared (between  $10^{- 2}\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $1.5\mu \mathrm{m}$ ). Vibrational energy level changes require somewhat less energy, so that their spectral lines are found in the infrared (between  $1.5\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$ ), while changes in rotational energy levels call for the least amount of energy and, thus, rotational lines are found in the far infrared (beyond  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$ ). Changes in vibrational energy levels may (and often must) be accompanied by rotational transitions, leading to closely spaced groups of spectral lines that, as a result of line broadening, may partly overlap and lead to so- called vibration- rotation bands in the infrared. Similarly, electronic transitions in molecules (as opposed to atoms) are always accompanied by vibrational and rotational energy changes, generally in the ultraviolet to the near- infrared.

If the initial energy level of a molecule is very high (e.g., in very high- temperature gases), then the absorption of a photon may cause the breaking- away of an electron or the breakup of the entire molecule because of too strong vibration, i.e., a bound- free transition. The postabsorption energy level of the molecule depends on the kinetic energy of the separated part, which is essentially not quantized. Therefore, bound- free transitions result in a continuous absorption spectrum over all wavelengths or frequencies for which the photon energy exceeds the required ionization or dissociation energy. The same is true for the reverse process, emission of a photon in a free- bound transition (often called radiative combination).

In an ionized gas free electrons can interact with the electric field of ions resulting in a free- free transition (also known as Bremsstrahlung, which is German for brake radiation); i.e., the release of a photon lowers the kinetic energy of the electron (decelerates it), or the capture of a photon accelerates it (inverse Bremsstrahlung). Since kinetic energy levels of electrons are essentially not quantized, these photons may have any frequency or wavelength.

Bound- free and free- free transitions generally occur at very high temperatures (when dissociation and ionization become substantial). The continuum radiation associated with them is usually found at short wavelengths (ultraviolet to visible). Therefore, these effects are of importance only in extremely high- temperature situations. Most engineering applications occur at moderate temperature levels, with little ionization and dissociation, making bound- bound transitions most important. At combustion temperatures the emissive power has its maximum in the infrared (between  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $6\mu \mathrm{m}$ ), giving special importance to vibration- rotation bands. In this book we will focus our discussion on the most important case of bound- bound transitions.

# 11.2 EMISSION AND ABSORPTION PROBABILITIES

There are three different processes leading to the release or capture of a photon, namely, spontaneous emission, induced or stimulated emission (also called negative absorption), and absorption. The

absorption and emission coefficients associated with these transitions may, at least theoretically, be calculated from quantum mechanics. Complete descriptions of the microscopic phenomena may be found in books on statistical mechanics [23,24] or spectroscopy [25,26]. An informative (rather than precise) synopsis has been given by Tien [3] that we shall essentially follow here.

Let there be  $n_u$  atoms or molecules (per unit volume) at a nondegenerate higher energy state  $u$  and  $n_l$  at a lower energy state  $l$ . "Nondegenerate" means that, if there are several states with identical energies (degeneracy), each state is counted separately. The difference of energy between the two states is  $h\nu$ . The number of transitions from state  $u$  to state  $l$  by release of a photon with energy  $h\nu$  (spontaneous emission) must be proportional to the number of atoms or molecules at that level. Thus

$$
\left(\frac{dn_u}{dt}\right)_{u\to l} = -A_{ul}n_u, \tag{11.1}
$$

where the proportionality constant  $A_{ul}$  is known as the Einstein coefficient for spontaneous emission. Spontaneous emission is isotropic, meaning that the direction of the emitted photon is random, resulting in equal emission intensity in all directions. Quantum mechanics postulates that, in addition to spontaneous emission, incoming radiative intensity (or photon streams) with the appropriate frequency may induce the molecule to emit photons into the same direction as the incoming intensity (stimulated emission). Therefore, the total number of transitions from state  $u$  to state  $l$  may be written as

$$
\left(\frac{dn_u}{dt}\right)_{u\to l} = -n_u\left(A_{ul} + B_{ul}\int_{4\pi}I_\nu d\Omega\right), \tag{11.2}
$$

where  $I_{\nu}$  is the incoming intensity, which must be integrated over all directions to account for all possible transitions, and  $B_{ul}$  is the Einstein coefficient for stimulated emission. Finally, part of the incoming radiative intensity may be absorbed by molecules at energy state  $l$ . Obviously, the absorption rate will be proportional to the strength of incoming radiation as well as the number of molecules that are at energy state  $l$ , leading to

$$
\left(\frac{dn_l}{dt}\right)_{l\to u} = n_lB_{lu}\int_{4\pi}I_\nu d\Omega , \tag{11.3}
$$

where  $B_{lu}$  is the Einstein coefficient for absorption. The three Einstein coefficients may be related to one another by considering the special case of equilibrium radiation. Equilibrium radiation occurs in an isothermal black enclosure, where the radiative intensity is everywhere equal to the blackbody intensity  $I_{b\nu}$  and where the average number of molecules at any given energy level is constant at any given time, i.e., the number of transitions from all upper energy levels  $u$  to all lower states  $l$  is equal to the ones from  $l$  to  $u$ , or

$$
g_{u}\left(\frac{dn_{u}}{dt}\right)_{u\to l} + g_{l}\left(\frac{dn_{l}}{dt}\right)_{l\to u} = -g_{u}n_{u}\left(A_{ul} + B_{ul}\int_{4\pi}I_{b\nu}d\Omega\right) + g_{l}n_{l}B_{lu}\int_{4\pi}I_{b\nu}d\Omega = 0, \tag{11.4}
$$

where  $g_{u}$  and  $g_{l}$  are the degeneracies of the upper and lower energy state, respectively, i.e., the number of different arrangements with which a molecule can obtain this energy level. At local thermodynamic equilibrium the number of particles at any energy level is governed by Boltzmann's distribution law [23], leading to

$$
n_{l} / n_{u} = e^{-E_{l} / kT} / e^{-E_{u} / kT} = e^{j_{\nu} / kT}, \tag{11.5}
$$

where  $E_{u}$  and  $E_{l}$  are the energy levels associated with states  $u$  and  $l$ , respectively. Thus, the blackbody intensity may be evaluated from equation (11.4) as

$$
I_{b\nu} = \frac{1}{4\pi}\frac{A_{ul} / B_{ul}}{(g_lB_{lu} / g_uB_{ul})e^{j_{\nu} / kT} - 1}. \tag{11.6}
$$

Comparison with Planck's law, equation (1.9), shows that all three Einstein coefficients are dependent upon another, namely,

$$
A_{ul} = \frac{8\pi h\nu^3}{c_0^2} B_{ul},g_uB_{ul} = g_lB_{lu}. \tag{11.7}
$$

The Einstein coefficients are universal functions for a given transition and, therefore, the relationships between them hold also if local thermodynamic equilibrium does not prevail (i.e., the energy level populations do not obey Boltzmann's distribution, equation (11.5).

The one remaining independent Einstein coefficient is clearly an indicator of how strongly a gas is able to emit and absorb radiation. This is most easily seen by examining the number of induced transitions (by absorption and emission) in a single direction (or within a thin pencil of rays). If

$$
\frac{d}{d\Omega}\bigg(g\frac{dn}{dt}\bigg)_{l\mapsto u} = (g_in_lB_{lu} - g_un_uB_{ul})I_\nu \tag{11.8}
$$

is the net number of photons removed from the pencil of rays per unit time and per unit volume, then- - since each photon carries the energy  $h\nu$  the change of radiative energy per unit time, per unit area and distance, and per unit solid angle is

$$
-h\nu \frac{d}{d\Omega}\bigg(g\frac{dn}{dt}\bigg)_{l\mapsto u} = -(g_in_lB_{lu} - g_un_uB_{ul})h\nu I_\nu . \tag{11.9}
$$

This relation is equivalent to equation (10.1), except that in reality the spectral line associated with a transition between an upper energy state  $u$  and a lower energy state  $l$  is "broadened," i.e., transitions occur across a (very small) range of frequencies, and equation (11.9) captures all of these transitions. Accounting for this slight spread in frequencies (and recalling the definition of intensity, Section 1.6), we have

$$
\frac{d}{ds}\int_{\Delta \nu}I_{\nu}d\nu = -(g_in_lB_{lu} - g_un_uB_{ul})h\nu I_{\nu} = -\int_{\Delta \nu}(g_in_lB_{lu}' - g_un_uB_{ul}')h\nu I_{\nu}d\nu , \tag{11.10}
$$

i.e., the Einstein probabilities are not defined for a single transition frequency, but rather are spread over a small but finite frequency range  $\Delta \nu$  due to broadening, with [27]

$$
A_{ul}^{\prime} = A_{ul}\phi_{\nu},B_{ul}^{\prime} = B_{ul}\phi_{\nu},B_{lu}^{\prime} = B_{lu}\phi_{\nu}, \tag{11.11}
$$

and  $\phi_{\nu}(\nu)$  is a normalized line shape function (assumed here to be equal for all three probabilities),

$$
\int_{\Delta \nu}\phi_{\nu}(\nu)d\nu = 1. \tag{11.12}
$$

The exact shape of line broadening will be discussed in detail in Section 11.4. Using equation (11.11) we can rewrite equation (11.10) as

$$
\frac{d}{ds}\int_{\Delta \nu}I_{\nu}d\nu = -(g_in_lB_{lu} - g_un_uB_{ul})\int_{\Delta \nu}h\nu \phi_{\nu}I_{\nu}d\nu . \tag{11.13}
$$

This relation gives the absorption of an entire line, and we define the line strength or line intensity as

$$
S_{\nu} = (g_in_lB_{lu} - g_un_uB_{ul})\int_{\Delta \nu}h\nu \phi_{\nu}d\nu = (g_in_lB_{lu} - g_un_uB_{ul})h\nu . \tag{11.14}
$$

In the last expression of equation (11.14) the (line- center) frequency has been taken out of the integral, since  $\nu$  varies very little across a narrow spectral line. By the definition of the absorption

coefficient the line strength is the (linear) absorption coefficient integrated across a line. On a spectral basis across  $\Delta \nu$ , this becomes

$$
S_{\nu} = \int_{\Delta \nu}\kappa_{\nu}d\nu ,\quad \mathrm{and}\quad \kappa_{\nu} = S_{\nu}\phi_{\nu}, \tag{11.15}
$$

so that

$$
\frac{dI_{\nu}}{ds} = -\kappa_{\nu}I_{\nu}, \tag{11.16}
$$

which is, of course, identical to equation (10.1). The absorption coefficient as defined here is often termed the effective absorption coefficient since it incorporates stimulated emission (or negative absorption). Sometimes a true absorption coefficient is defined from

$$
\int_{\Delta \nu}\kappa_{\nu}d\nu = g_{l}n_{l}B_{lu}h\nu . \tag{11.17}
$$

Since stimulated emission and absorption always occur together and cannot be separated, it is general practice to incorporate stimulated emission into the absorption coefficient, so that only the effective absorption coefficient needs to be considered. Examination of equation (11.14) shows that the absorption coefficient is proportional to molecular number density. Therefore, as mentioned earlier, a number of researchers take the number density out of the definition for  $\kappa_{\nu}$  either in the form of density or pressure, by defining a mass absorption coefficient or a pressure absorption coefficient, respectively, as

$$
\kappa_{\rho \nu}\equiv \frac{\kappa_{\nu}}{\rho},\quad \kappa_{\rho \nu}\equiv \frac{\kappa_{\nu}}{p}, \tag{11.18}
$$

and similarly for  $S_{\nu}$ . If a mass or pressure absorption coefficient is used, then a  $\rho$  or  $p$  must, of course, be added to equation (11.16).

The negative of equation (11.1) gives the rate at which molecules emit photons of strength  $h\nu$  randomly into all directions (into a solid angle of  $4\pi$ ) and per unit volume. Thus, multiplying this equation by  $- h\nu$  and dividing by  $4\pi$  gives isotropic energy emitted per unit time, per unit solid angle, per unit area and distance along a pencil of rays or, in short, the change of intensity per unit distance due to spontaneous emission:

$$
\frac{d}{ds}\int_{\Delta \nu}I_{\nu}d\nu = -h\nu \frac{d}{d\Omega}\left(\frac{dn}{dt}\right)_{u\to l} = g_{u}n_{u}A_{ul}h\nu /4\pi . \tag{11.19}
$$

This is the emission of an entire line and, on a spectral basis across  $\Delta \nu$  this becomes

$$
\frac{dI_{\nu}}{ds} = g_{u}n_{u}A_{ul}^{\prime}h\nu /4\pi = j_{\nu}, \tag{11.20}
$$

and  $j_{\nu}$  is called the emission coefficient, which is related to the absorption coefficient through equations (11.7), (11.14), and (11.15), leading to

$$
j_{\nu} = \kappa_{\nu}\frac{2h\nu^{3}}{c_{0}^{2}}\frac{n_{u}}{n_{l} - n_{u}}, \tag{11.21}
$$

At local thermodynamic equilibrium energy levels are populated according to Boltzmann's distribution, equation (11.5), and the emission coefficient and equation (11.20) reduce to

$$
\frac{dI_{\nu}}{ds} = j_{\nu} = \kappa_{\nu}I_{b\nu}, \tag{11.22}
$$

which represents the augmentation of directional intensity due to spontaneous emission, as given by equation (10.10).

# 11.3 ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR SPECTRA

We have already seen that the emission or absorption of a photon goes hand in hand with the change of rotational and/or vibrational energy levels in molecules, or with the change of electron orbits (in atoms and molecules). This change, in turn, causes a change in radiative intensity resulting in spectral lines. In this section we discuss briefly how the position of spectral lines within a vibration- rotation band can be calculated, since it is these bands that are of great importance to the heat transfer engineer. More detailed information as well as discussion of electronic spectra, and bound- free and free- free transitions may be found in more specialized books on quantum mechanics [24, 25, 28] or spectroscopy [26, 29- 31], in the book on atmospheric radiation by Goody and Yung [2], or in the monographs on gas radiation properties by Tien [3] and Taine and Soufiani [4].

Since every particle moves in three- dimensional space, it has three degrees of freedom: It can move in the forward- backward, left- right, and/or upward- downward directions. If two or more particles are connected with each other (diatomic and polyatomic molecules), then each of the atoms making up the molecule has three degrees of freedom. However, it is more convenient to say that a molecule consisting of  $N$  atoms has three degrees of freedom for translation, and  $3N - 3$  degrees of freedom for relative motion between atoms. These  $3N - 3$  degrees of internal freedom may be further separated into rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom. This fact is illustrated in Fig. 11- 1 for a diatomic molecule and for linear and nonlinear triatomic molecules. The diatomic molecule has three internal degrees of freedom. Obviously, it can rotate around its center of gravity within the plane of the paper or, similarly, perpendicularly to the paper (with the rotation axis lying in the paper). It could also rotate around its own axis; however, neither one of the atoms would move (except for rotating around itself). Thus, the last degree of freedom must be used for vibrational motion between the two atoms as indicated in the figure. The situation gets rapidly more complicated for molecules with increasing number of atoms. For linear triatomic molecules (e.g.,  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ ,  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$ ,  $\mathrm{HCN}$ ) there are, again, only two rotational modes. Since there are six internal degrees of freedom, there are four vibrational modes, as indicated in Fig. 11- 1. However, two of these vibrational modes are identical, or degenerate (except for taking place in perpendicular planes). In contrast, a nonlinear triatomic molecule has three rotational modes: In this case rotation around the horizontal axis in the plane of the paper is legitimate, so that there are only three vibrational degrees of freedom. Depending on the axis of rotation, a polyatomic molecule may have different moments of inertia for each of the three rotational modes. If symmetry is such that all three moments of inertia are the same, the molecule is classified as a spherical top (e.g.,  $\mathrm{CH_4}$ ). It is called a symmetric top, if two are the same (e.g.,  $\mathrm{NH_3}$ ,  $\mathrm{CH_3Cl}$ ,  $\mathrm{C_2H_6}$ ,  $\mathrm{SF_6}$ ), and an asymmetric top, if all three are different (e.g.,  $\mathrm{H_2O}$ ,  $\mathrm{O_3}$ ,  $\mathrm{SO_2}$ ,  $\mathrm{NO_2}$ ,  $\mathrm{H_2S}$ ,  $\mathrm{H_2O_2}$ ).

# Rotational Transitions

To calculate the allowed rotational energy level from quantum mechanics using Schrödinger's wave equation (see, for example, [23,24]), we generally assume that the molecule consists of point

![](images/ce754e582ccd096ceb03f9430de656ee5df49551b8e102ad288196566f1852c6.jpg)  
FIGURE 11-1 Rotational and vibrational degrees of freedom for (a) diatomic, (b) linear triatomic, and (c) nonlinear triatomic molecules.

masses connected by rigid massless rods, the so- called rigid rotator model. The solution to this wave equation dictates that possible energy levels for a linear molecule are limited to

$$
E_{j} = \frac{\hbar^{2}}{2I} j(j + 1) = hc_{0}Bj(j + 1),\quad j = 0,1,2,\ldots (j\mathrm{integer}), \tag{11.23}
$$

where  $\hbar = h / 2\pi$  is the modified Planck's constant,  $I$  is the moment of inertia of the molecule,  $j$  is the rotational quantum number, and the abbreviation  $B$  has been introduced for later convenience. Allowed transitions are  $\Delta j = \pm 1$  and 0 (the latter being of importance for a simultaneous vibrational transition); this expression is known as the selection rule. In the case of the absorption of a photon  $(j\rightarrow j + 1$  transition) the wavenumbers of the resulting spectral lines can then be determined as

$$
\begin{array}{r l r} & {} & {\eta = (E_{j + 1} - E_{j}) / h c_{0} = B(j + 1)(j + 2) - B j(j + 1)}\\ & {} & {= 2B(j + 1),\qquad j = 0,1,2,\ldots .} \end{array} \tag{11.24}
$$

The results of this equation produce a number of equidistant spectral lines (in units of wavenumber or frequency), as shown in the sketch of Fig. 11- 2.

The rigid rotator model turns out to be surprisingly accurate, although for high rotation rates  $(j\gg 0)$  a small correction factor due to the centrifugal contribution (stretching of the "rod") may be considered. Not all linear molecules exhibit rotational lines, since an electric dipole moment is required for a transition to occur. Thus, diatomic molecules such as  $\mathrm{O_2}$  and  $\mathrm{N}_2$  never undergo rotational transitions, while symmetric molecules such as  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  show a rotational spectrum only if accompanied by a vibrational transition [3]. Evaluation of the spectral lines of nonlinear polyatomic molecules is always rather complicated and the reader is referred to specialized treatises such as the one by Herzberg [30].

# Vibrational Transitions

The simplest model of a vibrating diatomic molecule assumes two point masses connected by a perfectly elastic massless spring. Such a model leads to a harmonic oscillation and is, therefore, called the harmonic oscillator. For this case the solution to Schrodinger's wave equation for the determination of possible vibrational energy levels is readily found to be

$$
E_{v} = h\nu_{e}(v + \textstyle \frac{1}{2}),\quad v = 0,1,2,\ldots (v\mathrm{integer}), \tag{11.25}
$$

where  $\nu_{e}$  is the equilibrium frequency of harmonic oscillation or eigenfrequency, and  $v$  is the vibrational quantum number. The selection rule for a harmonic oscillator is  $\Delta v = \pm 1$  and, thus, one would expect a single spectral line at the same frequency as the harmonic oscillation, or at a wavenumber

$$
\eta = (E_{v + 1} - E_v) / hc_0 = (\nu_e / c_0)(v + 1 - v) = \nu_e / c_0, \tag{11.26}
$$

as indicated in Fig. 11- 3. Unfortunately, the assumption of a harmonic oscillator leads to considerably less accurate results than the one of a rigid rotator. This fact is easily appreciated by looking at Fig. 11- 4, which depicts the molecular energy level of a diatomic molecule vs. interatomic distance: When atoms move toward each other repulsive forces grow more and more rapidly, while the opposite is true when the atoms move apart. The heavy line in Fig. 11- 4 shows the minimum and maximum distances between atoms for any given vibrational energy state

(showing also that the molecule may dissociate if the energy level becomes too high). In a perfectly elastic spring, force increases linearly with displacement, leading to a symmetric quadratic polynomial for the displacement limits as also indicated in the figure. If a more complicated spring constant is included in the analysis, this results in additional terms in equation (11.25); and the selection rule changes to  $\Delta v = \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \ldots$ , producing several approximately equally spaced spectral lines. The transition corresponding to  $\Delta v = \pm 1$  is called the fundamental, or the first harmonic, and usually is by far the strongest one. The transition corresponding to  $\Delta v = \pm 2$  is called the first overtone or second harmonic, and so on. For example, CO has a strong fundamental band at  $\eta_0 = 2143 \mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  and a much weaker first overtone band at  $\eta_0 = 4260 \mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  (see the data in Table 11.3 in Section 11.10).

In the literature the vibrational state of a molecule is identified by the values of the vibrational quantum numbers. For example, the vibrational state of a nonlinear, triatomic molecule, such as  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ , with its three different vibrational modes, is identified as  $(v_1v_2v_3)$ . The case is a little bit more complicated for molecules with degeneracies. For example, the linear  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  molecule has three different vibrational modes, the second one being doubly degenerate (see Fig. 11- 1); its vibrational state is defined by  $(v_1v_2^1 v_3)$  or  $(v_1v_2v_3)$ , where  $0 \leq l_2 \leq v_2$  is an angular momentum quantum number, describing the rotation of the molecule caused by different vibrations in perpendicular planes. More details on these issues are given by Taine and Soufiani [4] and by Herzberg [30].

# Combined Vibrational-Rotational Transitions

Since the energy required to change the vibrational state is so much larger than that needed for rotational changes, and since both transitions can (and indeed often must) occur simultaneously, this requirement leads to many closely spaced lines, also called a vibration- rotation band, centered around the wavenumber  $\eta = \nu_e / c_0$ , which is known as the band origin or band center.

For the simplest model of a rigid rotator combined with a harmonic oscillator, assuming both modes to be independent, the combined energy level at quantum numbers  $j, v$  is given by

$$
\begin{array}{r}E_{vj} = h\nu_{e}(v + \frac{1}{2}) + B_{v}j(j + 1),\quad v,j = 0,1,2,\ldots . \end{array} \tag{11.27}
$$

Since the small error due to the assumption of a totally rigid rotator can result in appreciable total error when a large collection of simultaneous vibration- rotation transition is considered, allowance has been made in the above expression for the fact that  $B_{v}$  (or the molecular moment of inertia) may depend on the vibrational energy level. The allowed transitions  $(\Delta v = \pm 1$  combined with  $\Delta j = \pm 1,0)$  lead to three separate branches of the band, namely  $P(\Delta j = - 1)$ ,  $Q$

![](images/79a9b8acd84fe6295ca1f02cbdf8380ff21392edaf5a9715a0a3f4920ab6e462.jpg)

$$

where  $j$  is the rotational state before the transition. It is seen that there is no line at the band origin. If  $B_{v + 1} = B_{v} =$  const, then the  $Q$  - branch vanishes and the two remaining branches yield equally spaced lines on both sides of the band center. If  $B_{v + 1}< B_{v}$  (larger moment of inertia  $I$  at higher vibrational level), then the  $R$  - branch will, for sufficiently large  $j,$  fold back toward and beyond the band origin. In that case all lines within the band are on one side of a limiting wavenumber. Those bands, where this occurs close to the band center (i.e., for small  $j$  where the line strength is strong), are known as bands with a head. A sketch of a typical vibration- rotation band spectrum is shown in Fig. 11- 5. Note that in linear molecules the  $Q$  - branch often does not occur as a result of forbidden transitions [3]. Many more complicated combined transitions are possible, since every molecule has a number of rotational and vibrational energy modes, any number of which could undergo a transition simultaneously. An example is given in Fig. 11- 6, which shows a calculated spectrum of the  $4.3\mu \mathrm{m}\mathrm{CO}_2$  band (a collection of many different vibrational transitions together with their rotational lines), generated from the HITRAN database [32]. It is apparent that this band has no  $Q$  - branch.

# Electronic Transitions

Electronic energy transitions, i.e., changing the orbital radius of an electron, requires a substantially larger amount of energy than vibrational and rotational transitions, with resulting photons in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum. Transitions of interest in heat transfer applications (i.e., at wavelengths above  $0.25\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) generally occur only at very high temperatures (above several thousand degrees Kelvin) and/or in the presence of large numbers of free electrons (such as fluorescent lights). At extreme temperatures atoms and molecules may also become ionized through a bound- free absorption event, or an ion and electron can recombine (free- bound emission). In addition, a free electron colliding with a molecule may absorb or emit a photon (free- free transition). If the gas is monatomic, radiation can alter only electronic energy states. Still, this results in some 914 lines for monatomic nitrogen and 682 for

monatomic oxygen [33], contributing to heat transfer in high- temperature applications, such as the air plasma in front of a hypersonic spacecraft entering Earth's atmosphere. As an example Fig. 11- 7 shows the absorption coefficient of atomic nitrogen at  $T = 10,860\mathrm{K}$ , as encountered in the shock layer of the Stardust spacecraft [34]. Many of the monatomic lines are extremely strong (with absorption coefficients near  $10^{6}\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$ ), and continuum radiation (bound- free and free- free transitions) is substantial. In this part of the spectrum otherwise radiatively inert molecules, e.g., diatomic nitrogen, also emit and absorb photons, leading to simultaneous electronic- vibration- rotation bands. For comparison, the absorption coefficient for  $\mathrm{N}_2$  is also included in Fig. 11- 7, consisting of 5 electronic bands, each containing many vibration- rotation subbands. At temperatures above  $10,000\mathrm{K}$ $\mathrm{N}_2$  is nearly completely dissociated, making its absorption coefficient small in comparison to that of monatomic  $\mathrm{N}$ . At lower temperatures, nearly all molecules are at the lowest electronic energy level, and only the bands with  $\eta >50,000\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , or  $\lambda < 0.2\mu \mathrm{m}$  remain (of no importance in most engineering applications).

# Strength of Spectral Lines within a Band

In equation (11.14) we related the spectral absorption coefficient to the Einstein coefficients  $B_{lu}$  and  $B_{ul}$  before knowing how such a transition takes place. We now want to develop equation (11.14) a little further to learn how the strength of individual lines (and, through it, the absorption coefficient) varies across vibration- rotation bands, and how they are affected by variations in temperature and pressure.

For a combined vibrational (from vibrational quantum number  $v$  to  $v\pm 1$ ) and rotational (from rotational quantum number  $j$  to  $j$  or  $j\pm 1$ ) transition, the line intensity or line strength may be rewritten in terms of wavenumber (i.e., after division by  $c_0$ ) as

$$
S_{\eta} = (n_{l}g_{l}B_{lu} - n_{u}g_{u}B_{ul})h\eta , \tag{11.29}
$$

where  $\eta$  is the associated transition wavenumber from equations (11.28). Using equations (11.5)

![](images/37ec21f021a62169d817ca69a8252e6ac64686690700641f1da27c25dde564c8.jpg)  
FIGURE 11-7 Linear spectral absorption coefficient of monatomic and diatomic nitrogen in a hypersonic boundary air plasma.

and (11.7) this becomes

$$
S_{\eta} = \frac{n_{l}g_{u}A_{ul}}{8\pi c_{0}\eta^{2}}\left(1 - e^{-hc_{0}\eta /kT}\right). \tag{11.30}
$$

The number of molecules at the lower energy state,  $n_{l}$ , may be related to the total number of particles per unit volume,  $n$ , through [23]

$$
\frac{n_l}{n} = \frac{e^{-E_l / kT}}{Q(T)},\qquad n = \frac{p}{kT}, \tag{11.31}
$$

where  $Q(T)$  is the rovibrational partition function (a summation over all the possible rotational and vibrational energy levels of the molecule). Substituting this into equation (11.30) and relating the Einstein coefficient to matrix elements of the molecule's electric dipole moment [20],  $\Re_{ul}$ , leads to

$$
S_{\eta} = \frac{8\pi^{3}\eta}{3hc_{0}k} |\Re_{ul}|^{2}\frac{p}{Q(T)T}\left(1 - e^{-hc_{0}\eta /kT}\right)e^{-E_{l} / kT}. \tag{11.32}
$$

The rovibrational partition function  $Q(T)$  and dipole elements  $|\Re_{ul}|^2$  can, at least in principle, be calculated from quantum mechanics through very lengthy and complex calculations. For example, much of Penner's book [20] is devoted to this subject.

To gain some insight into the relative strengths of lines within a vibration- rotation band, we will look at the case of a rigid rotator- harmonic oscillator, with the additional assumptions that the bandwidth is small compared with the wavenumber at the band center and that only the  $P$  and  $R$  branches are important. For such a case the evaluation of the  $|\Re_{ul}|^2$  is relatively straightforward [20], and equation (11.32) may be restated as

$$
\begin{array}{r}S_{Pj} = Cje^{-hc_0B_vj(j + 1) / kT},\qquad j = 1,2,3,\ldots \\ S_{Rj} = C(j + 1)e^{-hc_0B_vj(j + 1) / kT},\quad j = 0,1,2,\ldots \end{array} \tag{11.33b}
$$

where  $E_{rj} = hc_0B_vj(j + 1)$  is the rotational contribution to the lower energy state from equation (11.23) (i.e., before transition for absorption of a photon; after transition for emission), and  $C$  collects the coefficients in equation (11.32), as well as the vibrational contribution to the

lower energy state. Examination of equations (11.33) shows that line strength first increases linearly with increasing  $j$  (as long as  $hc_{0}B_{v}j(j + 1) / kT \ll 1$ ), levels off around  $j \simeq \sqrt{kT / hc_{0}B_{v}}$ , then drops off exponentially with large values of  $j$ . It is apparent that the band widens with temperature, and lines farther away from the band center become most important. An example is given in Fig. 11- 6 for the calculated spectrum of the  $4.3\mu \mathrm{m}$ $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  band, generated from the HITRAN database [32]. At room temperature the  $4.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band is dominated by the  $00^{0}0 \rightarrow 00^{0}1$  vibrational transition, centered at  $2349\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . It is clear that this band has no  $Q$ - branch, and that the line strengths of the  $P$ - and  $R$ - branches closely follow equation (11.33).

Temperature and pressure dependence As seen from equation (11.32) the linear line strength  $S_{\eta}$  is directly proportional to the pressure of the absorbing/emitting gas; therefore, pressure- based line strength  $S_{\eta \eta}$  and density- based line strength  $S_{\rho \eta}$  are functions of temperature only. The temperature dependence comes from three contributions:  $(i)$  from the partition function  $Q(T)$ ,  $(ii)$  from the stimulated emission term,  $\exp (- hc_{0}\eta /kT)$ , and  $(iii)$  from the lower energy state  $E_{l}$ . Evaluation of the partition function is extremely difficult, and approximations need to be made. To a good degree of accuracy rotational and vibrational contributions can be separated, i.e.,  $Q(T) \simeq Q_{v}(T)Q_{r}(T)$ . The vibrational partition function can then be determined, assuming a harmonic oscillator, as [30]

$$
Q_{v}(T) = \prod_{k}\left(1 - e^{-hc_{0}\eta_{k} / kT}\right)^{-g_{k}}, \tag{11.34}
$$

where the product is over all the different vibrational modes with their harmonic oscillation wavenumbers  $\eta_{k} = \nu_{e} / c_{0}$  in equation (11.25)], and  $g_{k}$  is the degeneracy of the vibrational mode. The rotational partition function depends on the symmetry of the molecule and on the moments of inertia for rotation around two (linear molecule) or three (nonlinear molecule) axes. For moderate to high temperatures, i.e., when  $2IkT / \hbar^2 \gg 1$  [23,30],

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathrm{Linear~molecules~}(I_r = I_y = I)\colon Q_r(T) = \frac{1}{\sigma}\frac{2IkT}{\hbar^2}\propto T,}\\ & {\mathrm{Nonlinear~molecules:}\qquad Q_r(T) = \frac{1}{\sigma}\prod_{i = x,y,z}\left(\frac{2I_i kT}{\hbar^2}\right)^{1 / 2}\propto T^{3 / 2},} \end{array} \tag{11.35b}
$$

where  $\sigma$  is a symmetry number, or the number of distinguishable rotational modes. Examining the separate contributions to the temperature dependence we note that, at moderate temperatures, the rotational partition function causes the line strength to decrease with temperature as  $1 / T$  or  $1 / T^{3 / 2}$ , while the influences of the vibrational partition function and of stimulated emission are very minor (but may become important for  $T > 1000\mathrm{K}$ ). The influence of the lower energy state  $E_{l}$  can be negligible or dramatic, depending on the size of  $E_{l}$ : for small values of  $E_{l}$  (low vibrational levels)  $\exp (- E_{l} / kT) = 1$  and further raising the temperature will not change this value. On the other hand, large values of  $E_{l}$  (associated with high vibrational levels) make line strengths very small at low temperatures, but produce sharply increasing line strengths at elevated temperatures (when more molecules populate the higher vibrational levels), giving rise to so- called "hot lines" and "hot bands." An example of the temperature dependence of the spectral absorption coefficient (including effects of line broadening and spacing) will be given in the next section, in Fig. 11- 11.

# 11.4 LINE RADIATION

In the previous two sections we have seen that quantum mechanics postulates that a molecular gas can emit or absorb photons at an infinite set of distinct wavenumbers or frequencies. We already observed that no spectral line can be truly monochromatic; rather, absorption or emission occurs over a tiny but finite range of wavenumbers. The results are broadened spectral lines that have their maxima at the wavenumber predicted by quantum mechanics. In this

section we will briefly look at line strengths, the causes of line broadening and at line shapes, i.e., the variation of line strength with wavenumber for an isolated line. More detailed accounts may be found in more specialized works [2,3, 20, 26]. The effects of line overlap, which usually occurs in vibration- rotation bands in the infrared, will be discussed in Section 11.8, "Narrow Band Models."

Numerous phenomena cause broadening of spectral lines. The four most important ones are natural line broadening, collision broadening, Stark broadening, and Doppler broadening, with collision and, to a lesser extent, Doppler broadening dominating in most engineering applications. These models have been developed for isolated lines, i.e., interaction between overlapping lines is not considered, and was found to be accurate for low- to- moderate pressures. However, at elevated pressures (roughly 10 bar) collisional interference (or line mixing) effects should be accounted for [35,36].

# Natural Line Broadening

Every excited molecule will have its energy levels decay spontaneously to a lower state by emitting a photon, even if the molecule is completely undisturbed. According to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle no energy transition can occur with precisely the same amount of energy, thus causing the energy of emitted photons to vary slightly and the spectral lines to be broadened. The mechanism of decay for that of spontaneous emission is the same as that for collision broadening as discussed in the next section, resulting in identical line shapes. However, the average time for spontaneous decay is much larger than the average time between molecular collisions. Therefore, natural line broadening is generally not important from an engineering point of view, and its effect is invariably small compared to collision broadening. Its small effect may be accounted for by adding a line half- width  $\gamma_{\mathrm{L}}$  to the collision line half- width  $\gamma_{C}$  discussed below.

# Collision Broadening

As the name indicates, collision broadening of spectral lines is attributable to the frequency of collisions between gas molecules. The shape of such a line can be calculated from the electron theory of Lorentz* or from quantum mechanics [2,37] as

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \frac{S}{\pi}\frac{\gamma_{c}}{(\eta - \eta_{0})^{2} + \gamma_{c}^{2}} = S\phi_{Ll}\big(\gamma_{c},\eta -\eta_{0}\big),\quad S\equiv \int_{\Delta \eta}\kappa_{\eta}d\eta , \tag{11.36}
$$

where  $S$  is the line- integrated absorption coefficient or line strength,  $\gamma_{c}$  is the so- called line half- width in units of wavenumber (half the line width at half the maximum absorption coefficient), and  $\eta_{0}$  is the wavenumber at the line center. The line shape function is a normalized Lorentz profile, such that

$$
\int_{\Delta \eta}\phi_{Ll}(\eta)d\eta = 1. \tag{11.37}
$$

The line shape function is not dimensionless, but has the units of reciprocal spectral variable. In equation (11.37) this is reciprocal wavenumber (or cm), since  $\eta_{\eta}$  is expressed in terms of wavenumber. The shape of a collision- broadened line is identical to that of natural line broadening, and the combined effect is generally termed Lorentz broadening with a line half- width  $\gamma_{L}$ . The spectral distribution of a Lorentz line is shown in Fig. 11- 8 (together with the shape of Doppler- and Voigt- broadened lines). Since molecular collisions are proportional to the

![](images/80f096aff2a6a0d397aaca2251a2b46e25dea523439cf15b47a6c23a55b4207b.jpg)  
FIGURE 11-8 Spectral line shape for Lorentz (collision), Doppler, and Voigt broadening (for equal line strength and half-width).

number density of molecules  $(n \propto \rho \propto p / T)$  and to the average molecular speed  $(v_{\mathrm{av}} \propto \sqrt{T})$ , it is not surprising that the half- width for a pure gas can be calculated from kinetic theory [2] as

$$
\gamma_{\mathrm{c}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\frac{D^{2}p}{c_{0}\sqrt{mkT}} = \gamma_{\mathrm{co}}\left(\frac{p}{p_{0}}\right)\left(\frac{T_{0}}{T}\right)^{n}, \tag{11.38}
$$

where  $D$  is the effective diameter of the molecule,  $m$  is its mass,  $p$  is total gas pressure,  $T$  is absolute temperature, and the subscript  $\sqrt[0]{0}$  denotes a reference state. The collisional diameter depends on the temperature of the gas and the value for the exponent  $n$  must, in general, be found from experiment. If the absorbing- emitting gas is part of a mixture, the fact that collisions involving only nonradiating gases do not cause broadening, and that the nonradiating gases have different molecular diameters, must be accounted for, and equation (11.38) must be generalized to

$$
\gamma_{\mathrm{c}} = \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}}\sum_{i}\frac{\sigma_{i}^{2}p_{i}}{c_{0}\sqrt{kT}}\left(\frac{1}{m} +\frac{1}{m_{i}}\right)^{1 / 2} = \sum_{i}\gamma_{\mathrm{co},i}\left(\frac{p_{i}}{p_{0}}\right)\left(\frac{T_{0}}{T}\right)^{n_{i}}, \tag{11.39}
$$

where  $p_i$  and  $m_i$  are partial pressure and molecular mass of the various broadening gases (including the radiating gas), respectively, and  $\sigma_{i}$  is the effective collisional diameter with species  $i$ . Temperature- dependent broadening coefficients for some absorbing gases have been tabulated by Rosenmann et al. [38]  $(\mathrm{CO}_2)$ , Delaye et al. [39]  $(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$ , and Hartmann et al. [40], all for mixtures containing  $\mathrm{N}_2$ ,  $\mathrm{O}_2$ ,  $\mathrm{CO}_2$ , and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ .

# Stark Broadening

Stark broadening occurs if the radiative transition occurs in the presence of a strong electric field. The electrical field may be externally applied, but it is most often due to an internal field, such as the presence of ions and free electrons in a high- temperature plasma. At low- enough pressures Stark broadened lines are symmetric and have Lorentzian shape, equation (11.36). Line widths depend strongly on free electron number density,  $n_e$ , and free electron temperature,

$T_{e}$ , and may be calculated as [26,41]

$$
\gamma_{s} = \gamma_{s0}\left(\frac{T_{e}}{T_{0}}\right)^{n}\left(\frac{n_{e}}{n_{0}}\right), \tag{11.40}
$$

where again the subscript  $^{\prime \prime}0^{\prime \prime}$  denotes a reference state. The Stark effect can also result in a shift in the line's spectral position.

# Doppler Broadening

According to the Doppler effect a wave traveling toward an observer appears slightly compressed (shorter wavelength or higher frequency) if the emitter is also moving toward the observer, and slightly expanded (longer wavelength or lower frequency) if the emitter is moving away. This is true whether the wave is a sound wave (for example, the pitch of a whistle of a train passing an observer) or an electromagnetic wave. Thus,

$$
\eta_{\mathrm{obs}} = \eta_{\mathrm{em}}\left(1 + \frac{\mathbf{v}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}}}{c}\right), \tag{11.41}
$$

where  $\mathbf{v}$  is the velocity of the emitter and  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  is a unit vector pointing from the emitter to the observer. Assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium, so that Maxwell's velocity distribution applies, the probability for a relative velocity  $v = \mathbf{v}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}$  between an emitting/absorbing molecule and an observer is

$$
p(v) = \left(\frac{m}{2\pi kT}\right)^{1 / 2}\exp \left(-\frac{mv^2}{2kT}\right), \tag{11.42}
$$

where  $m$  is the mass of the radiating molecule. For small  $v$  this leads to a Doppler shift in observed wavenumber of

$$
\eta -\eta_0 = \eta_0\frac{v}{c}. \tag{11.43}
$$

Substituting equation (11.43) into (11.42) one can calculate the line profile as [20]

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = S\phi_{D\eta}(\gamma_{D},\eta -\eta_{0}) = S\frac{\sqrt{\ln 2}}{\gamma_{D}\sqrt{\pi}}\exp \left[-(\ln 2)\left(\frac{\eta - \eta_{0}}{\gamma_{D}}\right)^{2}\right], \tag{11.44}
$$

where  $\gamma_{D}$  is the Doppler line half- width, given by

$$
\gamma_{D} = \frac{\eta_{0}}{c_{0}}\sqrt{\frac{2kT}{m}\ln 2}. \tag{11.45}
$$

Note that, unlike during collision and natural line broadening, the Doppler line width depends on its spectral position. The different line shapes are compared in Fig. 11- 8. For equal overall strength, the Doppler line is much more concentrated near the line center.

# Combined Effects

In most engineering applications collision broadening, which is proportional to  $p / \sqrt{T}$ , is by far the most important broadening mechanism. Only at very high temperatures (when, owing to the distribution of the Planck function, transitions at large  $\eta$  are most important; and/or through the opposing temperature dependencies of  $\gamma_{L}$  and  $\gamma_{D}$ ) and/or low pressures may Doppler broadening, with its proportionality to  $\eta \sqrt{T}$ , become dominant. Figure 11- 9 shows typical line half- widths for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and water vapor in their  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  bands as a function of temperature. It is seen that at low pressures  $(p = 0.1$  bar) Doppler broadening always dominates. At higher pressures  $(p\geq 1$  bar) collision broadening dominates, unless extremely high temperatures  $(T > 2000\mathrm{K})$

FIGURE 11-9 Lorentz and Doppler line half-widths for the  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  bands of  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ .

are encountered. Even then the lines retain their Lorentz shape in the all- important line wings (since in gas columns line centers tend to be opaque, regardless of line shape, radiative behavior is usually governed by the strengths of the line wings). A study by Wang and Modest [42] quantifies the conditions under which combined pressure- Doppler broadening must be considered. Combined broadening behavior is also encountered in low- pressure plasmas, where both Doppler and Stark broadening can be substantial, especially for monatomic gases.

If combined effects need to be considered, it is customary to assume collision and Doppler broadening to be independent of one another (which is not strictly correct). In that case a collision- broadened line would be displaced by the Doppler shift, equation (11.43), and averaged over its probability, equation (11.42). This leads to the Voigt profile [2],

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \frac{S\gamma_{L}}{\pi^{3 / 2}}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{e^{-x^{2}}dx}{\left(\eta - \eta_{0} - \frac{xy_{D}}{\sqrt{\ln 2}}\right)^{2} + \gamma_{L}^{2}},x = v\sqrt{\frac{m}{2kT}}. \tag{11.46}
$$

No closed- form solution exists for the Voigt profile. It has been tabulated in the meteorological literature in terms of the parameter  $2\gamma_{L} / \gamma_{D}$ . How the shape of the Voigt profile changes from pure Doppler broadening  $(\gamma_{L} / \gamma_{D} = 0)$  to pure collision broadening  $(\gamma_{L} / \gamma_{D}\rightarrow \infty)$  is also shown in Fig. 11- 8 (for constant line half- widths). Several fast algorithms for the calculation of the Voigt profile have also been reported [43- 46]. A Fortran subroutine voigt is given in Appendix F, that calculates the Voigt  $\kappa_{\eta}$  as a function of  $S$ ,  $\gamma_{L}$ ,  $\gamma_{D}$ , and  $|\eta | - |\eta_{0}|$  based on the Humil'ck algorithm [46].

Example 11.1. The half- width of a certain spectral line of a certain gas has been measured to be  $0.05\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  at room temperature (300K) and 1 atm. When the line half- width is measured at 1 atm and  $3000\mathrm{K}$ , it turns out that the width has remained unchanged. Estimate the contributions of Doppler and collision broadening in both cases.

# Solution

As a first approximation we assume that the widths of both contributions may be added to give the total line half- width (this is a fairly good approximation if one makes a substantially larger contribution than the other). Therefore, we may estimate

$$
\gamma_{\mathrm{cl}} + \gamma_{\mathrm{dl}}\approx \gamma_{1} = \gamma_{2}\approx \gamma_{\mathrm{c2}} + \gamma_{\mathrm{b2}}
$$

and, from equations (11.38) and (11.45),

$$
\frac{\gamma_{c2}}{\gamma_{c1}} = \sqrt{\frac{T_1}{T_2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}},\quad \frac{\gamma_{d2}}{\gamma_{d1}} = \sqrt{\frac{T_2}{T_1}} = \sqrt{10}.
$$

Eliminating the Doppler widths from these equations we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{c}\gamma_2 = \frac{\gamma_{c_1}}{\sqrt{10}} +\sqrt{10}\gamma_{d_1} = \frac{\gamma_{c_1}}{\sqrt{10}} +\sqrt{10} (\gamma_1 - \gamma_{c_1}),\\ \displaystyle \frac{\gamma_{c_1}}{\gamma_1} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{9}\left(\sqrt{10} -\frac{\gamma_2}{\gamma_1}\right) = 0.76, \end{array}
$$

and

$$
\frac{\gamma_{c2}}{\gamma_2} = \frac{1}{9}\left(\sqrt{10}\frac{\gamma_1}{\gamma_2} -1\right) = 0.24.
$$

We see that at room temperature, collision broadening is about three times stronger than Doppler broadening, while exactly the reverse is true at  $3000\mathrm{K}$

# Radiation from Isolated Lines

Combining equations (11.16) and (11.22) gives the complete equation of transfer for an absorbing- emitting (but not scattering) medium,

$$
\frac{dI_{\eta}}{ds} = \kappa_{\eta}(I_{b\eta} - I_{\eta}), \tag{11.47}
$$

where the first term of the right- hand side represents augmentation due to emission and the second term is attenuation due to absorption. Let us assume we have a layer of an isothermal and homogeneous gas of thickness  $L$ . Then neither  $I_{b\eta}$  nor  $\kappa_{\eta}$  is a function of location and the solution to the equation of transfer is

$$
I_{\eta}(X) = I_{\eta}(0)e^{-\kappa_{\eta}X} + I_{b\eta}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}X}\right), \tag{11.48}
$$

where the optical path length  $X$  is equal to  $L$  if a linear absorption coefficient is used (geometric path length), or equal to  $L$  multiplied by partial density (density path length) or pressure (pressure path length) of the radiating gas if either mass or pressure absorption coefficient is used. Thus, the difference between entering and exiting intensity, integrated over the entire spectral line, is

$$
I(X) - I(0) = \int_{\Delta \eta}[I_{\eta}(X) - I_{\eta}(0)]d\eta \approx [I_{b\eta} - I_{\eta}(0)]\int_{\Delta \eta}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}X}\right)d\eta , \tag{11.49}
$$

where the assumption has been used that neither incoming nor blackbody intensity can vary appreciably over the width of a single spectral line. The integrand of the factor

$$
W = \int_{\Delta \eta}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}X}\right)d\eta \tag{11.50}
$$

is the fraction of incoming radiation absorbed by the gas layer at any given wavenumber, and it is also the fraction of the total emitted radiation that escapes from the layer (not undergoing self- absorption).  $W$  is commonly called the equivalent line width since a line of width  $W$  with infinite absorption coefficient would have the identical effect on absorption and emission; the dependence of the increase of  $W$  with increasing optical path  $X$  is sometimes called the curve of growth. The equivalent line width for a Lorentz line may be evaluated by substituting equation (11.36) into equation (11.50) to yield

$$
W = 2\pi \gamma_{L}x e^{-x}[I_{0}(x) + I_{1}(x)] = 2\pi \gamma_{L}L(x), \tag{11.51}
$$

where

$$
\gamma_{L}\equiv \gamma_{C} + \gamma_{N},\qquad x\equiv SX / 2\pi \gamma_{L}, \tag{11.52}
$$

the  $I_{0}$  and  $I_{1}$  are modified Bessel functions, and  $L(x)$  is called the Ladenburg- Reiche function, after the authors who originally developed it [47]. For simpler evaluation, equation (11.51) may be approximated as reported by [2] as

$$
L(x)\simeq x\left[1 + \left(\frac{\pi x}{2}\right)^{5 / 4}\right]^{-2 / 5}, \tag{11.53}
$$

with a maximum error of approximately  $1\%$  near  $x = 1$ . Asymptotic values for  $W$  are easily obtained as

$$
\begin{array}{ll}{W=SX,}&{x\ll 1,}\\{W=2\sqrt{SX\gamma_{L}},}&{x\gg 1.}\end{array} \tag{11.54a}
$$

Comparing equation (11.52) with equation (11.36), evaluated at half- height  $(|\eta - \eta_0| = \gamma_L)$ , shows that  $x$  is the nondimensional optical thickness of the gas layer,  $\kappa_{\eta}X$ , at that location. Therefore, the parameter  $x$  gives an indication of the strength of the line. For a weak line  $(x\ll 1)$  little absorption takes place so that every position in the gas layer receives the full irradiation, resulting in a linear absorption rate (with distance). In the case of a strong line  $(x\gg 1)$  the radiation intensity has been appreciably weakened before exiting the gas layer, resulting in locally lesser absorption and causing the square- root dependence of equation (11.54b).

# 11.5 NONEQUILIBRIUM RADIATION

There are many radiation applications, in which local thermal equilibrium cannot be assumed, such as in the plasma generated during atmospheric entry of spacecraft, ballistic ranges, high- speed shock tubes, arc jets, etc. When a gas is not in thermal equilibrium, its state cannot be described by a single temperature [48], and the populations of internal energy states do not follow Boltzmann distributions, equation (11.5). The thermodynamic state may then be described using a multitemperature approach (i.e., a Boltzmann distribution is assumed for each internal mode with a specific temperature) [49]. Alternatively, level population distributions may be calculated directly, taking into account collisional and radiative processes. This is known as the Collisional- Radiative model (CR) [50, 51] or, if infinitely fast reaction rates are assumed, the Quasi- Steady State (QSS) approximation [49]. Most often the more closely spaced energy levels for translation, rotation, vibration, and free electrons are assumed to have individual equilibrium distributions with up to four different temperatures  $(T_{t},T_{r},T_{e},T_{e})$ , while the widely spaced electronic energy levels are modeled using the QSS/CR approach. Once all energy state distributions have been determined, the emission is given by equation (11.20). Relating it to the absorption coefficient one may define a nonequilibrium Planck function, from equation (11.21), as (in terms of wavenumbers)

$$
I_{b\eta}^{\mathrm{ne}} = \frac{j_{\eta}}{\kappa_{\eta}} = 2hc_0^2\eta^3\frac{n_u}{n_l - n_u}. \tag{11.55}
$$

An example is given in Fig. 11- 10, showing the nonequilibrium Planck function for diatomic CN (a strongly radiating ablation product from thermal protection systems) [52]. In this graph a two- temperature model was adopted with  $T_{t} = T_{r} = 15,000\mathrm{K}$  and  $T_{v} = T_{el} = T_{e} = 10,000\mathrm{K}$  (with electronic energy levels in equilibrium at  $T_{el}$ ), and only Doppler broadening was considered. The ultraviolet CN band  $(1\leftrightarrow 3$  electronic transition) is shown, including many vibration- rotation subbands. For example, the lines labeled  $\Delta v = v_{u} - v_{l} = - 2$  imply that the vibrational energy of the upper (electronic) level is two levels lower than that of the lower (electronic) energy state, and so on. The nonequilibrium Planck function displays line structure similar to that of the

FIGURE 11-10 Nonequilibrium Planck function for CN for a two-temperature model (electronic, vibrational, and electron states at equilibrium with  $T_{v}$ , rotational and translational states with  $T_{r}$ ).

absorption coefficient. This can be better understood by looking at the special case of negligible stimulated emission and no line overlap (both good approximations for the present case). Then [cf. equation (11.31)]

$$
\frac{I_{b\eta}^{\mathrm{ne}}(T_v,T_r)}{I_{b\eta}(T_v)} = \frac{n_u}{n_l} e^{b\epsilon_{\eta} / kT_v} = \frac{[Q_{vr,l} / Q_{vr,u}]^{\mathrm{ne}}(T_v,T_r)}{[Q_{vr,l} / Q_{vr,u}](T_v)}\exp \left[\frac{E_{ru} - E_{rl}}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T_v} -\frac{1}{T_r}\right)\right], \tag{11.56}
$$

where  $Q_{vr}$  is the rovibrational partition function (depending on temperature only), and  $E_{r}$  is the rotational energy level. Note that  $u$  and  $l$  refer to the upper and lower states of the total transition, always determined by the electronic level, i.e.,  $E_{ru} - E_{rl}$  is the rotational energy change for a given transition (spectral line), which can be negative (lines below the equilibrium Planck function in Fig. 11- 10).

As can be appreciated from the discussion in this section, and on electronic transitions in Section 11.3, radiation in high- temperature nonequilibrium plasmas is considerably more complicated than usually encountered in engineering, and is beyond the scope of the present text. The reader is referred to the literature dedicated to such problems [49,53].

# 11.6 HIGH-RESOLUTION SPECTROSCOPIC DATABASES

During the past 40 years or so, due to the advent of high- resolution spectroscopy (mostly FTIR spectrometers), it has become possible to measure strengths and positions of individual spectral lines. A first collection of spectral data was assembled in the late 1960s by the Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories for atmospheric scientists, including low- temperature data for the major constituents of the Earth's atmosphere, and was published in 1973 as an Air Force report [54]. With contributions from many researchers across the world this grew into the HITRAN database (an acronym for HIgh resolution TRANsmission molecular absorption), first published in 1987 [55]. The database is maintained by the Harvard- Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, with periodic updates [32, 56- 59]. The latest version at present is HITRAN

2008 [32], which includes detailed information on 39 species with a total of about 2.7 million lines.

As the popularity of HITRAN grew, the need for a database valid at elevated temperatures became obvious. A first attempt was made by the group around Taine in France, who augmented HITRAN 1986 data for water vapor and carbon dioxide through theoretical calculations [60, 61]. A development by the HITRAN group resulted in a first version of HITEMP (1995) [62] for  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ ,  $\mathrm{CO}_2$ ,  $\mathrm{CO}$ , and  $\mathrm{OH}$ , using theoretical models. Comparison with experiment [63- 66] indicated that HITEMP 1995 greatly overpredicted  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  emissivities above  $1000\mathrm{K}$ , while agreement for  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  was acceptable. More accurate and extensive calculations for  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  were carried out in Russia, resulting in several versions of the CDSD- 1000 database [67, 68] (with the 2008 version containing 4 million lines), which were shown to agree well with experiment. The latest version of CDSD, called CDSD- 4000 [69], aims to be accurate up to  $4000\mathrm{K}$ , and has 628 million lines, requiring 23 GB of storage. Several extensive high- temperature collections were developed for  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ : the Ames database [70] includes 300 million lines, SCAN [71] contains 3 billion, and the BT2 collection [72] has 500 million lines; building up on the Ames database, Perez et al. [73] rejected lines from the Ames collection that remain weak below  $3000\mathrm{K}$ , and combined it with well- established lines from HITRAN 2001 and HITEMP 1995, culminating in a manageable collection with 1.3 million lines. Finally, in 2010 a new version of HITEMP was released [74], designed for temperatures up to  $3000\mathrm{K}$ . Citing best agreement against experimental data, HITEMP 2010 incorporates and extends CDSD 2008 for  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  (11 million lines) and a slimmed- down version of BT2 for  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  (111 million lines). HITEMP 2010 also includes data for three diatomic gases (CN, CO, and OH) with their relatively few lines. Approximate high- temperature data for methane (up to  $2000\mathrm{K}$ ) are available from [75]. An example calculation is given in Fig. 11- 11, showing a small part of the artificial spectrum of the  $4.3\mu \mathrm{m}\mathrm{CO}_2$  band, generated from the HITRAN database [32], assuming Lorentz broadening, and containing more than 1,500 spectral lines. The top frame of Fig. 11- 11 shows the pressure- based absorption coefficient of  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  at low partial pressure in air at a total pressure of 10 mbar. Because of the relatively low total pressure, the lines are fairly narrow, resulting in little overlap. If the total pressure is raised to 1 bar, shown in the center frame, lines become strongly broadened, leading to substantial line overlap, and a smoother variation in the absorption coefficient (with considerably lower maxima and higher minima). At the high temperatures usually encountered during combustion the spectral lines narrow considerably [see equation (11.38)], decreasing line overlap; at the same time the strengths of the lines that were most important at low temperature decrease according to equation (11.35) and finally, at high temperatures "hot lines," that were negligible at room temperature, become more and more important. To be valid up to  $3000\mathrm{K}$  HITEMP 2010 [74] lists more than 22,000 spectral lines for this small wavenumber range. The result is a fairly erratic looking absorption coefficient as depicted in the bottom frame of Fig. 11- 11. If high temperatures are combined with low total pressures (not shown), the spectral behavior of the absorption coefficient resembles high- frequency electronic noise. Fortunately, heat transfer calculations in media at low total pressure are rare (they are important, though, in meteorological applications dealing with the low- pressure upper atmosphere).

Similar efforts have been made by the plasma radiation community. RAD/EQUIL is perhaps the earliest attempt, including contributions from atomic lines and continua, and approximate models for molecules, but only for thermodynamic equilibrium conditions [76]. The NonEQuilibrium AIr Radiation (NEQAIR) model [77] was originally developed for the study of radiative properties of nonequilibrium, low density air plasmas. The updated NEQAIR96 model [78] includes spectral line data for spontaneous emission, stimulated emission, and absorption for 14 monatomic and diatomic species, as well as bound- free and free- free transition data for atoms. Nonequilibrium electronic level populations are determined using the QSS approximation (cf. Section 11.5). Since the creation of NEQAIR various improvements have been made by Laux [79] and others, leading to the SPECAIR database [80]. In Japan the SPRADIAN database was assembled [81], which was recently updated in cooperation with KAIST [82]. A new High-

temperature Aerothermodynamic RAdiation model (HARA) developed by Johnston [50, 83] utilizes comprehensive and updated atomic line data obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) online database [84] and the Opacity Project [85], as well as atomic bound- free cross- sections from the TOPbase [86]. Since the above databases are generally stand- alone programs, incorporating several other tools, such as primitive RTE solvers, Sohn et al. [87] extracted the relevant data from NEQAIR96 to form an efficient radiative property module. This database has very recently been updated for high- speed retrieval rates and to incorporate the state- of- the- art data in HARA [88].

# 11.7 SPECTRAL MODELS FOR RADIATIVE TRANSFER CALCULATIONS

A single spectral line at a certain spectral position is fully characterized by its strength (the intensity, or integrated absorption coefficient) and its line half- width (plus knowledge of the broadening mechanism, i.e., collision and/or Doppler broadening). However, a vibration- rotation band has many closely spaced spectral lines that may overlap considerably. While the absorption coefficients for individual lines may simply be added to give the absorption coefficient of an entire band at any spectral position,

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \sum_{j}\kappa_{\eta j}, \tag{11.57}
$$

the resulting function tends to gyrate violently across the band (as seen in Figs. 11- 6 and 11- 11), unless the lines overlap very strongly. This tendency, plus the fact that there may be literally millions of spectral lines, makes radiative transfer calculations a truly formidable task, if the exact relationship is to be used in the spectral integration for total intensity [equation (10.28)], total radiative heat flux [equation (10.52)], or the divergence of the heat flux [equation (10.59)]. This has prompted the development of a number of approximate spectral models. Exact and approximate methods may be loosely put into four groups (in order of decreasing complexity and accuracy): (1) line- by- line calculations, (2) narrow band calculations, (3) wide band calculations, and (4) global models.

Line- By- Line Calculations With the advent of powerful computers and the necessary high- resolution spectroscopic databases, a number of spectrally resolved or "line- by- line calculations" have been performed, a few for actual heat transfer calculations, e.g., [89- 91], some to prepare narrow band model correlations, e.g., [92, 93], and others to validate global spectral models, e.g., [94- 96]. Such calculations rely on very detailed knowledge of every single spectral line, taken from one of the high- resolution spectroscopic databases described in Section 11.6. Because of strongly varying values of the absorption coefficient (see Fig. 11- 11), the spectral radiative transfer problem must be solved for up to one million wavenumbers, followed by integration over the spectrum. While such calculations may be the most accurate to date, they require vast amounts of computer resources. This is and will remain undesirable, even with the availability of powerful computers, since radiative calculations are usually only a small part of a sophisticated, overall fire/combustion code. In addition, high- resolution gas property data (resolution of better than  $0.01\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ), which are required for accurate line- by- line calculations, are generally found from theoretical calculations and mostly still remain to be validated against experimental data. In particular, temperature and pressure dependence of spectral line broadening is very complicated and simply not well enough understood to extrapolate room temperature data to the high temperatures important in combustion environments. For these reasons it is fair to assume that, for the foreseeable future, line- by- line calculations will only be used as benchmarks for the validation of more approximate spectral models.

Narrow Band Models When calculating spectral radiative fluxes from a molecular gas one finds that the gas absorption coefficient (and with it, the radiative intensity) varies much more rapidly across the spectrum than other quantities, such as blackbody intensity, etc. It is, therefore,

in principle possible to replace the actual absorption coefficient (and intensity) by smoothened values appropriately averaged over a narrow spectral range. A number of such "narrow band models" were developed some 40- 50 years ago, and will be examined in the following section. In principle, narrow band calculations can be as accurate as line- by- line calculations, provided an "exact" narrow band average can be found. The primary disadvantages of such narrow band models are that they are difficult to apply to nonhomogeneous gases and the fact that heat transfer calculations, based on narrow band data and using general solution methods, are limited to nonscattering media within a black- walled enclosure.

An alternative to the "traditional" narrow band models is the so- called "correlated  $k$ - distribution." In this method it is observed that, over a narrow spectral range, the rapidly oscillating absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{\eta}$  attains the same value many times (at slightly different wavenumbers  $\eta$ ), each time resulting in identical intensity  $I_{\eta}$  and radiative flux (provided the medium is homogeneous, i.e., has an absorption coefficient independent of position). Since the actual wavenumbers are irrelevant (across the small spectral range), in the correlated  $k$ - distribution method the absorption coefficient is reordered, resulting in a smooth dependence of absorption coefficient vs. artificial wavenumber (varying across the given narrow range). This, in turn, makes spectral integration very straightforward.  $k$ - distributions are relatively new, and are still undergoing development. While attractive, they also are difficult to apply to nonhomogeneous media.

Wide Band Models Wide band models make use of the fact that, even across an entire vibration- rotation band, blackbody intensity does not vary substantially. In principle, wide band correlations are found by integrating narrow band results across an entire band, resulting in only slightly lesser accuracy. Wide band model calculations have been very popular in the past, due to the facts that the necessary calculations are relatively simple and that much better spectral data were not available. However, it is well recognized that wide band correlations have a typical correlational accuracy of  $\pm 30\%$ , and in some cases may be in error by as much as  $70\%$ ; substantial additional but unquantified errors may be expected due to experimental inaccuracies. One of the attractions of the correlated  $k$ - distributions is that they can be readily adapted to wide band calculations.

Global Models In heat transfer calculations it is generally only the (spectrally integrated) total radiative heat flux or its divergence that are of interest. Global models attempt to calculate these total fluxes directly, using spectrally integrated radiative properties. Most early global methods employ the total emissivities and absorptivities of gas columns, but more recently full- spectrum correlated  $k$ - distributions have also been developed.

During the remainder of this chapter we will discuss the smoothing of spectral radiative properties of molecular gases over narrow bands and wide bands, as well as the evaluation of total properties. Actual heat transfer calculations using these data will be deferred until Chapter 20 (i.e., until after the discussion of particulate properties and of solution methods for the radiative transfer equation). Global models require manipulation of the RTE and, thus, will also be deferred to Chapter 20.

# 11.8 NARROW BAND MODELS

Examination of the formal solution to the equation of radiative transfer, equation (10.28), shows that all spectral integrations may be reduced to four cases, namely,

$$
\int_0^\infty \kappa_\eta I_{(b)\eta}d\eta \quad \mathrm{and}\quad \int_0^\infty I_{(b)\eta}\left[1 - \exp \left(-\int_0^X\kappa_\eta dX\right)\right]d\eta , \tag{11.58}
$$

where  $I_{(b)\eta}$  denotes that either  $I_{b\eta}$  or  $I_{\eta}$  can occur, and  $X$  is the optical path length introduced in equation (11.48). It is clear from inspection of Fig. 1- 5 that the Planck function will never vary appreciably over the spectral range of a few lines, considering that adjacent lines are very closely spaced (measured in fractions of  $\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ). Local radiation intensity  $I_{\eta}$ , on the other hand,

![](images/7178f1de01e3523808c06dd02af3fe7bfc7056239638a57ea867f3874c198ceb.jpg)  
FIGURE 11-12 Typical spectral line arrangement for (a) Elsasser and (b) statistical model.

may vary just as strongly as the absorption coefficient, since emission within the gas takes place at those wavenumbers where  $\kappa_{\eta}$  is large [see equation (10.10)]. However, if we limit our consideration to nonscattering media bounded by black (or no) walls, the formal solution of the radiative equation of transfer, equation (10.29), shows that all spectral integrations involve only the Planck function, and not the local intensity. For such a restricted scenario<sup>4</sup> we may simplify expressions (11.58), with extremely good accuracy, to

$$
\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}\left\{\frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\eta -\Delta \eta /2}^{\eta +\Delta \eta /2}\kappa_\eta d\eta '\right\} d\eta \tag{11.59a}
$$

and

$$
\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}\left\{\frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\eta -\Delta \eta /2}^{\eta +\Delta \eta /2}\left[1 - \exp \left(-\int_0^X\kappa_\eta dX\right)\right]d\eta '\right\} d\eta . \tag{11.59b}
$$

The expressions within the large braces are local averages of the spectral absorption coefficient and of the spectral emissivity, respectively, indicated by an overbar<sup>5</sup>

$$
\overline{\kappa}_{\eta}(\eta) = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\eta -\Delta \eta /2}^{\eta +\Delta \eta /2}\kappa_{\eta}d\eta ', \tag{11.60}
$$

$$
\overline{\epsilon}_{\eta}(\eta) = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\eta -\Delta \eta /2}^{\eta +\Delta \eta /2}\left[1 - \exp \left(-\int_{0}^{X}\kappa_{\eta}dX\right)\right]d\eta '. \tag{11.61}
$$

One can expect the spectral variation of  $\overline{\kappa}$  and  $\overline{\epsilon}$  to be relatively smooth over the band, making spectral integration of radiative heat fluxes feasible.

To find spectrally averaged or "narrow band" values of the absorption coefficient and the emissivity, some information must be available on the spacing of individual lines within the group and on their relative strengths. A number of models have been proposed to this purpose, of which the two extreme ones are the Elsasser model, in which equally spaced lines of equal intensity are considered, and the statistical models, in which the spectral lines are assumed to have random spacing and/or intensity. A typical spectral line arrangement for these two extreme models is shown in Fig. 11- 12. The main distinction between the two models is the difference in line overlap. Both models will predict the same narrow band parameters for optically thin situations or nonoverlap conditions (since overlap has no effect), as well as for optically very strong situations (since no beam can penetrate through the gas, regardless of the overlapping

characteristics). Under intermediate conditions the Elsasser model will always predict a higher emissivity/absorptivity than the statistical models, since regular spacing always results in less overlap (for the same average absorption coefficient) [3]. The deviation between the models is never more than  $20\%$ . In the following we will limit our discussion to lines of Lorentz shape, since collision broadening generally dominates at the relatively high pressures encountered in heat transfer applications. Discussion on models for Doppler and Voigt line shapes can be found in the meteorological literature, e.g., [2].

# The Elsasser Model

We saw earlier in this chapter that diatomic molecules and linear polyatomic molecules have only two, identical rotational modes, resulting in a single set of lines (consisting of two or three branches, as shown in Fig. 11- 2 and Fig. 11- 5). For these gases one may expect spectral lines with nearly constant spacing and slowly varying intensity, in particular if the  $Q$ - branch is unimportant (or "forbidden") and if the folding back of the  $R$ - branch gives also only a small contribution.

Summing up the contributions from infinitely many Lorentz lines on both sides of an arbitrary line with center at  $\eta_0$ , we get

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \sum_{i = -\infty}^{\infty}\frac{S}{\pi}\frac{\gamma_{L}}{(\eta - \eta_{0} - id)^{2} + \gamma_{L}^{2}}, \tag{11.62}
$$

where  $d$  is the (constant) spacing between spectral lines. This series may be evaluated in closed form, as was first done by Elsasser, resulting in [97]

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \frac{S}{d}\frac{\sinh 2\beta}{\cosh 2\beta - \cos(z - z_0)}, \tag{11.63}
$$

where

$$
\beta \equiv \pi \gamma_{L} / d,\qquad z\equiv 2\pi \eta /d. \tag{11.64}
$$

From equation (11.60), the average absorption coefficient is simply

$$
\overline{\kappa}_{\eta} = \frac{S}{d}. \tag{11.65}
$$

This also follows without integration from the fact that  $S$  is each line's contribution to the integrated absorption coefficient [see equation (11.36)], and that the lines are spaced  $d$  wavenumbers apart, i.e., for every  $d$  wavenumbers  $S$  is added to the integrated absorption coefficient. The spectrally averaged emissivity may be evaluated from equation (11.61) as

$$
\overline{\delta}_{\eta} = 1 - \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\exp \left(-\frac{2\beta x\sinh 2\beta}{\cosh 2\beta - \cos z}\right)dz, \tag{11.66}
$$

where, since the absorption coefficient is a periodic function, one full period was chosen for the averaging wavenumber range and, thus, the arbitrary location  $z_0$  could be eliminated. As one may see from its definition, equation (11.64),  $\beta$  is the line overlap parameter:  $\beta$  gives an indication of how much the individual lines overlap each other, and  $x$ , already defined in equation (11.52), is the line strength parameter. At this point we may also define another nondimensional parameter, the narrow band optical thickness  $\tau = \overline{\kappa} X$ , so that we now have three characterizing parameters, namely,

$$
x = \frac{SX}{2\pi\gamma_L},\quad \beta = \pi \frac{\gamma_L}{d},\quad \tau = \frac{S}{d} X = 2\beta x. \tag{11.67}
$$

Equation (11.66) cannot be solved in closed form, but an accurate approximate expression, known as the Godson approximation, has been given [2]:

$$
\bar{\epsilon}_{\eta}\approx \mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\frac{W}{d}\right) = \mathrm{erf}\left(\frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2}\frac{S}{d} Xe^{-x}[I_{0}(x) + I_{1}(x)]\right) = \mathrm{erf}\left(\sqrt{\pi}\beta L(x)\right) \tag{11.68}
$$

where erf is the error function and is tabulated in standard mathematical texts [98]. The Godson approximation is reasonably accurate for small- to- moderate line overlap  $(\beta < 1)$ . For larger values of  $\beta$ , and for hand calculations it is desirable to have simpler expressions. We can distinguish among three different limiting regimes:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}\mathrm{weak~lines~}(x\ll 1): & \bar{\epsilon}_{\eta} = 1 - \exp \left(-\frac{S}{d} X\right) = 1 - e^{-\tau},\\ \mathrm{strong~overlap~}(\beta >1): & \bar{\epsilon}_{\eta} = \mathrm{erf}\left(\sqrt{\pi\frac{S}{d}\frac{\gamma_{L}}{d}X}\right) = \mathrm{erf}\left(\sqrt{\tau\beta}\right),\\ \mathrm{strong~lines~}(x\gg 1): & \bar{\epsilon}_{\eta} = \mathrm{erf}\left(\sqrt{\pi\frac{S}{d}\frac{\gamma_{L}}{d}X}\right) = \mathrm{erf}\left(\sqrt{\tau\beta}\right),\\ \mathrm{no~overlap~}(\beta \ll 1): & \bar{\epsilon}_{\eta} = \frac{W}{d} = 2\beta L(x), \end{array} \tag{11.69a}
$$

where the  $W / d$  in equation (11.69c) can possibly be further simplified using equations (11.54a) and (11.54b). These relations are summarized in Table 11.1.

# The Statistical Models

In the statistical models it is assumed that the spectral lines are not equally spaced and of equal strength but, rather, are of random strength and are randomly distributed across the narrow band. This assumption can be expected to be an accurate representation for complex molecules for which lines from different rotational modes overlap in an irregular fashion. In several early studies Goody [99] and Godson [100] showed that any narrow band model with randomly placed spectral lines, with arbitrary strengths and line shape (i.e., Lorentzian or other) leads to the same expression for the spectrally averaged emissivity,

$$
\bar{\epsilon}_{\eta} = 1 - \exp \left(-\frac{\overline{W}}{d}\right), \tag{11.70}
$$

where  $\overline{W}$  is an average over the  $N$  lines contained in the spectral interval,

$$
\overline{W} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}W_{i}, \tag{11.71}
$$

and  $d$  is the average line spacing, defined as

$$
d = \frac{\Delta\eta}{N}. \tag{11.72}
$$

A number of statistical models have been developed, in which lines are placed at random across  $\Delta \eta$  with random strengths picked from different probability distributions. We will limit our brief discussion to three different models, which excel due to their simplicity and/or their success to model actual spectral distributions.

The simplest statistical model is the uniform statistical model, in which all lines have equal strengths, or

$$
\mathrm{Uniform~static~model:}\qquad S = \overline{S} = \mathrm{const.} \tag{11.73}
$$

A more realistic representation must allow for varying lines strengths, given by a probability density function  $p(S)$ . The properties of the narrow band are then found by averaging line properties with the probability density function. A frequently used such probability distribution is the exponential form proposed by Goody [99],

$$
p(S) = \frac{1}{S}\exp \left(-\frac{S}{S}\right),\quad 0\leq S< \infty , \tag{11.74}
$$

which is popular due to its simplicity. However, Malkmus [101] recognized that in many cases this exponential intensity distribution severely underpredicts the number of low- strength lines. He modified the physically plausible  $1 / S$  distribution proposed by Godson [100] to obtain an exponential- tailed  $1 / S$  distribution, now known as the Malkmus model:

$$
p(S) = \frac{1}{S}\exp \left(-\frac{S}{S}\right),\quad 0\leq S< \infty . \tag{11.75}
$$

All three distribution functions, equations (11.73), (11.74), and (11.75), have identical average line strengths  $\overline{S}$ .

Finding the average equivalent line width  $\overline{W}$  for the uniform statistical model is trivial, since every equivalent line width from equation (11.73) is identical, and  $\overline{W} = W$  (single line). For the Goody and Malkmus model the sum in equation (11.71) can, for a large statistical sample, be replaced by an integral:

$$
\overline{W}\underset {N\rightarrow \infty}{\longrightarrow}\int_{0}^{\infty}p(S)W(S)dS = \int_{0}^{\infty}p(S)\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}(S)X}\right)d\eta dS. \tag{11.76}
$$

Substituting equations (11.74) and (11.75) and carrying out the integrations leads to, for Lorentz lines,

$$
\mathrm{Uniform~statistic~model:}\frac{\overline{W}}{d} = 2\pi \frac{\overline{\gamma}_L}{d} L\left(\frac{\overline{S}X}{2\pi\overline{\gamma}_L}\right) = 2\beta L(x) = 2\beta L(\tau /2\beta), \tag{11.77}
$$

Goody model:

$$
\frac{\overline{W}}{d} = \frac{\overline{S}}{d} X[(1 + \frac{\overline{S}X}{\pi\overline{\gamma}_L})^{1 / 2} = \tau \left/(1 + \tau /\beta)^{1 / 2}, \tag{11.78}
$$

Malkmus model:

$$
\frac{\overline{W}}{d} = \frac{\pi\overline{\gamma}_L}{2d}\left[\left(1 + \frac{4\overline{S}X}{\pi\overline{\gamma}_L}\right)^{1 / 2} - 1\right] = \frac{\beta}{2}\left[(1 + 4\tau /\beta)^{1 / 2} - 1\right], \tag{11.79}
$$

where  $L(x)$  is the Ladenburg- Reiche function given by equation (11.51). In these models the narrow band parameters  $\overline{\gamma}_L / d$  and  $\overline{S} /d$  are either found by fitting experimental data, or from high- resolution spectral data, such as the HITRAN database [32]. In the latter case, it is desirable to have the models yield exact results in the limits of weak lines  $(x\ll 1)$  as well as strong lines  $(x\gg 1)$ . In the weak line limit we have, for all three models,

$$
\mathrm{weak~lines~}(x\ll 1):\quad \frac{\overline{W}}{d}\rightarrow \frac{\overline{S}}{d} X = 2\beta x = \tau , \tag{11.80}
$$

while the models lead to slightly different strong line limits, i.e.,

strong lines  $(x\gg 1)$  :

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathrm{Uniformstatistic:}\frac{\overline{W}}{d}\rightarrow \frac{2\sqrt{\overline{\gamma_L}\overline{S}X}}{d} = 2\beta (2x / \pi)^{1 / 2} = 2(\tau \beta /\pi)^{1 / 2},}\\ & {\mathrm{Goody / Malkmu s:}\frac{\overline{W}}{d}\rightarrow \frac{\sqrt{\pi\overline{\gamma_L}\overline{S}X}}{d} = \beta (2x)^{1 / 2} = (\tau \beta)^{1 / 2}.} \end{array} \tag{11.81b}
$$

Satisfying these two conditions requires [2]

$$
\frac{\overline{S}}{d} = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}S_{i},\qquad \frac{\overline{\gamma}_{L}}{d} = \frac{C_{\gamma}}{\Delta\eta}\frac{\left[\sum_{i = 1}^{N}(S_{i}\gamma_{ui})^{1 / 2}\right]^{2}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}S_{i}}, \tag{11.82}
$$

with  $C_{\gamma} = 1$  for the uniform statistical model, and  $C_{\gamma} = 4 / \pi$  for the Goody and Malkmus models; the latter two models will always have some weak lines, resulting in a smaller value for  $\overline{W} /d,$  even in the strong line limit (based on average line strength). The results from the statistical models have also been summarized in Table 11.1.

The narrow band emissivities from all four models are compared in Fig. 11- 13 as a function of the optical path of an average spectral line (i.e., average absorption coefficient  $\overline{S} /2\pi \overline{\gamma}_{L}$  multiplied by distance  $X$ ). Note that all predictions are relatively close to each other, although the statistical models may predict up to 20% lower emissivities for optically thick situations. The Goody and Malkmus models more or less coincide for small values of  $\beta$ , giving somewhat lower emissivities than the uniform statistical model because of their different strong line behavior. For optically thin situations  $(x< 1)$  the uniform statistical and Goody's model move toward the Elsasser model, with lower emissivities predicted by the Malkmus model. Note that the Elsasser lines were drawn from numerical evaluations of equation (11.66), not from equation (11.68), which would show serious error for the  $\beta = 1$  line.

Example 11.2. The following data are known at a certain spectral location for a pure gas at  $300\mathrm{K}$  and 0.75 atm: The mean line spacing is  $0.6\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , the mean line half- width is  $0.03\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , and the mean line strength (or integrated absorption coefficient) is  $0.08\mathrm{cm}^{- 2}\mathrm{atm}^{- 1}$ . What is the mean spectral emissivity for geometric path lengths of  $1\mathrm{cm}$  and  $1\mathrm{m}$ , if the gas is diatomic (such as CO), or if the gas is polyatomic (such as water vapor)?

FIGURE 11-13 Mean spectral emissivities for Lorentz lines as a function of average optical depth  $(\overline{S} /d)X$ .

# Solution

Since the units of the given line strength tell us that a pressure absorption coefficient has been used, we need to employ a pressure path length  $X = ps$ . For a path length of  $1\mathrm{cm}$  we get  $X = 0.75\mathrm{atm}\times 1\mathrm{cm} = 0.75\mathrm{cm}$  atm and  $x = SX / 2\pi \gamma = 0.08\mathrm{cm}^{- 2}\mathrm{atm}^{- 1}\times 0.75\mathrm{cm}$  atm  $(2\pi 0.03\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}) = 1 / \pi$ , while the overlapping parameter turns out to be  $\beta = \pi \gamma /d = \pi \times 0.03\mathrm{cm}^{- 1} / 0.6\mathrm{cm}^{- 1} = \pi /20$ , and  $\tau = 2\beta x = 2(\pi /20)(1 / \tau) = 0.1$ . For a diatomic gas for which the Elsasser model should be more accurate, we can use either equation (11.68) or (since  $\beta \ll 1$ ) equation (11.69c). Evaluating the Ladenburg- Reiche function from (11.53) gives

$$
L\left(\frac{1}{\pi}\right) = \frac{1}{\pi}\left[1 + 0.5^{5 / 4}\right]^{-2 / 5} = 0.2766,
$$

and

$$
\overline{\epsilon}_{\eta} = \mathrm{erf}\left(\sqrt{\pi}\frac{\pi}{20} 0.2766\right) = \mathrm{erf}\left(0.0770\right) = 0.0867\simeq 2\frac{\pi}{20} 0.2766 = 0.0869 = 8.7\% .
$$

If the gas is polyatomic we may want to use one of the statistical models. Choosing the Malkmus model, equation (11.79), we obtain

$$
\overline{\epsilon}_{\eta} = 1 - \exp \left\{-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\pi}{20}\left[\left(1 + \frac{4\times 0.1}{(\pi / 20)}\right)^{1 / 2} - 1\right]\right\} = 0.0670.
$$

If the path length is a full meter, we have  $X = 75\mathrm{cm}$  atm and  $x = 100 / \pi$  while  $\beta$  is still  $\beta = \pi /20$  and now  $\tau = 10$ . Thus we are in the strong- line region. For the diatomic gas, from equation (11.69b)  $\overline{\epsilon}_{\eta} = \mathrm{erf}\left[\sqrt{10(\pi / 20)}\right] = \mathrm{erf}(1.2533) = 0.924$ . For the polyatomic gas, again using equation (11.79), we get  $\overline{\epsilon}_{\eta} = 0.692$ .

In the first two cases, using the simple relation  $\overline{\epsilon} = 1 - \exp (- \overline{\kappa}\mathrm{s})$  actually would have given fairly good results (0.095) because the gas is optically thin resulting in essentially linear absorption at every wavenumber. For the larger path we would have gotten  $1 - e^{- 10}\approx 1$ . Thus, using an average value for the absorption coefficient makes the gas opaque at all wavenumbers rather than only near the line centers.

Example 11.3. For a certain polyatomic gas the line- width- to- spacing ratio and the average absorption coefficient for a vibration- rotation band in the infrared are known as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\left(\frac{S}{d}\right)_\eta \approx \left(\frac{S}{d}\right)_0e^{-2|\eta -\eta_0| / \omega},\left(\frac{S}{d}\right)_0 = 10\mathrm{cm}^{-1},}\\ {\omega = 50\mathrm{cm}^{-1},\frac{\gamma}{d}\approx 0.1\approx \mathrm{const}.} \end{array} \tag{11.83}
$$

Find an expression for the averaged spectral emissivity and for the total band absorptance, defined by

$$
A\equiv \int_{\mathrm{band}}\epsilon_{\eta}d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}X}\right)d\eta ,
$$

for a path length of  $20\mathrm{cm}$

# Solution

Calculating the optical thickness  $\tau_0 = (S / d)_0X = 10\times 20 = 200,$  the overlap parameter  $\beta = \pi /10,$  and the line strength  $x_0 = \tau_0 / 2\beta = 1000 / \pi ,$  we find that this band falls into the "strong- line" regime everywhere except in the (unimportant) far band wings. Since we have a polyatomic molecule with exponential decay of intensity, one of the statistical models should provide the best answer. As seen from Fig. 11- 13, all three statistical models give very similar results, and the (more appropriate) Goody and Malkmus models go to the same strong line limit, equation (11.81b), or

$$
\overline{\epsilon}_{\eta} = 1 - e^{-\overline{W} /d}\approx 1 - \exp \left(-\sqrt{\tau\beta}\right),
$$

since  $\tau /\beta \gg 1$  . Substituting yields the spectral emissivity,

$$
\overline{\epsilon}_{\eta} = 1 - \exp \left(-\sqrt{\tau_0\beta} e^{-\eta \eta -\eta_0 / \omega}\right).
$$

Integrating this equation over the entire band gives the total band absorptance,

$$
A = \int_{0}^{\infty}\left[1 - \exp \left(-\sqrt{\tau_{0}\beta} e^{-\eta \eta -\eta_{0} / \omega}\right)\right]d\eta .
$$

Realizing that this integral has two symmetric parts and setting  $\ln z = - (\eta - \eta_0) / \omega ,$  we have

$$
A = 2\omega \int_{0}^{1}\left[1 - \exp \left(-\sqrt{\tau_{0}\beta} z\right)\right]\frac{dz}{\overline{\tau}}.
$$

This integral may be solved in terms of exponential integrals' as given, for example, in Abramowitz and Stegun [98]. This leads to

$$
A = 2\omega \left(E_{1}(\sqrt{\tau_{0}\beta}) + \ln (\sqrt{\tau_{0}\beta}) + \gamma_{E}\right) = 264.7\mathrm{cm}^{-1},
$$

where  $\gamma_{E} = 0.57721\ldots$  is Euler's constant.

Most available narrow band property data, such as the RADCAL database [102, 103], have been correlated with the Goody model. The correlation by Malkmus is a relative latecomer, but is today recognized as the best model for polyatomic molecules. While commonly used in the atmospheric sciences this correlation was widely ignored by the heat transfer community for many years. Taine and coworkers [92, 93, 104] have generated artificial narrow band properties from HITRAN 1992 line- by- line data. Employing the Malkmus model with a resolution of  $25\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  they observed a maximum  $10\%$  error between line- by- line and narrow band absorptivities. Using two narrow spectral ranges of  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  Lacis and Oinas [105] showed that (for a resolution of  $10\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , and for total gas pressures above 0.1 atm) the correlational accuracy of the Malkmus model can be improved to better than  $1\%$  if the model parameters are found through least square fits of the HITRAN 1992 line- by- line data. Soufiani and Taine [106] have assembled the Malkmus- correlated EM2C narrow band database  $(25\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  resolution) for various gases, using the HITRAN 1992 database together with some proprietary French high- temperature extensions. However, to date very few experimental narrow band data have been correlated with the Malkmus model: Phillips has measured and correlated the  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  band [107] and the  $4.3\mu \mathrm{m}\mathrm{CO}_2$  band [108], both between room temperature and  $1000\mathrm{K}$ . Both the RADCAL and the EM2C databases are included in Appendix F.

More recently, two generalizations of the Malkmus model have been developed, a multiscale model for nonhomogeneous gases [109] (see also below) and a generalized model more appropriate for Doppler- dominated regimes [110].

7Exponential integrals are discussed in some detail in Appendix E.

# Gas Mixtures

Experimental data for narrow band properties, such as line overlap  $(\gamma /d)$  and average absorption coefficient  $(S / d)$ , are usually given from correlations of measurements performed on a homogeneous column involving a single absorbing gas species. In practical applications, on the other hand, radiative properties of mixtures that contain several absorbing gas species, such as  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ ,  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ ,  $\mathrm{CO}$ , etc., are generally required. Over large portions of the spectrum spectral lines from different species do not overlap each other, and the expressions given in Table 11.1 remain valid. However, there are regions of the spectrum where spectral line overlap is substantial and must be accounted for. For example, the two most important combustion gases, water vapor and  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ , both have strong bands in the vicinity of  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Mixture values for  $(\gamma /d)$  and  $(S / d)$  are found from their definitions, equation (11.82), by setting

$$
\sum_{i}S_{i} = \sum_{n}\sum_{i}S_{ni};\qquad \sum_{i}\sqrt{S_{i}\gamma_{i}} = \sum_{n}\sum_{i}\sqrt{S_{ni}\gamma_{ni}}, \tag{11.84}
$$

where the subscript  $n$  identifies the gas species. Comparing equation (11.82) for the mixture and its individual components readily leads to

$$
\left(\frac{S}{d}\right)_{\mathrm{mix}} = \sum_{n}\left(\frac{S}{d}\right)_{n};\qquad \left(\frac{\gamma}{d}\right)_{\mathrm{mix}}\left(\frac{S}{d}\right)_{\mathrm{mix}} = \left[\sum_{n}\sqrt{\left(\frac{\gamma}{d}\right)_{n}\left(\frac{S}{d}\right)_{n}}\right]^{2}. \tag{11.85}
$$

Expressions in Table 11.1 together with equation (11.85) can then be used to evaluate the transmissivity of a gas mixture. Other expressions for mixture values of  $(\gamma /d)$  and  $(S / d)$  have been discussed by Liu and coworkers [111].

Taine and Soufiani [4] pointed out that there is no physical reason why there should be any significant correlation between the spectral variation of absorption coefficients of different gas species. If one treats the absorption coefficients of the  $M$  species as statistically independent random variables, the transmissivity of a mixture can be evaluated as the product of the individual species' transmissivities,

$$
\overline{\tau}_{\eta ,\mathrm{mix}} = 1 - \overline{\epsilon}_{\eta ,\mathrm{mix}} = \prod_{m = 1}^{M}\overline{\tau}_{\eta ,m}. \tag{11.86}
$$

For example, comparing the mixture transmissivity of a room temperature water vapor- carbon dioxide mixture for the overlapping  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  region, calculated directly from the HITRAN database and from equation (11.86), they found them to be virtually indistinguishable.

# Nonhomogeneous Gases

Up to this point in calculating narrow band emissivities we have tacitly assumed that the gas is isothermal, and has constant total and partial pressure of the absorbing gas everywhere, i.e., we replaced the integral  $\int_0^T\kappa dX$  in equation (11.61) by  $\kappa X$ . We now want to expand our results to include nonhomogeneous gases. For the Elsasser model the solution to equation (11.66) is possible, but too cumbersome to allow a straightforward solution if properties are path- dependent. For the more important statistical models the same is true, especially if not only line strength,  $S$ , but also the line overlap parameter,  $\beta$ , varies along the path. Instead, one resorts to approximations. The best known and most widely used approximation is known as the Curtis- Godson two parameter scaling approximation [2, 112], which has been fairly successful. Other scaling approximations have been developed, e.g., the one by Lindquist and Simmons [113]. In the Curtis- Godson approximation the values of  $\tau$  and  $\beta$  used in equation (11.66), or (11.68) (Elsasser model) and equations (11.70) plus (11.77) through (11.79) (statistical models) are replaced by path- averaged values  $\widetilde{\tau}$  and  $\widetilde{\beta}$ . The proper values (scaling) for  $\widetilde{\tau}$  and

$\widetilde{\beta}$  are found by satisfying both the optically thin and optically thick limits. Thus, we find from equations (11.54a) and (11.54b), for a single line "i",

$$
\begin{array}{ll}{x\ll 1:} & {W_i = \int_0^X S_i(X)dX,}\\ {} & {}\\ {x\gg 1:} & {W_i = 2\sqrt{\int_0^X S_i(X)\gamma_{Li}(X)dX}.} \end{array} \tag{11.88}
$$

For many lines, from equation (11.71),

$$
x\ll 1:\qquad \overline{W} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\int_{0}^{X}S_{i}(X)dX = \int_{0}^{X}\overline{S} (X)dX. \tag{11.89}
$$

Now, from equation (11.69a) or (11.80),

$$
\overline{\tau} = \frac{\overline{W}}{d} = \int_{0}^{X}\left(\frac{\overline{S}}{d}\right)dX. \tag{11.90}
$$

For strong lines we obtain

$$
x\gg 1:\qquad \overline{W} = \frac{2}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\sqrt{\int_{0}^{X}S_{i}(X)\gamma_{Li}(X)dX}. \tag{11.91}
$$

If one assumes  $S_{i}$  and  $\gamma_{Li}$  to be separable, i.e., they can be written as, e.g.,  $S_{i}(X) = S_{i0}f_{s}(X)$ , where  $S_{i0}$  is a different constant for each line, and  $f_{s}(X)$  is a function of the path (but the same for each line), one can—after some manipulation—rewrite equation (11.91) as [4]

$$
x\gg 1:\qquad \overline{W}^{2} = \left(\frac{2}{N}\right)^{2}\int_{0}^{X}\left[\sum_{i = 1}^{N}\sqrt{S_{i}(X)\gamma_{Li}(X)}\right]^{2}dX. \tag{11.92}
$$

Comparing with equation (11.54b) [or (11.81)], and utilizing equation (11.82) we obtain

$$
\left(\frac{\overline{W}}{d}\right)^2 = \frac{4 / \pi}{C_\gamma}\widetilde{\tau}\widetilde{\beta} = \frac{4}{d^2}\int_0^X\overline{S} (X)\gamma_L(X)dX \tag{11.93}
$$

or

$$
\widetilde{\beta} = \frac{1}{\overline{\tau}}\int_{0}^{X}\frac{\overline{S}}{d}\beta dX. \tag{11.94}
$$

Equations (11.68) and (11.77) through (11.79) may now be used with  $\widetilde{\tau}$  and  $\beta$  to calculate narrow band emissivities for nonhomogeneous paths.

The accuracy of various scaling approximations was tested by Hartmann and coworkers [93, 104] for various nonhomogeneous conditions in  $\mathrm{CO_2 - N_2}$  and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} - \mathrm{N}_2$  mixtures. It was found that the Malkmus model together with the Curtis- Godson scaling approximation generally gave the most accurate results, except in the presence of strong (total) pressure gradients. More recently a multiscale Malkmus model was developed by Bharadwaj and Modest [109] to improve its accuracy for nonhomogeneous paths. In this scheme it is assumed that high- temperature spectral lines (coming from elevated vibrational energy levels, i.e., with larger lower level energy  $E_{l}$ ) are uncorrelated from lower temperature lines. This implies that transmissivities of the individual "scales" are multiplicative [equation (11.86)]. Separating the gas accordingly into

scales and applying equation (11.75) to each scale  $m$  as well as the Curtis- Godson approximation leads to

$$
\frac{\overline{W}}{d} = \sum_{m}\frac{\tilde{\beta}_{m}}{2}\left[\left(1 + \frac{4\tilde{\tau}_{m}}{\tilde{\beta}_{m}}\right)^{1 / 2} - 1\right], \tag{11.95}
$$

with  $\tilde{\tau}_{m}$  and  $\tilde{\beta}_{m}$  from equations (11.90) and (11.94). Bharadwaj and Modest also outlined how scales are to be defined, whether using experimental data or data from spectroscopic databases. Testing the method with various nonhomogeneous  $\mathrm{CO_2 - H_2O - N_2}$  mixtures, they found the 2- scale Malkmus model to be a factor of 2 to 5 more accurate than the standard Curtis- Godson approach.

# 11.9 NARROW BAND  $k$ -DISTRIBUTIONS

As in the case of "traditional" narrow band models (i.e., Elsasser and statistical models), we will start by looking at a homogeneous medium (constant temperature, pressure, and concentrations), i.e., a medium whose absorption coefficient is a function of wavenumber alone. In such a medium the spectral intensity depends on geometry, the Planck function,  $I_{b\eta}$ , emittance of bounding surfaces,  $\epsilon_{\eta}$ , the absorption and scattering coefficients of suspended particles,  $\kappa_{p\eta}$  and  $\sigma_{s\eta}$ , and finally the absorption coefficient of any absorbing gas. Over a small spectral interval, such as a few tens of wavenumbers, the Planck function and nongaseous radiation properties remain essentially constant. Thus, across such a small spectral interval the intensity varies with gas absorption coefficient alone. On the other hand, Fig. 11- 11 shows that the gas absorption coefficient varies wildly even across a very narrow spectrum, attaining the same value for  $\kappa_{\eta}$  many times, each time producing the identical intensity field within the medium. Thus, carrying out line- by- line calculations across such a spectrum would be rather wasteful, repeating the same calculation again and again. It would, therefore, be advantageous to reorder the absorption coefficient field into a smooth, monotonically increasing function, assuring that each intensity field calculation is carried out only once.

This reordering idea was first reported in the Western literature by Arking and Grossman [114], but they give credit to Kondratyev [115], who in turn credits a 1939 Russian paper. Other early publications on  $k$ - distributions are by Goody and coworkers [116], Lacis and Oinas [105], and Fu and Liou [117], all in the field of meteorology (atmospheric radiation). In the heat transfer area most of the work on  $k$ - distributions again is due to the group around Taine and Soufiani in France [106,118- 120].

The narrow band average of any spectral quantity that depends only on the gaseous absorption coefficient, such as intensity  $\overline{I}_{\eta}$ , transmissivity  $\overline{\tau}_{\eta}$ , etc., can be rewritten in terms of a  $k$ - distribution  $f(k)$  as follows (there expressed for transmissivity  $\overline{\tau}_{\eta}$ ):

$$
\overline{\tau}_{\eta}(X) = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}e^{-\kappa_{\eta}X}d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-kX}f(k)dk. \tag{11.96}
$$

The nature of  $k$ - distributions and how to evaluate them is best illustrated by looking at a very small part of the spectrum with very few lines. Figure 11- 14a shows a fraction of the  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ $15\mu \mathrm{m}$  band at 1 bar and  $296\mathrm{K}$  and, to minimize irregularity, with only the strongest 10 lines considered (two of them having their centers slightly outside the depicted spectral range). It is seen that the absorption coefficient goes through a number of minima and maxima; between any two of these the integral may be rewritten as

$$
\int e^{-\kappa_{\eta}X}d\eta = \int_{\kappa_{\eta ,\min}}^{\kappa_{\eta ,\max}}e^{-\kappa_{\eta}X}\left|\frac{d\eta}{d\kappa_{\eta}}\right|d\kappa_{\eta}.
$$

The absolute value sign comes from the fact that, where  $d\kappa_{\eta} / d\eta < 0$ , we have changed the direction of integration (always from  $\kappa_{\eta ,\min}$  to  $\kappa_{\eta ,\max}$ ). Therefore, integration over the entire

FIGURE 11-14 Extraction of  $k$ -distributions from spectral absorption coefficient data: (a) simplified absorption coefficient across a small portion of the  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ $15\mu \mathrm{m}$  band  $(p = 1.0\mathrm{bar},T = 296\mathrm{K})$ ; (b) corresponding  $k$ -distribution  $f(k)$  and cumulative  $k$ -distribution  $k(g)$ .

range  $\Delta \eta$  gives  $f(k)$  as a weighted sum of the number of points where  $\kappa_{\eta} = k$ ,

$$
f(k) = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\sum_{\eta}\left|\frac{d\eta}{d\kappa_{\eta}}\right|_{\eta}. \tag{11.97}
$$

Mathematically, this can be put into a more elegant form as

$$
f(k) = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\delta (k - \kappa_{\eta})d\eta , \tag{11.98}
$$

where  $\delta (k - \kappa_{\eta})$  is the Dirac- delta function defined by

$$
\delta (x) = \lim_{\delta \epsilon \to 0}\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & |x| > \delta \epsilon ,\\ \displaystyle \frac{1}{2\delta\epsilon}, & |x|< \delta \epsilon , \end{array} \right. \tag{11.99a}
$$

or

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta (x)dx = 1. \tag{11.99b}
$$

The  $k$ - distribution of the absorption coefficient in Fig. 11- 14a is shown as the thin solid line in Fig. 11- 14b. Even for this minuscule fraction of the spectrum with only three dominant lines,  $f(k)$  shows very erratic behavior: wherever the absorption coefficient has a maximum or minimum  $f(k)\to \infty$  since  $|d\kappa_{\eta} / d\eta | = 0$  at those points (6 in the present case); and wherever a semistrong line produces a wiggle in the absorption coefficient  $f(k)$  has a strong maximum. Thankfully, the  $k$ - distribution itself is not needed during actual calculations. Introducing the cumulative  $k$ - distribution function  $g(k)$  as

$$
g(k) = \int_0^k f(k)dk, \tag{11.100}
$$

we may rewrite the transmissivity (or any other narrow band- averaged quantity) as

$$
\overline{\tau}_{\eta}(X) = \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-kX}f(k)dk = \int_{0}^{1}e^{-k(g)X}dg, \tag{11.101}
$$

FIGURE 11-15  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ $k$  -distributions for the three cases depicted in Fig. 11-11.

with  $k(g)$  being the inverse function of  $g(k)$ , which is shown in Fig. 11- 14b as the thick solid line. Sticking equation (11.100) into (11.98) leads to

$$
g(k) = \int_0^k f(k)dk = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\int_0^k\delta (k - \kappa_\eta)dkd\eta = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}H(k - \kappa_\eta)d\eta , \tag{11.102}
$$

where  $H(k)$  is Heaviside's unit step function,

$$
H(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & x< 0,\\ 1, & x > 0. \end{array} \right. \tag{11.103}
$$

Thus,  $g(k)$  represents the fraction of the spectrum whose absorption coefficient lies below the value of  $k$  and, therefore,  $0\leq g\leq 1$  [this can also be seen by setting  $X = 0$  in equations (11.96) or (11.101), leading to  $\overline{\tau}_{\eta} = 1$ ],  $g$  acts as a nondimensional wavenumber (normalized by  $\Delta \eta$ ), and the reordered absorption coefficient  $k(g)$  is a smooth, monotonically increasing function, with minimum and maximum values identical to those of  $\kappa_{\eta}(\eta)$ .

In actual reordering schemes values of  $k$  are grouped over small ranges  $k_{j}\leq k< k_{j} + \delta k_{j} = k_{j + 1}$ , as depicted in Fig. 11- 14, so that

$$
dg(k_{j}) = f(k_{j})\delta k_{j}\simeq \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\sum_{i}\left|\frac{\delta\eta}{\delta\kappa_{\eta}}\right|_{i}\delta k_{j} = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\sum_{i}\delta \eta_{i}(k_{j}), \tag{11.104}
$$

where the summation over  $i$  collects all the occurrences where  $k_{j}< \kappa_{\eta}< k_{j + 1}$ , as also indicated in the figure. If the absorption coefficient is known from line- by- line data, the  $k$ - distribution is readily calculated from equation (11.104).

The  $k$ - distributions for the three cases in Fig. 11- 11 are shown in Fig. 11- 15. Because of the many maxima and minima in the absorption coefficient these functions show very erratic behavior, as expected. Numerically, one can never obtain the singularities  $f(k)\to \infty$ , and they appear as sharp peaks [strongly dependent on the spacing used for  $\eta$  and  $\delta k$  in equation (11.104)]. Inaccurate evaluation of  $f(k)$  (such as its peaks) has little influence on  $k(g)$ , which is much easier to determine accurately. This, and the fact that  $g(k)$  represents the fraction of wavenumbers with  $k_{\eta}\leq k$ , suggests a very simple method to evaluate  $f(k)\delta k$  and  $g(k)$ : the wavenumber range  $\Delta \eta$  is broken up into  $N$  intervals  $\delta \eta$  of equal width. The absorption coefficient at the center of each

FIGURE 11-16  $k$ -values as a function of cumulative  $k$ -distribution  $g$  for the three  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  cases depicted in Fig. 11-11.

interval is evaluated and, if  $k_{j}\leq \kappa_{\eta}< k_{j + 1},$  the value of  $f(k_{j})\delta k_{j}$  is incremented by  $1 / N.$  After all intervals have been tallied  $f(k_{j})\delta k_{j}$  contains the fraction of wavenumbers with  $k_{j}\leq \kappa_{\eta}< k_{j + 1},$  and

$$
g(k_{j + 1}) = \sum_{j' = 1}^{j}f(k_{j'})\delta k_{j'} = g(k_{j}) + f(k_{j})\delta k_{j}. \tag{11.105}
$$

The  $k(g)$  for the three cases in Fig. 11- 11 are shown in Fig. 11- 16.

Program nbkdistdb in Appendix  $\mathrm{F}$  is a Fortran code that calculates such a  $g(k)$  distribution directly from a spectroscopic database, while nbkdistsg determines a single  $k$ - distribution from a given array of wavenumber- absorption coefficient pairs. As an example for the determination of  $k$ - distributions, the instructions to nbkdistdb show how to obtain the distributions of Figs. 11- 15 and 11- 16.

The  $k$ - distribution can be found more easily if accurate narrow band transmissivity data are available: inspection of equation (11.96) shows that  $\overline{\tau}_{\eta}$  is the Laplace transform of  $f(k)$ , i.e.,

$$
f(k) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{\overline{\tau}_{\eta}(X)\} , \tag{11.106}
$$

where  $\mathcal{L}^{- 1}$  indicates inverse Laplace transform. This was first recognized by Domoto [121], who also found an analytical expression for the  $k$ - distribution based on the Malkmus model, equation (11.79):

$$
f(k) = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\overline{\kappa\beta}}{\pi k^3}}\exp \left[\frac{\beta}{4}\left(2 - \frac{\overline{\kappa}}{k} -\frac{k}{\overline{\kappa}}\right)\right],\quad \overline{\kappa} = \frac{S}{d}. \tag{11.107}
$$

The cumulative  $k$ - distribution can also be determined analytically as

$$
g(k) = \frac{1}{2}\operatorname {erfc}\left[\frac{\sqrt{\beta}}{2}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\overline{\kappa}}{k}} -\sqrt{\frac{k}{\overline{\kappa}}}\right)\right] + \frac{1}{2} e^{\beta}\operatorname {erfc}\left[\frac{\sqrt{\beta}}{2}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\overline{\kappa}}{k}} +\sqrt{\frac{k}{\overline{\kappa}}}\right)\right], \tag{11.108}
$$

where erfc is the complementary error function [98] and, by convention,  $\operatorname {erfc}(- \infty) = 2$ .

Example 11.4. A certain diatomic gas is found to have an absorption coefficient that obeys Elsasser's model across a narrow band of width  $\Delta \eta = 10\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . The gas conditions are such that mean absorption coefficient  $(S / d)$  and overlap parameter  $\beta$  are known for the  $N = \Delta \eta /d$  lines across the narrow band. Determine the narrow band  $k$ - distribution of the gas.

# Solution

From equation (11.64) the absorption coefficient may be written as

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \frac{S}{d}\frac{\sinh 2\beta}{\cosh 2\beta - \cos\left(2\beta\frac{\eta - \eta_{c}}{\gamma}\right)},\quad \eta_{l}< \eta < \eta_{l} + \Delta \eta , \tag{11.109}
$$

where  $\eta_{l}$  is the minimum wavenumber of the narrow band and  $\eta_{c}$  is the line center position of any one line in the band. Because of the periodic nature of an Elsasser band (see Fig. 11- 12a), there will be exactly  $2N$  wavelengths where

$$
k_{\min} = \frac{S}{d}\frac{\sinh 2\beta}{\cosh 2\beta + 1} < k = \kappa_{\eta}< k_{\max} = \frac{S}{d}\frac{\sinh 2\beta}{\cosh 2\beta - 1}
$$

with identical  $|d\kappa_{\eta} / d\eta |$  each time. Therefore, from equation (11.97) or (11.98)

$$
f(k) = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int \delta (k - \kappa_{\eta})\left|\frac{d\eta}{d\kappa_{\eta}}\right|_{k = \kappa_{\eta}}d\kappa_{\eta} = \frac{2N}{\Delta\eta}\left|\frac{d\eta}{d\kappa_{\eta}}\right|_{k = \kappa_{\eta}}.
$$

But

$$
\left|\frac{d\kappa_{\eta}}{d\eta}\right| = \frac{S}{d}\frac{\sinh 2\beta}{\left[\cosh 2\beta - \cos\left(2\beta\frac{\eta - \eta_{c}}{\gamma}\right)\right]^2}\frac{2\beta}{\gamma}\sin \left(2\beta \frac{\eta - \eta_{c}}{\gamma}\right) = \frac{\kappa_{\eta}^2}{S}\frac{2\beta}{\sinh 2\beta}\frac{2\beta}{\gamma}\sin \left(2\beta \frac{\eta - \eta_{c}}{\gamma}\right),
$$

and

$$
\sin \left(2\beta \frac{\eta - \eta_c}{\gamma}\right) = \sin \left(\cos^{-1}\left[\cosh 2\beta -\frac{S}{d}\frac{\sinh 2\beta}{\kappa_{\eta}}\right]\right) = \sqrt{1 - \left[\cosh 2\beta - \frac{S}{d}\frac{\sinh 2\beta}{\kappa_{\eta}}\right]^2}.
$$

Therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{f(k) = \frac{2}{d}\frac{\gamma}{2\beta}\frac{\frac{S}{d}\sinh 2\beta}{k^2}\bigg / \sqrt{1 - \left[\cosh 2\beta - \frac{S}{d}\frac{\sinh 2\beta}{k}\right]^2}}\\ {= \frac{1}{\pi}\frac{\frac{S}{d}\sinh 2\beta}{k\sqrt{k^2 - \left(k\cosh 2\beta - \frac{S}{d}\sinh 2\beta\right)^2}}.} \end{array}
$$

Integrating  $f(k)$  according to equation (11.101) we obtain (using integration tables),

$$
\rho (k) = 1 - \frac{1}{\pi}\cos^{-1}\left[\cosh 2\beta -\frac{S}{d}\frac{\sinh 2\beta}{k}\right]
$$

or, after inversion,

$$
k = \frac{S}{d}\frac{\sinh 2\beta}{\cosh 2\beta - \cos\pi(1 - g)}. \tag{11.110}
$$

This is, of course, just equation (11.109) with  $2\beta (\eta - \eta_{c}) / \gamma$  replaced by  $\pi (1 - g)$ : the  $k$ - distribution recognizes that, in the Elsasser scheme, the same structure is repeated  $2N$  times (of that  $N$  times as a mirror image), and a single half- period is stretched across the entire reordered range  $0\leq g\leq 1$ . The present  $k$ - distribution can also be obtained by precalculating an array of absorption coefficients across  $\Delta \eta$  from equation (11.109) and using subroutine nbkdistsg in Appendix F.

Comparing equation (11.101) with the first expression in equation (11.96), we note that the integration in equation (11.101) is equivalent in difficulty to the integration over half of a single line. Given that a narrow spectral range can contain thousands of little overlapping lines, we conclude that the CPU time savings over line- by- line calculations can be enormous! However, the generation of the necessary  $k$ - distributions from the large number of spectral lines contained in the various spectroscopic databases is tedious and time consuming. A first database of

narrow band  $k$ - distributions for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  was offered by Soufani and Taine [106] as part of their EM2C narrow band database. It contains  $k$ - distribution data for fairly wide spectral intervals (larger than  $100\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ; 17 bands for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and 44 for  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ ), and are valid for atmospheric pressure and temperatures up to  $2500\mathrm{K}$ . Each  $k$ - distribution is defined by  $7k$ - values, to be used with a 7- point Gaussian quadrature for spectral integration. Like their Malkmus parameter counterparts they are generated from the HITRAN 1992 database plus proprietary extensions (cf. p. 333). A more accurate, highly compact database, also for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ , was generated by Wang and Modest [122], valid for total pressures between 0.1 bar and 30 bar, and temperatures between  $300\mathrm{K}$  and  $2500\mathrm{K}$ . The spectrum is divided into 248 narrow bands for all gases (allowing the determination of mixture  $k$ - distributions from those of individual species). Nested Gauss- Chebychev quadrature with up to 128 quadrature points is used to guarantee  $0.5\%$  accuracy for all absorption coefficient and emissivity calculations, and to allow for variable order spectral quadrature. The original Wang and Modest database employed the CDSD- 1000 database [67] (for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ ) and HITEMP 1995 [62] (for  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ ). This Narrow Band K- Distribution for InfraRed (NBKDIR) database has since then been augmented to include additional species  $(\mathrm{CO},\mathrm{CH}_4,$  and  $\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_4)$ , and is continuously updated to incorporate the newest spectroscopic data; at the time of print all  $k$ - distributions have been obtained from HITEMP 2010 [74]  $(\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O},\mathrm{CO}_2,$  and  $\mathrm{CO}$ ) and HITRAN 2008 [32],  $(\mathrm{CH}_4$  and  $\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_4)$ . Both EM2C and NBKDIR are included in Appendix F.

# Gas Mixtures

$k$ - distributions for mixtures can, in principle, be calculated directly, simply by adding the linear, spectral absorption coefficients of all components in the mixture before applying the reordering process, equation (11.104). Since assembling  $k$ - distributions is a tedious, time- consuming affair, it is desirable to obtain them from databases. However, determining an exact  $k$ - distribution for a mixture from those of individual species is in general impossible, because  $k$ - distributions never retain any information pertaining to the spectral location of individual absorption lines. Only in two simple situations is exact manipulation of  $k$ - distributions feasible: (1) a gas "mixing" with itself, i.e., changing the concentration of the absorbing gas species, and (2) adding a gray (across the given narrow band) material to the nongray absorbing gas.

Variable Mole Fraction of a Single Absorbing Gas Consider a gas whose absorption coefficient is linearly dependent on its partial pressure, i.e., a gas whose line broadening is unaffected by its own partial pressure. This is always true for molecules that have the same size as the surrounding broadening gas (such as  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  in air), and for all gases whenever Doppler broadening dominates. Then

$$
\kappa_{x\eta}(T,p,x;\eta) = x\kappa_{\eta}(T,p;\eta), \tag{11.111}
$$

where  $\kappa_{\eta}$  is the absorption coefficient of the pure gas and  $x$  is its mole fraction in a mixture. Comparing the two  $k$ - distributions

$$
f(T,p;k) = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\delta (k - \kappa_{\eta})d\eta , \tag{11.112}
$$

$$
f_{x}(T,p,x;k_{x} = xk) = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\delta (k_{x} - \kappa_{x\eta})d\eta , \tag{11.113}
$$

we see that they both are populated by exactly the same spectral locations (i.e.,  $k_{x} = \kappa_{x\eta}$  wherever  $k = \kappa_{\eta}$ ), so that

$$
f_{x}(T,p,x;k_{x})d(xk) = f(T,p;k)dk
$$

or

$$
f_{x}(T,p,x;k_{x}) = \frac{1}{x} f(T,p;k_{x} / x). \tag{11.114}
$$

FIGURE 11-17 Scalability of narrow band  $k$ -distributions:  $k$ : pure gas;  $k_{x}$ : gas with mole fraction  $x = 0.5$ ;  $k_{p}$ : gas mixed with gray medium of  $\kappa_{p} = 2\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ .

Integrating equation (11.114) leads to

$$
g(T,p;k) = \int_0^k f(T,p;k)dk = \int_0^{k_x}f_x(T,p,x;k_x)dk_x = g_x(T,p,x;k_x), \tag{11.115}
$$

i.e., the  $k$  vs.  $g$  behavior is independent of mole fraction. In a  $k$  vs.  $g$  plot the lines are simply vertically displaced by a multiplicative factor of  $x$ , or

$$
k_{x}(g) = \kappa k(g), \tag{11.116}
$$

as demonstrated in Fig. 11- 17 for a  $k$ - distribution based on the Malkmus model, equation (11.108) (using an unrealistically large overlap parameter of  $\beta = 10$  for better visibility).

Single Absorbing Gas Mixed with Gray Medium Consider a gas that is mixed with a gray medium (say, particles), with constant absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{p}$ . Then

$$
\kappa_{p\eta}(T,p,\kappa_p;\eta) = \kappa_\eta (T,p,\eta) + \kappa_p. \tag{11.117}
$$

Proceeding as in the previous paragraph we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{c}{f_p(T,p,\kappa_p;k_p) = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\delta (k_p - [\kappa_{x\eta} + \kappa_p])d\eta}\\ {= \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\delta ([k_p - \kappa_p] - \kappa_{x\eta})d\eta}\\ {= f(T,p;k = k_p - \kappa_p)} \end{array} \tag{11.118}
$$

and

$$
g(T,p;k) = g_{p}(T,p,\kappa_{p};k_{p} = k + \kappa_{p}), \tag{11.119}
$$

i.e., the  $k$  vs.  $g$  behavior is also independent of any gray additions. In a  $k$  vs.  $g$  plot the lines are simply vertically displaced by a constant amount of  $\kappa_{p}$ ,

$$
k_{p}(g) = \kappa_{p} + k(g), \tag{11.120}
$$

as also shown in Fig. 11- 17.

Multispecies Mixtures Several approximate mixing models for  $k$ - distributions have been proposed that rely on assumptions about the statistical relationships between the absorption lines of the individual species, mostly by Solovjov and Webb [123] (full spectrum models only),

such as their convolution, superposition, multiplication, and hybrid approaches, and by Modest and Riazzi [124], exploiting the uncorrelatedness between species. All of these approaches produce a single mixture  $k$ - distribution, but rely on different assumptions and methodologies to achieve their goal. It was found that the approach of Modest and Riazzi results in negligible errors for all conditions tested (low to moderate pressures). Very recently, Pal and Modest [125] found that their methodology works equally well at very high pressures (up to 30 bar), even though broadened spectral lines overlap much more strongly. Consequently, we will present here only the Modest and Riazzi mixing scheme.

Earlier it was shown how the idea of uncorrelated absorption coefficients can be used to obtain the transmissivity of a mixture, as given by equation (11.86). Through simple mathematical manipulation, it is possible to extend this logic to the mixing of cumulative  $k$ - distributions. We begin by recalling that the definition of the transmissivity, in terms of the  $k$ - distribution for a single absorbing species, is also the definition of the Laplace transform of  $f(k)$  [121], equation (11.106). Using this and the product of transmissivities model, the transmissivity of a mixture of  $M$  species may be expressed as the product of the Laplace transforms of the component  $k$ - distributions, or

$$
\bar{\tau}_{\eta ,\mathrm{mix}} = \mathcal{L}[f_{\mathrm{mix}}(k)] = \prod_{m = 1}^{M}\bar{\tau}_{\eta ,m} = \prod_{i = m}^{M}\mathcal{L}[f_m(k)]. \tag{11.121}
$$

In terms of the cumulative  $k$ - distributions, the transmissivity of an individual component is given by

$$
\bar{\tau}_{m} = \int_{0}^{1}e^{-k_{m}L}dg_{m}, \tag{11.122}
$$

and for a binary mixture this becomes

$$
\bar{\tau}_{\mathrm{mix}} = \mathcal{L}[f_{\mathrm{mix}}(k)] = \int_{0}^{1}e^{-k_{1}L}dg_{1}\int_{0}^{1}e^{-k_{2}L}dg_{2} = \int_{g_{1} = 0}^{1}\int_{g_{2} = 0}^{1}e^{-[k_{1}(g_{1}) + k_{2}(g_{2})]L}dg_{2}dg_{1}. \tag{11.123}
$$

Using the integral property of the Laplace transform we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathcal{L}\bigg[\int_0^k f_{\mathrm{mix}}(k)\bigg] = \mathcal{L}[g_{\mathrm{mix}}(k)] = \bigg(\int_{g_1 = 0}^1\int_{g_2 = 0}^1 e^{-[k_1(g_1) + k_2(g_2)]L}dg_2dg_1\bigg)\frac{1}{L}\\ = \int_{g_1 = 0}^1\int_{g_2 = 0}^1\frac{e^{-[k_1(g_1) + k_2(g_2)]L}}{L} dg_2dg_1, \end{array} \tag{11.124}
$$

or, when the inverse transform is taken, with  $H$  being the Heaviside step function,

$$
g_{\mathrm{mix}}(k_{\mathrm{mix}}) = \int_{g_1 = 0}^1\int_{g_2 = 0}^1 H[k_{\mathrm{mix}} - (k_1 + k_2)]dg_2dg_1 = \int_{g_1 = 0}^1 g_2(k_{\mathrm{mix}} - k_1)dg_1. \tag{11.125}
$$

In the second, once integrated expression, it is assumed that  $g_{m}(k< k_{m,\mathrm{min}}) = 0$  (i.e., all absorption coefficients are above  $k_{m,\mathrm{min}}$ ) and  $g_{m}(k > k_{m,\mathrm{max}}) = 1$  (i.e., all absorption coefficients are below  $k_{m,\mathrm{max}}$ ). This relation may also be readily extended to a mixture of  $M$  species,

$$
g_{\mathrm{mix}}(k_{\mathrm{mix}}) = \int_{g_1 = 0}^1\ldots \int_{g_M = 0}^1 H[k_{\mathrm{mix}} - (k_1 + \ldots +k_M)]dg_{M}\ldots dg_1. \tag{11.126}
$$

This integral may be evaluated by multiple Gaussian quadrature, leading to a single mixture  $k$ - distribution at specific  $k$ - values while using the component  $k$ - distributions stored at quadrature points with their associated weights. The  $k$ - values for this new mixture distribution must be

predetermined and chosen such that they cover the entire range of values of all component species. Carrying out mixing with this model consistently outperforms the models of Solovjov and Webb [123] (by a factor of 11 or more). Its accuracy is demonstrated in Fig. 11- 18 for a mixture of water vapor and carbon dioxide in the  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  region (where both gases heavily overlap), with absolute errors mostly below 0.005 (roughly the same as obtained by direct multiplication of transmissivities). The mixing scheme described here is incorporated into the NBKDIR database in Appendix F, i.e., NBKDIR allows for the retrieval of mixture  $k$  - distributions.

Example 11.5. Consider a mixture of two diatomic gases, both having absorption coefficients,  $\kappa_{1\eta}$  and  $\kappa_{2\eta},$  that obey Elsasser's model across a narrow band of width  $\Delta \eta = 10\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  . The following is known for the two gases:

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathrm{gas}1:d_1 = 0.2500\mathrm{cm}^{-1},\gamma_1 = 0.0250\mathrm{cm}^{-1},\frac{S_1}{d_1} = 1\mathrm{cm}^{-1};\beta_1 = \pi \frac{\gamma_1}{d_1} = \frac{\pi}{10} = 0.314;}\\ & {\mathrm{gas}2:d_2 = 0.1429\mathrm{cm}^{-1},\gamma_2 = 0.0050\mathrm{cm}^{-1},\frac{S_2}{d_2} = 2\mathrm{cm}^{-1};\beta_2 = \pi \frac{\gamma_2}{d_2} = \frac{7\pi}{200} = 0.110.} \end{array}
$$

Determine the narrow band  $k$  - distribution for this mixture.

# Solution

The individual  $k$  - distributions for the two component gases are given from the previous example as

$$
k_{i} = \left(\frac{S}{d}\right)_{i}\frac{\sinh 2\beta_{i}}{\cosh 2\beta_{i} - \cos\pi(1 - g_{i})};\quad i = 1,2. \tag{11.127}
$$

The  $k$  - distribution of the mixture is immediately found from the rightmost expression in equation (11.125) as

$$
g_{\mathrm{mix}}(k_{\mathrm{mix}}) = \int_{g_1 = 0}^{1}g_2(k_{\mathrm{mix}} - k_1)dg_1,k_{\mathrm{min}} = k_{1\mathrm{min}} + k_{2\mathrm{min}}\leq k_{\mathrm{mix}}\leq k_{\mathrm{max}} = k_{1\mathrm{max}} + k_{2\mathrm{max}}, \tag{11.128}
$$

where  $k_{1}$  is obtained from equation (11.127), while  $g_{2}$  is found from its inverse, or

$$
g_{2}(k) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & k< k_{2\min},\\ 1 - \frac{1}{\pi}\cos^{-1}\left[\cosh 2\beta_{2} - \left(\frac{S}{d}\right)_{2}\frac{\sinh 2\beta_{2}}{k}\right], & k_{2\min}< k< k_{2\max},\\ 1, & k > k_{2\max}. \end{array} \right.
$$

The integration in equation (11.128) is best carried out numerically. Here care must be taken that the argument of  $\cos^{- 1}$  does not fall outside its allowable range (between  $- 1$  and  $+1$  ). The same holds true

FIGURE 11-19 Narrow band  $k$ -distribution for a two-component mixture (Example 11.5): (a) absorption coefficients, (b)  $k$ -distributions.

for the mixing of any two  $k$ - distributions, i.e.,  $g_{2} \equiv 0$  for  $k_{\mathrm{mix}} - k_{1} \leq k_{2_{\mathrm{min}}}$ , and  $g_{2} \equiv 1$  for  $k_{\mathrm{mix}} - k_{1} \geq k_{2_{\mathrm{max}}}$ . The result of a simple trapezoidal rule integration is shown in Fig. 11- 19. Frame (a) shows the absorption coefficients for the mixture and the two component gases, and Frame (b) the corresponding  $k$ - distributions. The mixture  $k$ - distribution is calculated in two ways: "exactly," using the absorption coefficient in Fig. 11- 19a, or equation (11.109) (with random and different  $\eta_{1}$  for each gas), and with equation (11.129). Semilog plots are employed to better separate the various absorption coefficients and  $k$ - distributions. It is apparent that both mixture  $k$ - distributions virtually coincide (in fact, transmissivities calculated with both  $k$ - distributions coincide to within 5 digits).

# Nonhomogeneous Gases

Correlated-  $k$  Like the statistical models the  $k$ - distribution is not straightforward to apply to nonhomogeneous paths. However, it was found that for many important situations the  $k$ - distributions are essentially "correlated," i.e., if  $k$ - distributions  $k(g)$  are known at two locations in a nonhomogeneous medium, then the absorption coefficient can essentially be mapped from one location to the other (documented to some extent by Lacis and Oinas [105]). This implies that all the values of  $\eta$  that correspond to one value of  $\kappa$  and  $g$  at one location, more or less map to the same value of  $g$  (but a different  $\kappa$ ) at another location [105, 117]; pressure changes affect all lines equally (causing more or less broadening by higher/lower total pressure  $p$ , increasing line strengths uniformly by changes in partial pressure of the absorbing gas,  $p_{a}$ ). We may then write, with good accuracy,

$$
\overline{\tau}_{\eta}(0\to X) = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Omega^{\eta}}\exp \left(-\int_{0}^{X}\kappa_{\eta}dX\right)d\eta \simeq \int_{0}^{1}\exp \left(-\int_{0}^{X}k(X,g)dX\right)dg. \tag{11.129}
$$

This assumption of a correlated  $k$ - distribution has proven very successful in the atmospheric sciences, where temperatures change only from about  $200 \mathrm{K}$  to  $320 \mathrm{K}$ , but pressure changes can be very substantial [105, 116, 117].

Scaled-  $k$  A more restrictive, but mathematically precise condition for correlation of  $k$ - distributions is to assume the dependence on wavenumber and location in the absorption coefficient to be separable, i.e.,

$$
\kappa_{\eta}(\eta ,T,p,p_{a}) = k_{\eta}(\eta)u(T,p,p_{a}), \tag{11.130}
$$

where  $k_{\eta}(\eta)$  is the absorption coefficient at some reference condition, and  $u(T,p,p_{a})$  is a nondimensional function depending on local conditions of the gas, but not on wavenumber. This is commonly known as the scaling approximation. Substituting this into equation (11.129) gives

$$
\overline{\tau}_{\eta}(0\to X) = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\exp \left(-k_{\eta}(\eta)\int_{0}^{X}u dX\right)d\eta = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\exp \left(-k_{\eta}\overline{X}\right)d\eta , \tag{11.131}
$$

where  $\overline{X}$  is now a path- integrated value for  $X$ . Comparing with equation (11.96), we find that in this case there is only a single  $k$ - distribution, based on the reference absorption coefficient  $k_{\eta}$ , and

$$
\overline{\tau}_{\eta}(0\to X) = \int_{0}^{1}e^{-k(g)\overline{X}}dg;\qquad \overline{X} = \int_{0}^{X}udX. \tag{11.132}
$$

As for homogeneous media equations (11.129) and (11.132) provide reordered absorption coefficients, which can be used in arbitrary radiation solvers without restrictions. At first glance, equation (11.129) looks superior to equation (11.132), since the assumption of a scaled absorption coefficient is more restrictive. However, in practice one needs to approximate an actual absorption coefficient, which is neither scaled nor correlated: if the scaling method is employed, the scaling function  $u(T,p,p_{a})$  and its reference state for  $k_{\eta}$  can be freely chosen and, thus, optimized for a problem at hand. On the other hand, if the correlated-  $k$  method is used, the absorption coefficient is simply assumed to be correlated (even though it is not), and the inherent error cannot be minimized. Following Modest and Zhang [126] and assuming constant total pressure, reference state temperature  $T_{0}$  and partial pressure  $p_{a0}$  may be chosen from

$$
\begin{array}{c}{p_{a0} = \frac{1}{V}\int_{V}p_{a}dV,}\\ {\overline{\kappa}_{\eta}(T_{0},x_{0})I_{b\eta}(T_{0}) = \frac{1}{V}\int_{V}\overline{\kappa}_{\eta}(T,x)I_{b\eta}(T)dV,} \end{array} \tag{11.133}
$$

where  $\overline{\kappa}_{\eta} = \int_{\Delta \eta}\kappa_{\eta}d\eta /\Delta \eta$  is the average absorption coefficient, i.e., volume- averaged partial pressure and a mean temperature based on average emission from the volume. For the scaling function Modest and Zhang suggest equating exact and approximate radiation leaving from a homogeneous slab of the length under consideration, or

$$
\int_0^1\exp \left[-k(T,p_a,g)L\right]dg = \int_0^1\exp \left[-k(T_0,p_{a0},g)u(T,p,p_a)L\right]dg. \tag{11.135}
$$

Correlated-  $k$  and scaled-  $k$  are about equally efficient numerically: both require evaluation of the local  $k$ - distribution  $k(T,p_{a},g)$  everywhere along the path. As an illustration a simple (yet severe) example is shown in Fig. 11- 20, showing transmissivity through, and emissivity from, a slab of hot gas at  $1000\mathrm{K}$  adjacent to a cold slab at  $300\mathrm{K}$ . Both layers are at the same total and partial pressures, and are of equal width [127]. The transmissivity for a blackbody beam  $I_{b\eta}(T_h = 1000\mathrm{K})$ , through such a double layer is, from Chapter 10,

$$
\overline{\tau}_{\eta} = \frac{I_{\eta}(L)_{\mathrm{tr}}}{I_{b\eta}(T_h)} = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\exp [-\kappa_{\eta}(T_h,x)L_h - \kappa_{\eta}(T_c,x)L_c]d\eta , \tag{11.136}
$$

while the emissivity is defined here as the intensity of emitted radiation exiting the cold layer, as compared to the Planck function of the hot layer. Employing equation (10.29) this is readily evaluated as

$$
\overline{\epsilon}_{\eta} = \frac{I_{\eta}(L)_{\mathrm{em}}}{I_{b\eta}(T_h)} = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\left[e^{-\kappa_{\eta}(T_c,x)L_c} - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}(T_c,x)L_c - \kappa_{\eta}(T_h,x)L_h} + \frac{I_{b\eta}(T_c)}{I_{b\eta}(T_h)}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}(T_c,x)L_c}\right)\right]d\eta . \tag{11.137}
$$

FIGURE 11-20Narrow band transmissivities and emissivities for two-temperature slab, as calculated by the  $\mathrm{LBL}_r$  scaled-  $k,$  and correlated-  $k$  methods: (a)  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  band of  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  with  $p_{\mathrm{CO_2}} = 0.1$  bar, (b)  $6.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band of  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  with  $p_{\mathrm{H_2O}} = 0.2$  bar.

Note that, while transmissivities are more regularly shown in the narrow band literature, the emissivity is generally more descriptive of heat transfer problems. Figure 11- 20a shows these narrow band transmissivities and emissivities for the  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  band of  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  for a partial pressure of  $p_{\mathrm{CO_2}} = 0.1$  bar, as calculated by the  $\mathrm{LBL}_r$  scaled-  $k,$  and correlated-  $k$  methods, using the original HITEMP 1995 database [62], and all for a resolution of  $\Delta \eta = 5\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  (lines) and  $25\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  (symbols). Both correlated and scaled  $k$  - distributions predict transmissivity very accurately with the exception of small discrepancies near the minima at  $3600\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  and  $3700\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . Similar errors also show up in the emissivity, but are somewhat amplified. This amplification was observed for all bands studied (i.e., the effect is not limited to regions of small emissivities, as in this figure). For both, transmissivity and emissivity, results from the two  $k$  - distributions are virtually identical, although correlated-  $k$  performs slightly better for the  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  band (in the case of the  $4.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band, not shown, roles are reversed and scaled-  $k$  slightly outperforms correlated-  $k$ ). Figure 11- 20b shows transmissivities and emissivities for the wide  $6.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  water vapor band. Conditions are the same as for Fig. 11- 20a, except that  $p_{\mathrm{H_2O}} = 0.2$  bar and only a  $\Delta \eta = 25\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  resolution is shown (a resolution of  $5\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  results in a very irregular shape which, while the  $k$  - distributions follow this behavior accurately, makes them difficult to compare). Again, both  $k$  - distributions predict transmissivities rather accurately, and the slight errors are somewhat amplified in the emissivities. And, again, both  $k$  - distributions give virtually the same results, with scaled-  $k$  being a little more accurate for this band. In summary, one may say that both models perform about equally well; this implies that—for narrow bands and for temperatures not exceeding  $1000\mathrm{K}$ —the absorption coefficients for water vapor and carbon dioxide are relatively well correlated. Note also that the present case, with a sharp step in temperature, is rather extreme; accuracy can be expected to be significantly better in more realistic combustion systems.

Unfortunately, for nonhomogeneous media with even more extreme temperature gradients the correlation between  $k$  - distributions at different temperatures breaks down. The reason for this is that different lines can have vastly different temperature dependence through the exponential term in equations (11.32): at low temperatures lines near the band center are strongest (with largest  $\kappa_{\eta}$ ), while at high temperatures lines away from the band center exhibit the largest  $\kappa_{\eta}$ . Since the correlated  $k$  - distribution pairs values of equal absorption coefficients, this results in pairing wrong spectral values in hot and cold regions. This is not only true for wide spectral ranges, but also on a narrow band level, since a vibration- rotation band consists of

many slightly displaced subbands, generated by different levels of vibrational energies (different  $B_{v}$ ), some of which undergo transitions only at elevated temperatures [large values for  $E_{l}$  in equation (11.32)], known as "hot lines." For more detail the reader may want to consult the monograph by Taine and Soufiani [4]. The lack of correlation in nonisothermal media was first recognized by Rivière and coworkers [118- 120], who devised the so- called "fictitious gas technique": starting with a high- resolution database, they grouped lines according to the values of their lower energy levels,  $E_{j} = hcB_{v}j(j + 1)$  (i.e., according to their temperature dependence), found the  $k$ - distribution for each of the fictitious gases and, in a further approximation, estimated the gas transmissivity as the product of the transmissivities of the fictitious gases,

$$
\overline{\tau}_{\eta} = \prod_{i = 1}^{n_g}\int_0^{1}\exp \left[-\int_0^X k_i(g,X)dX\right]dg, \tag{11.138}
$$

where  $n_{g}$  is the number of fictitious gases. A very similar approach was taken by Bharadwaj and Modest [109], employing the fictitious gas approach applied to  $k$ - distributions obtained from the Malkmus model. Unfortunately, these methods can only supply the mean transmissivity for a gas layer, i.e., they lose all the advantages of the  $k$ - distributions, and are limited in their application in the same way as the statistical narrow band models.

# Comparison of  $k$ -Distributions and Statistical Models

The  $k$ - distribution method has a number of important advantages over the statistical narrow band models, although the statistical models, in particular the Malkmus model combined with the Curtis- Godson scaling approximation, outperform  $k$ - distributions in a couple of respects:

1. Perhaps the greatest advantage that  $k$ -distributions have is that they formulate radiative properties in terms of a (reordered) absorption coefficient. This implies that radiative heat transfer rates may be calculated using any desired solution method for the radiative transfer equation. If based on exact line-by-line property data, the method is essentially exact (for a homogeneous medium). Statistical narrow band models, on the other hand, calculate gas column transmissivity, and heat transfer rates can only be determined in terms of these transmissivities. 
2. Statistical narrow band models are, due to the transmissivity approach, limited to application in black enclosures without scattering. No such restriction is necessary for  $k$ -distributions (as long as wall reflectance and scattering properties remain constant across the narrow band). 
3. The  $k$ -distribution method is valid for spectral lines of any shape; statistical narrow band models, on the other hand, are generally limited to Lorentz lines (although some formulations for Doppler and Voigt profiles exist). This is not unimportant, since in combustion applications the lines often have Voigt profiles as seen from Fig. 11-9. 
4. Statistical narrow band models return an explicit expression for averaged transmissivity, while the  $k$ -distribution requires integration (quadrature) over the (reordered) narrow spectrum. On the other hand, the narrow band is limited to several tens of wavenumbers for statistical models (to avoid significant changes in statistical parameters, such as  $\overline{S}$  and  $d$ ), but can span several hundreds of wavenumbers for  $k$ -distributions (only limited by changes in Planck function and, if present, spectral variations of wall emittances and scattering properties). 
5. Neither method treats nonhomogeneous paths to complete satisfaction. In fields with moderate temperature gradients and moderate-to-strong pressure variations the correlated-

FIGURE 11-21 The box model for the approximation of total band absorptance.

FIGURE 11- 21 The box model for the approximation of total band absorptance.

$k$  approach performs extremely well, while the Curtis- Godson approximation loses accuracy in the presence of strong pressure variations. On the other hand, in fields with extreme temperature fields all methods have some problems; under such conditions only the correlated-  $k$ , fictitious- gas approach performs well. However, the fictitious- gas approach calculates gas layer transmissivities only, i.e., it is under the same limitations as the statistical methods.

# 11.10 WIDE BAND MODELS

The heat transfer engineer is usually only interested in obtaining heat fluxes or divergences of heat fluxes integrated over the entire spectrum. Therefore, it is desirable to have models that can more readily predict the total absorption or emission from an entire band as was done in Example 11.3. These models are known as wide band models since they treat the spectral range of the entire band.

It is theoretically possible to use quantum mechanical relations, such as equations (11.33), to accurately predict the radiative behavior of entire bands. This has been attempted by Greif and coworkers [128, 129] in a series of papers. While such calculations are more accurate, they tend to be too involved, so simpler methods are sought for practical applications.

# The Box Model

In this very simple model the band is approximated by a rectangular box of width  $\Delta \eta_{e}$  (the effective band width) and height  $\overline{\kappa}$  as shown in Fig. 11- 21. With these assumptions we can calculate the total band absorptance for a homogeneous gas layer as

$$
A\equiv \int_{\mathrm{band}}\epsilon_{\eta}d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}x}\right)d\eta = \Delta \eta_{e}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}x}\right), \tag{11.139}
$$

where both  $\Delta \eta_{e}$  and  $\overline{\kappa}$  may be functions of temperature and pressure. The box model was developed by Penner [20] and successfully applied to diatomic gases. However, the determination of the effective band width is something of a "black art." Once  $\Delta \eta_{e}$  has been found (by using the somewhat arbitrary criterion given by Penner [20] or some other means),  $\overline{\kappa}$  may be related to the band intensity  $\alpha$ , defined as

$$
\alpha \equiv \int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta}d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{S}{d}\right)_{\eta}d\eta , \tag{11.140}
$$

leading to

$$
\overline{\kappa} = \alpha /\Delta \eta_{e}. \tag{11.141}
$$

If the molecular gas layer forms a radiation barrier between two surfaces of unequal temperature, then a suitable choice for the effective band width can give quite reasonable results. However,

![](images/caa319dbb7bb5a587c8072b9154bde0513fecc9a56c3136ea3790976fc34657d.jpg)  
FIGURE 11-22 Band shapes for exponential wide band model.

if emission from a hot gas is considered, then the results become very sensitive to the correct choice of  $\Delta \eta_{e}$ . Nevertheless, the box model—because of its great simplicity—enjoys considerable popularity for use in heat transfer models (see Chapter 20).

Example 11.6. Calculate the effective band width  $\Delta \eta_{e}$  for which the box model predicts the correct total band absorptance for Example 11.3.

# Solution

Integrating equation (11.83) over the entire band gives  $\alpha = (S / d)_0\times \omega = 500\mathrm{cm}^{- 2}$  and  $\overline{\kappa} X = \alpha X / \Delta \eta_{e} =$ $10,000\mathrm{cm}^{- 1} / \Delta \eta_{e}$  . Equation (11.139) then, with  $A = 264.7\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  , results in  $\Delta \eta_{e} = 264.7\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  by trial and error.  $\Delta \eta_{e}$  is seen to be substantially larger than  $\omega$  and essentially equal to  $A_{r}$  because the band in this example is optically very thick. Even in the band wings far away from the band center the band is optically opaque (  $\tau \gg 1$  ). This result must be accounted for in the choice of  $\Delta \eta_{e}$  . For optically thick gases finding the correct  $\Delta \eta_{e}$  is equivalent to finding  $A$  itself. Drawing a box seemingly best approximating the actual band shape can lead to large errors!

# The Exponential Wide Band Model

The exponential wide band model, first developed by Edwards and Menard [130], is by far the most successful of the wide band models. The original model has been further developed in a series of papers by Edwards and coworkers [131- 134]. The word "successful" here implies that the model is able to correlate experimental data for band absorptances with an average error of approximately  $\pm 20\%$  (but with maximum errors as high as  $50\%$  to  $80\%$ ). We present here the latest version of Edwards, together with its terminology (based on Goody's narrow band model), followed by a short discussion of newer models by Felske and Tien [135] (Goody's model) and Wang [136] (Malkmus' model). For a more exhaustive discussion on Edwards' model the reader may want to consult Edwards' monograph on gas radiation [1].

Since it is known from quantum mechanics that the line strength decreases exponentially in the band wings far away from the band center, Edwards assumed that the smoothed absorption coefficient  $S / d$  has one of the following three shapes, as shown in Fig. 11- 22:

with upper limit head

$$
\frac{S}{d} = \frac{\alpha}{\omega} e^{-(\eta_u - \eta) / \omega}, \tag{11.142a}

\frac{S}{d} = \frac{\alpha}{\omega} e^{-2|\eta_c - \eta | / \omega}, \tag{11.142b}

$$
\frac{S}{d} = \frac{\alpha}{\omega} e^{-(\eta -\eta_{l}) / \omega}, \tag{11.142c}
$$

where  $\alpha$  is the integrated absorption coefficient or the band strength parameter (or area under the curves in Fig. 11- 22), which was defined in equation (11.140), and  $\omega$  is the band width parameter, giving the width of the band at  $1 / e$  of maximum intensity. The band can be expected to be fairly symmetric if, during rotational energy changes, the  $B$  does not change too much [recall equations (11.28a) through (11.28c)].  $\eta_{c}$  is then the wavenumber connected with the vibrational transition. On the other hand, if the change in  $B$  is substantial, then either the  $R$ - or the  $P$ - branch may fold back, leading to bands with upper or lower head. Thus, the wavenumbers  $\eta_{u}$  and  $\eta_{l}$  are the wavenumbers where this folding back occurs, and not the band center. The sharp exponential apex is, of course, not very realistic. The rationale is that, if the band center is optically thick, then it is opaque no matter what the shape, while if it is thin, then only the total  $\alpha$  is of importance. Edwards and Menard [130] proceeded to evaluate the band absorptance using the general statistical model by substituting expressions (11.142) into equation (11.78) and carrying out the integration in an approximate fashion. Since equation (11.78) contains the line overlap parameter  $\beta$  and the optical thickness  $\tau$ , the authors were able to describe the total band absorptance as a function of three parameters, namely,

$$
A^{*} = A / \omega = A^{*}(\alpha ,\beta ,\tau_{0}), \tag{11.143}
$$

where  $\tau_{0}$  is the optical thickness at the band center (symmetric band) or the band head. Their results are summarized in Table 11.2.10

Example 11.7. Determine the total band absorptance of the previous two examples by the exponential wide band model.

# Solution

From Example 11.3 we have  $\tau_{0} = 200$  and  $\beta = \pi /10$ . Thus, since  $\tau_{0} > 1 / \beta$ , we find from Table 11.2  $A^{*} = \ln (\tau_{0}\beta) + 2 - \beta = \ln (200\times \pi /10) + 2 - \pi /10 = 5.826$  and  $A = A^{*}\omega = 5.826\times 50 = 291.3\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . The difference between the two results is primarily due to the fact that in Example 11.3 we treated the optically thin band wings as optically thick.

The parameters  $\alpha ,\beta ,$  and  $\omega$  are functions of temperature and must be determined experimentally. Values for the most important combustion gases-  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O},$ $\mathrm{CO}_{2},$  CO,  $\mathrm{CH_4},$  NO, and

$\mathrm{SO}_2$  for a reference temperature of  $T_0 = 100\mathrm{K}$  are given in Table 11.3. Most of these correlation data are based on work by Edwards and coworkers and are summarized in [1]. Data for the purely rotational band of  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  have been taken from the more modern work of Modak [137]. Values for other bands and other gases may be found in the literature, e.g., for  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ ,  $\mathrm{CO}_2$ , and  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  [1, 131, 134, 138- 142], for  $\mathrm{CO}$  [1, 131, 134, 143- 145], for  $\mathrm{SO}_2$  [1, 134, 146], for  $\mathrm{NH}_3$  [147], for  $\mathrm{NO}$  [148], for  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  [149], and for  $\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_2$  [150] (in the older of these references the parameters for the slightly different original model are given; in a number of papers a pressure path length has been used instead of a density path length). The temperature dependence of the band correlation parameters for vibration- rotation bands is given by Edwards [1] as

$$
\alpha (T) = \alpha_{0}\frac{\Psi(T)}{\Psi(T_{0})}, \tag{11.144}
$$

$$
\beta (T) = \beta^{*}P_{e} = \beta_{0}^{*}\sqrt{\frac{T_{0}}{T}\frac{\Phi(T)}{\Phi(T_{0})}} P_{e}, \tag{11.145}
$$

$$
\omega (T) = \omega_{0}\sqrt{\frac{T}{T_{0}}}, \tag{11.146}
$$

and

$$
P_{e} = \left[\frac{p}{p_{0}}\left(1 + (b - 1)\frac{p_{a}}{p}\right)\right]^{n},\quad (p_{0} = 1\mathrm{atm},T_{0} = 100\mathrm{K}), \tag{11.147}
$$

where

$$
\Psi (T) = \left\{1 - \exp \left(\sum_{k = 1}^{m}u_{k}(T)\delta_{k}\right)\right\} \frac{\prod_{k = 1}^{m}\sum_{v_{k} = v_{0,k}}^{\infty}\frac{(v_{k} + g_{k} + |\delta_{k}| - 1)!}{(g_{k} - 1)!v_{k}!}e^{-u_{k}(T)v_{k}}}{\prod_{k = 1}^{m}\sum_{v_{k} = 0}^{\infty}\frac{(v_{k} + g_{k} - 1)!}{(g_{k} - 1)!v_{k}!}e^{-u_{k}(T)v_{k}}}, \tag{11.148}
$$

$$
\Phi (T) = \frac{\left\{\prod_{k = 1}^{m}\sum_{v_k = v_{0,k}}^{\infty}\sqrt{\frac{(v_k + g_k + |\delta_k| - 1)!}{(g_k - 1)!v_k!}e^{-u_k(T)v_k}}\right\}^2}{\prod_{k = 1}^{m}\sum_{v_k = v_{0,k}}^{\infty}\frac{(v_k + g_k + |\delta_k| - 1)!}{(g_k - 1)!v_k!}e^{-u_k(T)v_k}}, \tag{11.149}
$$

and

$$
u_{k}(T) = hcn_{k} / kT,\quad v_{0,k} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0 & \mathrm{for}\quad \delta_{k}\geq 0,\\ |\delta_{k}| & \mathrm{for}\quad \delta_{k}\leq 0. \end{array} \right. \tag{11.150}
$$

In these rather complicated expressions the  $v_{k}$  are vibrational quantum numbers,  $\delta_{k}$  is the change in vibrational quantum number during transition (±1 for a fundamental band, etc.), and the  $g_{k}$  are statistical weights for the transition (degeneracy = number of ways the transition can take place). Values for the  $\eta_{k}, \delta_{k}$ , and  $g_{k}$  are given in Table 11.3. The effective pressure  $P_{e}$  gives the pressure dependence of line broadening due to collisions of absorbing molecules with other absorbing molecules and with nonabsorbing molecules that may be present (for example, nitrogen and other inert gases contained in a mixture). Note that the definition for  $P_{e}$  is slightly different here from equation (11.39) (this was done for empirical reasons, to achieve better agreement with experimental data). For the case of nonnegative  $\delta_{k}$  or  $v_{0,k} = 0$  (the majority of gas bands listed in Table 11.3), the series in the expression for  $\Psi$  and the denominator of  $\Phi$  may be simplified [98] to

$$
\sum_{v_k = 0}^{\infty}\frac{(v_k + g_k + \delta_k - 1)!}{(g_k - 1)!v_k!} e^{-u_kv_k} = \frac{(g_k + \delta_k - 1)!}{(g_k - 1)!} (1 - e^{-u_k})^{-g_k - \delta_k}. \tag{11.151}

a For the rotational band  $\alpha = \alpha_{0}\exp \left(-9(\sqrt{T_{0} / T} -1)\right)$ $\beta^{*} = \beta_{0}^{*}\sqrt{T_{0} / T}$  b Combination of three bands, all but weak (0, 2, 0) band are fundamental bands,  $\alpha_{0} = 25.9\mathrm{cm}^{-1} / (\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{m}^{2})$  . Line overlap for overlapping bands from equation (11.154). d "Hot bands," very weak at room temperature, exponential growth in strength at high temperatures.

$$
\begin{array}{r}\alpha = \alpha_0\frac{\Psi}{\Psi_0},\quad \omega = \omega_0\sqrt{\frac{T}{T_0}},\quad \beta = \beta^* P_e = \beta_0^*\sqrt{\frac{T_0}{T}}\frac{\Phi}{\Phi_0} P_e,\quad P_e = \left[\frac{p}{p_0}\left(1 + (b - 1)\frac{p_e}{p}\right)\right]^n. \end{array}
$$

$\Psi$  from equations (11.144) and (11.148),  $\Phi$  from equation (11.149),  $T_0 = 100 \mathrm{K}$ ,  $p_0 = 1 \mathrm{atm}$ .

If  $v_{0,k} \neq 0$ , then  $v_{0,k}$  terms need to be subtracted from the above result.

Because of the low reference temperature of  $T_{0} = 100\mathrm{K},$  the values for  $u_{0,k}$  are relatively large, so both  $\Phi_0$  and  $\Psi_0$  are very simple to evaluate and, for  $v_{0,k} = 0$

$$
\Psi_{0}\approx \prod_{k = 1}^{m}\frac{(g_{k} + \delta_{k} - 1)!}{(g_{k} - 1)!},\quad \Phi_{0}\approx 1. \tag{11.152}
$$

If only one of the vibrational modes undergoes a transition (only one  $v_{k} \neq 0$ ), then all other modes cancel out of the expression for  $\Psi$ ; and if the transition results in a fundamental band (single transition with  $\delta_{k} = 1$ ), then  $\Psi \equiv 1$ . This implies that, for a fundamental band,  $\alpha (T) = \alpha_{0} =$  const. Unfortunately, the temperature dependence of the broadening mechanism is always more complicated, and  $\Phi$  must generally be evaluated from equation (11.149).

If several bands overlap each other (e.g., the three  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  bands situated around  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$ ), then also the individual lines overlap lines from other bands, resulting in an effective overlap parameter  $\beta$  that is larger than for any of the individual bands. The band strength and overlap parameter for overlapping bands are calculated [1] from

$$
\begin{array}{l}\alpha = \sum_{j = 1}^{J}\alpha_{j},\\ \displaystyle \beta = \frac{1}{\alpha}\left[\sum_{j = 1}^{J}\sqrt{\alpha_{j}\beta_{j}}\right]^{2}, \end{array} \tag{11.153}
$$

where  $J$  is the number of overlapping bands.

When the exponential wide band model was first presented by Edwards and Menard, the temperature dependence for the broadening parameter was not calculated by quantum statistics but was rather correlated from experimental data that, because of their scatter, generally resulted in fairly simple formulae; but extrapolation to higher temperatures tended to be very inaccurate. Most of the bands listed in Table 11.3 are fundamental bands, not because calculations for these bands are simpler, but because fundamental bands tend to be much stronger than overtones or combined- mode bands, often making them the only important ones for heat transfer calculations.

To facilitate hand calculations, the temperature dependence of band strength parameters  $\alpha$  (for nonfundamental bands) and overlap parameters  $\beta^{*}$  are shown in graphical form in Fig. 11- 23 for water vapor. A similar plot is given in Fig. 11- 24 for the important bands of carbon dioxide, and Fig. 11- 25 shows the temperature dependence of the line overlap parameter for the fundamental bands of methane and carbon monoxide (with  $\alpha = \alpha_{0} =$  const). For more accurate computer calculations the subroutines wbmh2o, wbmco2, wbmch4, wbmco, wbmno, and wbmso2 are given in Appendix F. Alternatively, very accurate polynomial fits for these functions have been given by Lailemant and Weber [151].

Example 11.8. Consider a water vapor- air mixture at 3 atm and  $600\mathrm{K}$ , with  $5\%$  water vapor by volume. What is the most important  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  band and what is its total band absorptance for a path of  $10\mathrm{cm}$ ?

# Solution

At  $600\mathrm{K}$  the Planck function has its maximum around  $5\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Since total emission will depend on the blackbody intensity [see equation (11.58)], we seek a band with large  $\alpha$  in the vicinity of  $5\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Inspection of Table 11.3 shows that the strongest vibration- rotation band for water vapor lies at  $6.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  and is, therefore, the band we are interested in. From the table we find  $\alpha = \alpha_{0} = 41.2\mathrm{cm}^{- 1} / (\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{m}^{2})$ ,  $\beta = \beta_{0}^{*}\sqrt{T_{0} / T(\Phi / \Phi_{0})} P_{e}$  with  $\beta_{0}^{*} = 0.094$ , and  $\omega = \omega_{0}\sqrt{T / T_{0}} = 56.4\sqrt{600 / 100} = 138.15\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . To evaluate the effective broadening pressure we find  $n = 1$  and  $b = 8.6\sqrt{100 / 600} + 0.5 = 4.01$  and with a volume fraction  $x = p_{a} / p$  the effective pressure becomes  $P_{e} = \{(p / 1\mathrm{atm})[1 + (b - 1)x]\}^{n} = 3[1 + 3.01\times 0.05] = 3.452$ . Estimating the temperature dependence of the line overlap parameter from Fig. 11- 23 leads to  $\beta^{*} / \beta_{0}^{*} \simeq 0.65$  and

FIGURE 11-24 Temperature dependence of line overlap parameter,  $\beta^*$ , and band strength parameter,  $\alpha$ , for carbon dioxide.

$\beta = 0.094\times 0.65\times 3.452 = 0.211$  . Since all values for  $\alpha$  in Table 11.3 are based on a mass absorption coefficient, we must calculate  $X$  as  $X = \rho_{a}s,$  where  $\rho_{a}$  is the partial density of the absorbing gas (not the density of the gas mixture). For our water vapor with a partial pressure of  $\rho_{a} = 0.05\times 3 = 0.15$  atm and a molecular weight of  $\mathcal{M} = 18\mathrm{g / mol},$  we get from the ideal gas law

$$
\rho_{a} = \frac{\mathcal{M}\rho_{a}}{R_{u}T} = \frac{18\mathrm{g / mol}\times 0.15\mathrm{atm}}{8.3145\mathrm{J / mol}\mathrm{K}\times 600\mathrm{K}}\frac{1.0132\times 10^{5}\mathrm{J / m^{3}}}{1\mathrm{atm}} = 54.84\mathrm{g / m^{3}}
$$

and  $X = 54.84\times 0.1 = 5.48\mathrm{g / m^2}$  . Finally, from  $\tau_0 = \alpha X / \omega$  we get  $\tau_0 = 41.2\times 5.48 / 138.15 = 1.634$  . Since the value of  $\tau_0$  lies between the values of  $\beta$  and  $1 / \beta$  we are in the square- root regime and

$$
A^{*} = 2\sqrt{\tau_{0}\beta} -\beta = 2\sqrt{1.634\times 0.211} -0.211 = 0.964
$$

or  $A = 0.964\times 138.15 = 133\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$

FIGURE 11-25 Temperature dependence of the line overlap parameter,  $\beta^{*}$ , for the fundamental bands of methane and carbon monoxide.

The calculation of exact values for  $\Phi$  and  $\Psi$  for nonfundamental bands is rather tedious and is best left to computer calculations with the subroutines given in Appendix F.

While the correlation in Table 11.2 is simple and straightforward (aside from the temperature dependence of  $\alpha$  and  $\beta$ ), it is often preferable to have a single continuous correlation formula. A simple analytical expression can be obtained for the high- pressure limit, i.e., when the lines become very wide from broadening resulting in very strong overlap, or  $\beta \rightarrow \infty$ , leading to  $\kappa_{\eta} = (\overline{S} /d)_{\eta}$  and

$$
A^{*} = E_{1}(\tau_{0}) + \ln \tau_{0} + \gamma_{E} = \mathrm{Ein}(\tau_{0}),\qquad \beta \to \infty , \tag{11.155}
$$

where  $E_{1}(\tau)$  is known as an exponential integral function, which is discussed in some detail in Appendix E. Felske and Tien [135] have given a formula for all ranges of  $\beta$ , based on results from the numerical quadrature of equation (11.78):

$$
A^{*} = 2E_{1}\left(\sqrt{\frac{\tau_{0}\beta}{1 + \beta / \tau_{0}}}\right) + E_{1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\tau_{0} / \beta}{1 + \beta / \tau_{0}}}\right) - E_{1}\left(\frac{1 + 2\beta}{2}\sqrt{\frac{\tau_{0} / \beta}{1 + \beta / \tau_{0}}}\right) + \ln \left(\frac{\tau_{0}\beta}{(1 + \beta / \tau_{0})(1 + 2\beta)}\right) + 2\gamma_{E}, \tag{11.156}
$$

or, more compactly,

$$
A^{*} = 2\operatorname {Ein}(w) + \operatorname {Ein}\left(\frac{w}{2\beta}\right) - \operatorname {Ein}\left(\left[\frac{1}{2\beta} +1\right]w\right),\quad w = \left(\frac{\overline{W}}{d}\right)_{0,\mathrm{Goody}} = \frac{\tau_{0}}{\sqrt{1 + \tau_{0} / \beta}}. \tag{11.157}
$$

A previous, somewhat simpler expression by Tien and Lowder [152] is known today to be seriously in error for small values of  $\beta$  [135, 153], and is not recommended.

Edwards' wide band model, given in Table 11.2, as well as the continuous correlation by Felske and Tien, are based on equation (11.70) together with Goody's statistical model, equation (11.78), the best narrow band model available at the time of Edwards and Menard's [130] original paper. Since then it has been found that the Malkmus model introduced in 1967, equation (11.79), describes the radiative behavior of most gases better than Goody's model [104]. It was shown by Wang [136] that an exact closed- form solution for the band absorptance can be

![](images/42cc89d1ebf5317b5cc6c806ca5659687f5b9b08ea44dffe269ed1c2d148e396.jpg)  
FIGURE 11-26 Comparison of various band absorptance correlations.

found, if equation (11.142) is combined with Malkmus' narrow band model, leading to

$$
A^{*} = e^{\beta}\left[E_{1}(\beta +w) - E_{1}(\beta)\right] + \ln (1 + w / \beta) + \mathrm{Ein}(w),\quad w = \left(\frac{\overline{W}}{d}\right)_{0,\mathrm{Malkmu}} = \frac{\beta}{2}\left[\sqrt{1 + 4\tau_{0} / \beta} -1\right].
$$

Results from Wang's model, equation (11.158), are compared in Fig. 11- 26 with those of Edwards and Menard, Table 11.2, and Felske and Tien, equation (11.156). The agreement between all three models is good. However, the band absorptance based on Malkmus' model, equation (11.158), is always slightly below that predicted by Goody's model, equation (11.156). Both the Felske and Tien and the Wang models go to the correct strong- overlap limit  $(\beta \rightarrow \infty)$ , equation (11.155), while the older Edwards and Menard model shows its more approximate character, substantially overpredicting band absorptances for large  $\beta$ , particularly for intermediate values of  $\tau_0$ .

A considerable number of other band correlations are available in the literature, based on numerous variations of the Elsasser and statistical models. An exhaustive discussion of the older (up to 1978) correlations and their accuracies (as compared with numerical quadrature results based on the plain Elsasser and the general statistical models) has been given by Tiwari [154].

Example 11.9. Repeat Example 11.8, using the Felske and Tien and the Wang models.

# Solution

All relations developed for Edwards and Menard's model, equations (11.144) through (11.147), are equally valid for these two models, as are the data in Table 11.3. Thus, we have again  $\tau_0 = 1.634$  and  $\beta = 0.211$ . Sticking these numbers into equations (11.156) and (11.158) (or, rather, using the Fortran functions ftwbm and wangwbm, or the stand- alone program wbmodel1s, all supplied in Appendix F) gives

$$
A_{\mathrm{FT}}^{*} = 0.6916,\qquad A_{\mathrm{Wang}}^{*} = 0.6427.
$$

As expected, the results are fairly close to each other, with the Malkmus- based Wang correlation predicting an about  $7\%$  lower band absorptance. Both values are significantly lower than those predicted by Edwards and Menard's model, which—as inspection of Fig. 11- 26 shows—considerably overpredicts band absorptances for strong line overlap (large  $\beta$ ) at intermediate optical thicknesses  $\tau_0$ .

# Wide Band Model for Nonhomogeneous Gases

As indicated in the previous section on narrow band models, the spectral emissivity for a nonhomogeneous path (with varying temperature and/or gas pressures) [cf. equation (11.61)] is

$$
\epsilon_{\eta} = 1 - \exp \Bigl (-\int_{0}^{X}\kappa_{\eta}dX\Bigr), \tag{11.159}
$$

from which we may calculate the total band absorptance as

$$
A = \int_{0}^{\infty}\epsilon_{\eta}d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}\left[1 - \exp \left(-\int_{0}^{X}\kappa_{\eta}dX\right)\right]d\eta . \tag{11.160}
$$

Here we have replaced the geometric path  $s$  by  $X$  in case a linear absorption coefficient is not used, but rather one based on density (as was done for the correlation parameters in Table 11.3) or pressure. Since we would still like to use the simple wide band model, appropriate path- averaged values for the correlation parameters  $\alpha , \beta ,$  and  $\omega$  must be found. Attempts at such scaling were made by Chan and Tien [155], Cess and Wang [156], and Edwards and Morizumi [157], and are summarized by Edwards [1]. The average value for  $\alpha$  follows readily from the weak line limit (linear regime in Table 11.2) as

$$
\widetilde{\alpha}\equiv \frac{1}{X}\int_{0}^{X}\int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta}d\eta dX = \frac{1}{X}\int_{0}^{X}\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{S}{d}\right)_{\eta}d\eta dX = \frac{1}{X}\int_{0}^{X}\alpha dX. \tag{11.161}
$$

The definition of an average value for  $\omega$  is

$$
\widetilde{\omega}\equiv \frac{1}{\alpha X}\int_{0}^{X}\omega \alpha dX, \tag{11.162}
$$

while the averaged value for  $\beta$  is found by comparison with the square root regime in Table 11.2 as

$$
\widetilde{\beta}\equiv \frac{1}{\omega\widetilde{\alpha}X}\int_{0}^{X}\beta \omega \alpha dX. \tag{11.163}
$$

There is little theoretical justification for the choice of  $\widetilde{\omega}$  and  $\widetilde{\beta},^{11}$  but comparison with spectral calculations using equations (11.90), (11.94), and (11.78) showed that they give excellent results [157].

Example 11.10. Reconsider Example 11.8, but assume that the water vapor- air mixture temperature varies linearly between  $400\mathrm{K}$  and  $800\mathrm{K}$  over its path of  $10\mathrm{cm}$ . How does this affect the total band absorptance for the  $6.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band?

# Solution

We may express the temperature variation as  $T = 400\mathrm{K}(1 + s^{\prime} / s)$ , where  $s^{\prime}$  is distance along path  $s$ , and the density variation as

$$
\rho_{a} = \rho_{600}\frac{600\mathrm{K}}{T} = 6\rho_{600}\frac{T_{0}}{T} = \frac{\frac{3}{2}\rho_{600}}{1 + s^{\prime} / s}.
$$

Thus,

$$
X = \int_{0}^{s}\rho_{a}ds^{\prime} = 6\rho_{600}\int_{0}^{s}\left(\frac{T_{0}}{T}\right)ds^{\prime} = \frac{3}{2}\rho_{600}s\int_{0}^{1}\frac{d\xi}{1 + \xi} = \frac{3}{2} X_{600}\ln 2 = 1.040X_{600} = 5.702\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{m}^{2}.
$$

The path- averaged band strength becomes

$$
\widetilde{\alpha} = \frac{1}{X}\int_{0}^{s}\alpha \rho_{a}ds = \frac{1}{X}\alpha_{0}X = \alpha_{0} = 41.2\mathrm{cm}^{-1} / (\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{m}^{2}),
$$

since the  $6.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band is a fundamental band and  $\alpha$  is independent of temperature. For the averaged  $\widetilde{\omega}$  we get, from  $\omega = \omega_{0}\sqrt{T / T_{0}} = \omega_{0}\sqrt{4}\sqrt{1 + s^{\prime} / s},$

$$
\begin{array}{r l r} & {} & {\widetilde{\omega} = \frac{1}{\widetilde{\alpha}X}\int_{0}^{s}\omega \alpha \rho_{a}d s^{\prime} = \frac{6\omega_{0}\rho_{600}}{X}\int_{0}^{s}\sqrt{\frac{T}{T_{0}}}\frac{T_{0}}{T} d s^{\prime} = \frac{3\omega_{0}\rho_{600}}{X}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{d\xi}{\sqrt{1 + \xi}}}\\ & {} & {= \frac{3\omega_{0}X_{600}}{X}\times 2\sqrt{1 + \xi}\Big|_{0}^{1} = 6\big(\sqrt{2} -1\big)\frac{X_{600}}{X}\omega_{0} = \frac{6\big(\sqrt{2} - 1\big)}{\frac{3}{2}\ln 2}\times 56.4\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}\\ & {} & {= 134.8\mathrm{cm}^{-1}.} \end{array}
$$

And, finally, the overlap parameter is obtained from

$$
\begin{array}{l}\widetilde{\beta} = \frac{1}{\widetilde{\omega}\widetilde{\alpha}X}\int_{0}^{s}\beta \omega \alpha \rho_{a}ds^{\prime} = \frac{6\rho_{600}}{\widetilde{\omega}X}\int_{0}^{s}\left(\beta_{0}^{*}P_{e}\frac{\beta^{*}}{\beta_{0}^{*}}\right)\left(\omega_{0}\sqrt{\frac{T}{T_{0}}}\right)\left(\frac{T_{0}}{T}\right)ds^{\prime}\\ = 6\beta_{0}^{*}P_{e}\frac{\omega_{0}}{\widetilde{\omega}}\frac{X_{600}}{X}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{\beta^{*}}{\beta_{0}^{*}}\sqrt{\frac{T_{0}}{T}} d\xi^{\prime}. \end{array}
$$

Inspection of Fig. 11- 23 reveals that the integrand varies between  $0.59 / \sqrt{8} \simeq 0.30$  (at  $400\mathrm{K}$ ), to  $0.66 / \sqrt{6} \simeq 0.27$  (at  $600\mathrm{K}$ ), back to  $0.80 / \sqrt{8} \simeq 0.29$  (at  $800\mathrm{K}$ ); i.e., the integrand is relatively constant. Keeping in mind the inherent inaccuracies of the wide band model, the integral may be approximated by using an average value of 0.28. Then

$$
\widetilde{\beta}\simeq 0.28\times 6\beta_{0}^{*}P_{e}\frac{\omega_{0}}{\widetilde{\omega}}\frac{X_{600}}{X} = \frac{0.28\times 6\beta_{0}^{*}P_{e}}{6\left(\sqrt{2} - 1\right)} = \frac{0.28\times 0.09427\times 3.4515}{\sqrt{2} - 1} = 0.220.
$$

The effective optical thickness at the band center is now

$$
\tau_{0} = \widetilde{\alpha} X / \widetilde{\omega} = 41.2\times 5.702 / 134.8 = 1.743.
$$

Again we are in the square root regime and

$$
A^{*} = 2\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\tau_{0}\beta}} -\widetilde{\beta} = 2\sqrt{1.743\times 0.220} -0.220 = 1.018\mathrm{and}A = 137\mathrm{cm}^{-1}.
$$

Thus, although the temperature varied considerably over the path (by a factor of two) values for  $\alpha , \beta ,$  and  $\omega$  changed only slightly, and the final value for the band absorptance changed by less than  $3\%$ . In view of the accuracy of the wide band correlation, the assumption of an isothermal gas can often lead to satisfactory results. This has been corroborated by Felske and Tien [158], who suggested a linear average for temperature, and a second independent linear average for density (as opposed to density evaluated at average temperature). They found negligible discrepancy for a large number of nonisothermal examples.

# Wide Band  $k$ -Distributions

Wide band models allow us to determine the radiative emission (or the absorption of incoming radiation) from a volume of gas over an entire vibration- rotation band with a single calculation; but they are inherently less accurate than narrow band models, and they have the same limitations, i.e., they are difficult to apply to nonhomogeneous gases, and they cannot be used at all in enclosures that have nonblack walls and/or in the presence of scattering particles.

The  $k$ - distribution method, on the other hand, smoothes the spectrum by simply reordering it, rather than supplying an effective transmissivity, and, therefore, it can readily be applied to nonblack walls as well as to scattering media. For a homogeneous medium the method is essentially exact, even for an entire vibration- rotation band, except for the assumption that the Planck function,  $I_{b\eta}$ , is invariable across the band. This has prompted a number of researchers to generate wide band  $k$ - distributions based on exponential wide band correlation data. The first such  $k$ - distribution was generated by Wang and Shi [159], using the Malkmus narrow band

model together with exponentially decaying average line strength. In order to obtain a finite- range reordered wavenumber,  $0 \leq g \leq 1$ , as was done for narrow band  $k$ - distributions, they truncated the exponentially decaying band wings [see Fig. 11- 22 and equation (11.142b)]. This resulted in an analytical expression for the wide band  $k$ - distribution,  $F(k)$ . However, evaluation of the reordered wavenumber,  $g(k) = \int F dk$ , and its inversion to  $k(g)$  required numerical integration. Marin and Buckius [160] took a very similar approach but used the exponential wide band model together with both the Malkmus model and also the Goody model; they also provided approximate, explicit expressions for water vapor and carbon dioxide [161- 163]. Lee et al. [164, 165] were able to find the  $k$ - distribution directly from wide band correlations, using a rather obscure version of Edwards' model. This approach was further refined by Parthasarathy et al. [166], using Wang's wide band model [136]. Denison and Fiveland [167] also provided closed- form approximations for the cumulative  $k$ - distribution, based on Edwards' original wide band model given in Table 11.2. Comparison with narrow band calculations has shown that results from this model have very respectable accuracy [168].

The band absorptance for a vibration- rotation band is given by equation (11.139). Assuming a symmetric band, such as given by equation (11.142b), and reordering according to Section 11.9 leads to

$$
A = 2\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}X}\right)d\eta \eta -\eta_{c}| = 2\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa X}\right)F(\kappa)d\kappa = 2\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa (g)X}\right)dg, \tag{11.164}
$$

where the  $k$ - distribution

$$
F(\kappa) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\delta (\kappa -\kappa_{\eta})d\eta , \tag{11.165}
$$

is defined over an unbounded (wide band) spectral range  $\Delta \eta \rightarrow \infty$  and, thus,  $g$  is also unbounded [cf. equations (11.98) and (11.101)] and equivalent to  $|\eta - \eta_c|$ . The reordered band can also be regarded as symmetrical, if desired (with  $g$  going into both directions away from  $\eta_c$ ). Nondimensionalizing equation (11.164) gives

$$
\begin{array}{c}{A^{*} = \frac{A}{\omega} = 2\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa^{*}\tau_{0}}\right)F^{*}(\kappa^{*})d\kappa^{*} = \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa^{*}(g^{*})\tau_{0}}\right)dg^{*},}\\ {\tau_{0} = \frac{\alpha}{\omega} X,\quad \kappa^{*} = \frac{\kappa\omega}{\alpha},\quad F^{*} = \frac{\alpha F}{\omega^{2}},\quad g^{*} = 2\frac{g}{\omega}.} \end{array} \tag{11.166}
$$

Differentiating equation (11.166) with respect to  $\tau_0$ , and using Wang's expression for band absorptance, equation (11.158), yields

$$
\frac{dA^{*}}{d\tau_{0}} = \frac{1}{\tau_{0}}\left\{1 - \exp \left[\frac{3}{2}\left(1 - \sqrt{1 + \frac{4\tau_{0}}{\beta}}\right)\right]\right\} = 2\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-\kappa^{*}\tau_{0}}\kappa^{*}F^{*}(\kappa^{*})d\kappa^{*}. \tag{11.167}
$$

Comparing both sides of this equation it is apparent that  $F^{*}(\kappa^{*})$  is related to the inverse Laplace transform of  $dA^{*} / d\tau_{0}$ ,

$$
2\kappa^{*}F^{*}(\kappa^{*}) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left(\frac{dA^{*}}{d\tau_{0}}\right). \tag{11.168}
$$

Using Wang's model an analytical expression can be obtained for the inverse [166]:

$$
F^{*}(\kappa^{*}) = \frac{1}{4\kappa^{*}}\left\{\mathrm{erfc}\left[\frac{\sqrt{\beta}}{2}\left(\sqrt{\kappa^{*}} -\frac{1}{\sqrt{\kappa^{*}}}\right)\right] - e^{\beta}\mathrm{erfc}\left[\frac{\sqrt{\beta}}{2}\left(\sqrt{\kappa^{*}} +\frac{1}{\sqrt{\kappa^{*}}}\right)\right]\right\} . \tag{11.169}
$$

The cumulative  $k$ - distribution  $g^{*}$ , or reordered wavenumber, must be found and inverted numerically from

$$
\int_{\kappa^*}^\infty F^* (\kappa^*)d\kappa^* = \frac{1}{2} g^* = \frac{g}{\omega}. \tag{11.170}
$$

FIGURE 11-27 Nondimensional reordered absorption coefficient  $\kappa^{*}$  for an exponential wide band vs. nondimensional cumulative  $k$ -distribution  $g^{*}$ .

Figure 11- 27 shows the resulting reordered, nondimensional absorption coefficient  $\kappa^{*} \upsilon s$ . artificial, normalized wavenumber  $g^{*}$ . For large values of  $\beta$  there is strong line overlap and  $\kappa_{\eta} \simeq (S / d)_{\eta}$ , and essentially no reordering is necessary. For that case  $F^{*}$  approaches  $F^{*} \rightarrow 1 / 2 \kappa^{*}$  for  $\kappa^{*} < 1$  and  $F^{*} \rightarrow 0$  for  $\kappa^{*} > 1$ , leading to  $\kappa^{*} \rightarrow e^{- g^{*}}$ ,  $g^{*} \gtrsim 0.1$ . For smaller values of  $\beta$ , or less line overlap, but with identical average absorption coefficient the maximum value of the spectral absorption coefficient increases, and fewer spectral positions will have intermediate values, making the distribution more and more compressed toward small  $g^{*}$ , with larger values near  $g^{*} = 0$ .

Example 11.11. The water vapor- air mixture of Example 11.8 is contained in a nonblack furnace of varied dimensions mixed with soot and scattering particles. In order to make accurate predictions of the radiative heat flux possible across the  $6.3 \mu \mathrm{m}$  water vapor band, determine a reordered correlated  $k$ - distribution for this mixture.

# Solution

For the water vapor- air mixture of Example 11.8 we have for the  $6.3 \mu \mathrm{m}$  band  $\alpha = 41.2 \mathrm{~cm}^{- 1} / (\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{m}^{2})$ ,  $\omega = 138.15 \mathrm{~cm}^{- 1}$ ,  $\beta = 0.211$ , and  $\rho_{a} = 54.84 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ . Obtaining a reordered, nondimensional absorption coefficient  $\kappa^{*} = \kappa^{*}(g^{*})$  from equation (11.170) [by utilizing the Fortran subroutine wbmkvsg given in Appendix F], we get from equation (11.166)

$$
\kappa (g) = \kappa (|\eta -\eta_c|) = \frac{\rho_a\alpha}{\omega}\kappa^*\left(\frac{2g}{\omega}\right) = \frac{\rho_a\alpha}{\omega}\kappa^*\left(\frac{2|\eta - \eta_c|}{\omega}\right),
$$

where we have replaced the  $\alpha$  in equation (11.166) by  $\rho_{a} \alpha$  in order to obtain a linear, rather than density- based, absorption coefficient [see equation (11.18)], which is generally preferred for spectral calculations. This equivalent spectral absorption coefficient for the  $6.3 \mu \mathrm{m}$  water vapor band, centered at  $\eta_{c} = 1600 \mathrm{~cm}^{- 1}$ , is shown in Fig. 11- 28, and is compared with the spectral narrow band average absorption coefficient,  $(S / d)_{\eta}$  for the same conditions. Since, for  $\beta = 0.211$ , there is relatively little line overlap, average values  $(S / d)_{\eta}$  must come from strongly varying  $\kappa_{\eta}$  with values much larger and much smaller than the average; thus the abundance of large  $\kappa$  (near  $\eta = \eta_{c}$ ) with a quick drop- off away from the band center.

Figure 11- 28 makes the band appear less wide than indicated by the band width parameter  $\omega$ . This was done for mathematical convenience: as Fig. 11- 11 shows, a band with small  $\beta$

FIGURE 11-28 Reordered absorption coefficient for Example 11.11.

Reordered absorption coefficient for Example 11.11.

contains many strong lines separated by small  $\kappa$ ; we have simply chosen to collect all the large values of  $\kappa$  near the band center.

The wide band  $k$ - distribution presented here requires numerical integration of equation (11.170) and its inversion to obtain the reordered absorption coefficient  $k(g)$ ; the reordered absorption coefficient recovers the total band absorptance as defined by exponential wide band model parameters. On the other hand, in the work of Marin and Buckius [161- 163] explicit (albeit cumbersome) expressions are given for  $k(g)$ , which approximate the wide band  $k$ - distributions obtained from the HITEMP 1995 database [62]. While probably more accurate below  $1000\mathrm{K}$  (the limit of applicability of HITEMP), the Marin and Buckius formulation depends strongly on the arbitrary and nonphysical choice for the cutoff wavenumber (chosen to find a best fit with HITEMP- generated  $k$ - distributions).

# 11.11 TOTAL EMISSIVITY AND MEAN ABSORPTION COEFFICIENT

# Total Emissivity

In less sophisticated, more practical engineering treatment it is usually sufficient to evaluate the emission from a hot gas (usually considered isothermal) that reaches a wall. The total emissivity is defined as the portion of total emitted radiation over a path  $X$  that is not attenuated by self- absorption, divided by the maximum possible emission or, from equation (11.48) and considering only emission within the gas,

$$
\epsilon \equiv \frac{\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}\epsilon_\eta d\eta}{\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}d\eta} = \frac{\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_\eta X}\right)d\eta}{\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}d\eta} = \sum_{i = 1}^N\left(\frac{\pi I_{b\eta 0}}{\sigma T^4}\right)_i\int_{\Delta \eta_{\mathrm{band}}}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_\eta X}\right)d\eta = \sum_{i = 1}^N\left(\frac{\pi I_{b\eta 0}}{\sigma T^4}\right)_iA_i, \tag{11.171}
$$

where two simplifying assumptions have been made: (i) The spectral width of each of the  $N$  bands is so narrow that the Planck function varies only negligibly over this range, and (ii) the bands do not overlap. While the first assumption is generally very good (with the exception of pure rotational bands such as the one for water vapor listed in Table 11.3), bands do sometimes overlap (for example, the  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  bands in a water vapor-  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  mixture).

If two or more bands of the species contained in a gas mixture overlap, the emission from the mixture will be smaller than the sum of the individual contributions (because of increased self- absorption). This problem has been dealt with, in an approximate fashion, by Hottel and Sarofim [11]. They argued that the transmissivities of species  $a$  and  $b$  over the overlapping region  $\Delta \eta$  are independent from one another, that is,

$$
\overline{\tau}_{a + b} = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}e^{-\kappa_{\eta \mu}X}e^{-\kappa_{\eta \nu}X}d\eta \approx \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}e^{-\kappa_{\eta \mu}X}d\eta \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}e^{-\kappa_{\eta \nu}X}d\eta = \overline{\tau}_a\overline{\tau}_b. \tag{11.172}
$$

If we define the total emissivity for a single band as

$$
\epsilon_{i}\equiv \left(\frac{\pi I_{b\eta 0}}{\sigma T^{4}}\right)_{i}A_{i}, \tag{11.173}
$$

then this expression leads to the total emissivity of two overlapping bands, or

$$
\epsilon_{a + b} = \epsilon_{a} + \epsilon_{b} - \epsilon_{a}\epsilon_{b}. \tag{11.174}
$$

This equation is only accurate if both bands fully overlap. If the overlap is only partial, then the correction term,  $\epsilon_{a}\epsilon_{b}$ , should be calculated based on the fractions of band emissivity that pertain to the overlap region (i.e., a quantity that is not available from wide band correlations). An approximate way of dealing with this problem has been suggested by Felske and Tien [158].

A total absorptivity for the gas may be defined in the same way as equation (11.171). However, as for surfaces, in the absorptivity the absorption coefficient must be evaluated at the temperature of the gas, while the Planck function is based on the blackbody temperature of the radiation source.

It is clear from equation (11.171) that the total emissivity is equal to the sum of band absorptances multiplied by the weight factor  $(\pi I_{b\eta 0} / \sigma T^{4})$ . Since the band absorptance is roughly proportional to the band strength parameter  $\alpha$  (exactly proportional for small values of optical path  $X$ ), comparison of the factors  $[\alpha (\pi I_{b\eta 0} / \sigma T^{4})]_{i}$  gives an idea of which bands need to be considered for the calculation of the total emissivity.

Example 11.12. What is the total emissivity of a  $20\mathrm{cm}$  thick layer of pure CO at  $800\mathrm{K}$  and 1 atm?

# Solution

For these conditions CO has a single important absorption band in the infrared. Comparing  $\alpha I_{b\eta 0}$  for the  $4.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $2.35\mu \mathrm{m}$  bands (see Table 11.3) we find with  $(\eta_{0} / T)_{4.3} = 2143\mathrm{cm}^{- 1} / 800\mathrm{K} = 2.679\mathrm{cm}^{- 1} / \mathrm{K}$  and  $(\eta_{0} / T)_{2.35} = 4260\mathrm{cm}^{- 1} / 800\mathrm{K} = 5.325\mathrm{cm}^{- 1} / \mathrm{K},$

$$
(\frac{\alpha E_{b\eta 0}}{T^3})_{4.7}\left / (\frac{\alpha E_{b\eta 0}}{T^3})_{2.35} = \frac{20.9\times 1.5563}{0.14\times 0.2659} = 874.
$$

Therefore, since the  $4.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  band is much stronger  $(\alpha_{4.7} / \alpha_{2.35}\simeq 150)$  and located in a more important part of the spectrum  $\left(E_{b\eta 4.7} / E_{b\eta 2.35}\simeq 6\right)$ , the influence of the  $2.35\mu \mathrm{m}$  band can be neglected. We first need to calculate the band absorptance for the  $4.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  band. Since values in Table 11.3 are based on the mass absorption coefficient, we need to calculate the density of the CO from the ideal gas law, as we did in Example 11.8:

$$
\rho_{a} = \frac{\mathcal{M}\rho_{a}}{R_{a}T} = \frac{28\mathrm{g / mol}\times 1\mathrm{atm}}{8.3145\mathrm{J / mol}\mathrm{K}\times 800\mathrm{K}}\frac{1.0132\times 10^{5}\mathrm{J / m}^{3}}{1\mathrm{atm}} = 426.6\mathrm{g / m}^{3}
$$

and  $X = \rho_{a}s = 85.32\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ . We also find from Table 11.3 that  $n = 0.8$  and  $b = 1.1$ , so that  $P_{e} = 1.1^{0.8} = 1.079$  and  $\beta_{e}^{*}P_{e} = 0.075\times 1.079 = 0.081$ . Further we find  $\alpha = 20.9\mathrm{cm}^{- 1} / (\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{m}^{2})$ ,  $\omega = 25.5\sqrt{800 / 100} = 72.125\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , and  $\tau_{0} = \alpha X / \omega = 20.9\times 85.32 / 72.125 = 24.72$ . From Fig. 11- 25 or subroutine wbmco we obtain  $\beta^{*} / \beta_{0}^{*} = 0.529$  and  $\beta = (\beta^{*} / \beta_{0}^{*})\beta_{0}^{*}P_{e} = 0.529\times 0.081 = 0.043$ . Thus,  $\tau_{0} > 1 / \beta$  and we are in the logarithmic regime, and

$$
A^{*} = \ln (\tau_{0}\beta) + 2 - \beta = 2.018\mathrm{and}A = 145.6\mathrm{cm}^{-1}.
$$

Sticking this into equation (11.171),

$$
\begin{array}{l}\epsilon_{\mathrm{co}}(800\mathrm{K},1\mathrm{atm}) = \left(\frac{\pi I_{b\eta 0}}{\sigma T^4}\right)_{\eta_0 = 2143\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}\times A = \left(\frac{E_{b\eta 0}}{T^3}\right)_{\eta_0 = 2143\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}\times \frac{A}{\sigma T}\\ = 1.5563\times 10^{-8}\frac{\mathrm{W}}{\mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{K}^3}\times \frac{145.6\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}{5.670\times 10^{-8}\times 800\mathrm{W / m}^2\mathrm{K}^3}\\ = 0.0500. \end{array}
$$

If only total emissivities are desired, it would be very convenient to have correlations, tables, or charts from which the total emissivity can be read directly, rather than having to go through the algebra of the wide band correlations plus equation (11.171). A number of investigators have included total emissivity charts with their wide band correlation data; for example, Brosmer and Tien [141,150] compiled data on  $\mathrm{CH_4}$  and  $\mathrm{C_2H_2}$ , and Tien and coworkers [149] did the same for  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$ . However, by far the most monumental work has been collected by Hottel [18] and Hottel and Sarofim [11]. They considered primarily combustion gases, but they also presented charts for a number of other gases. Their data for total emissivity and absorptivity are presented in the form

$$
\begin{array}{l}\epsilon = \epsilon (p_aL,p,T_g),\\ \alpha = \alpha (p_aL,p,T_g,T_s)\approx \left(\frac{T_g}{T_s}\right)^{1 / 2}\epsilon \left(p_aL\frac{T_s}{T_g},p,T_s\right), \end{array} \tag{11.176}
$$

where  $T_g$  is the gas temperature and  $T_s$  is the temperature of an external blackbody (or gray) source such as a hot surface. Originally, the power for  $T_g / T_s$  recommended by Hottel was 0.65 for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and 0.45 for water vapor, but with greater theoretical understanding the single value of 0.5 has become accepted [11]. In equation (11.176)  $p_a$  is the partial pressure of the absorbing gas and  $p$  is the total pressure. (Hottel and Sarofim preferred a pressure path length over the density path length used by Edwards.) The emissivities were given in chart form vs. temperature, with pressure path length as parameter, and for an overall pressure of 1 atm. Later work by Leckner [169], Ludwig and coworkers [170,171], Sarofim and coworkers [172] and others has shown that the original charts by Hottel [11, 18], while accurate for many conditions (in particular, over the ranges covered by experimental data of the times), are seriously in error for some conditions (primarily those based on extrapolation of experimental data). New charts, based on the integration of spectral data, have been prepared by Leckner [169] and Ludwig and coworkers [170, 171], and show good agreement among each other. Emissivity charts, comparing the newly calculated data by Leckner [169] with Hottel's [18], are shown in Fig. 11- 29 for water vapor and in Fig. 11- 30 for carbon dioxide. These charts give the emissivities for the limiting case of vanishing partial pressure of the absorbing gas  $(p_a \rightarrow 0)$ .

FIGURE 11-30 Total emissivity of carbon dioxide at a total gas pressure of 1 bar and zero partial pressure, from Hottel [18] (solid lines) and Leckner [169] (dashed lines).

The original charts by Hottel also included pressure correction charts for the evaluation of cases with  $p_a \neq 0$  and  $p \neq 1$  bar, as well as charts for the overlap parameter  $\Delta \epsilon$ . Again, these factors were found to be somewhat inaccurate under extreme conditions and have been improved upon in later work. Particularly useful for calculations are the correlations given by Leckner [169], which (for temperatures above  $400\mathrm{K}$ ) have a maximum error of  $5\%$  for water vapor and  $10\%$  for  $\mathrm{CO}_2$ , respectively, compared to his spectrally integrated emissivities (i.e., the dashed lines in Figs. 11- 29 and 11- 30). In his correlation the zero- partial- pressure emissivity is given by

$$
\epsilon_0(p_aL,p = 1\mathrm{bar},T_g) = \exp \left[\sum_{i = 0}^{M}\sum_{j = 0}^{N}c_{ji}\left(\frac{T_g}{T_0}\right)^j\left(\log_{10}\frac{p_aL}{(p_aL)_0}\right)^i\right],\quad T_0 = 1000\mathrm{K},(p_aL)_0 = 1\mathrm{bar}\mathrm{cm}, \tag{11.177}
$$

and the  $c_{ji}$  are correlation constants given in Table 11.4 for water vapor and carbon dioxide. The emissivity for different pressure conditions is then found from

$$
\frac{\epsilon(p_aL,p,T_g)}{\epsilon_0(p_aL,1\mathrm{bar},T_g)} = 1 - \frac{(a - 1)(1 - P_E)}{a + b - 1 + P_E}\exp \left(-\left[1\log_{10}\frac{(p_aL)_m}{p_aL}\right]^2\right), \tag{11.178}
$$

where  $P_E$  is an effective pressure, and  $a, b, c,$  and  $(p_aL)_m$  are correlation parameters, also given in Table 11.4.

As noted before, in a mixture that contains both carbon dioxide and water vapor, the bands partially overlap and another correction factor must be introduced, which is found from

$$
\Delta \epsilon = \left[\frac{\zeta}{10.7 + 101\zeta} -0.0089\zeta^{10.4}\right]\left(\log_{10}\frac{(p_{\mathrm{H_2O}} + p_{\mathrm{CO_2}})L}{(p_aL)_0}\right)^{2.76}, \tag{11.179}
$$

with

$$
\zeta = \frac{p_{\mathrm{H_2O}}}{p_{\mathrm{H_2O}} + p_{\mathrm{CO_2}}}. \tag{11.180}
$$

This factor is directly applicable to emissivity and absorptivity.

To summarize, the total emissivity and absorptivity of gases containing  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ , water vapor, or both, may be calculated from:

$$
\begin{array}{r l r} & {\epsilon_{i}(p_{i}L,p,T_{g}) = \epsilon_{0i}(p_{i}L,1\mathrm{bar},T_{g})\left(\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_{0}}\right)_{i}(p_{i}L,p,T_{g}),} & {i = \mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{or}\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O},}\\ & {\alpha_{i}(p_{i}L,p,T_{g},T_{s}) = \left(\frac{T_{g}}{T_{s}}\right)^{1 / 2}\epsilon_{i}\left(p_{i}\frac{T_{s}}{T_{g}},p,T_{s}\right),} & {i = \mathrm{CO}_{2}\mathrm{or}\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O},}\\ & {\epsilon_{\mathrm{CO}_{2} + \mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}} = \epsilon_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} + \epsilon_{\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}} - \Delta \epsilon \left(p_{\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}}L,p_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}L\right),} & {(11.181c)}\\ & {\alpha_{\mathrm{CO}_{2} + \mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}} = \alpha_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} + \alpha_{\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}} - \Delta \epsilon \left(p_{\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O}}L\frac{T_{s}}{T_{g}},p_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}L\frac{T_{s}}{T_{g}}\right).} & {(11.181d)} \end{array} \tag{11.181d}
$$

For the convenience of the reader Appendix F contains the Fortran routines totemiss and totabsor, which calculate the total emissivity or absorptivity of a  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ - water vapor mixture from Leckner's correlation, and which can also be called from the stand- alone program Leckner through user prompts.

Example 11.13. Consider a  $1\mathrm{m}$  thick layer of a gas mixture at  $1000\mathrm{K}$  and 5 bar that consists of  $10\%$  carbon dioxide,  $20\%$  water vapor, and  $70\%$  nitrogen. What is the total normal intensity escaping from this layer?

# Solution

From equations (11.48) and (11.171) we see that the exiting total intensity is

$$
I = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}X}\right)d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}\epsilon_{\eta}d\eta = \frac{\epsilon\sigma T^{4}}{\pi},
$$

where  $\epsilon$  is the total emissivity of the water vapor- carbon dioxide mixture. First we calculate the emissivity of  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  at a total pressure of 1 bar from Table 11.4: With  $p_{\mathrm{CO_2}}L = 0.1\times 5\mathrm{mbar} = 50\mathrm{barcm}$  and  $T_{g} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  we find  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{CO_2,0}}(1\mathrm{bar}) = 0.157$  (which may also be estimated from Fig. 11- 30); for a total pressure of 5 bar we find from Table 11.4 the effective pressure is  $P_E = 5.14$ ,  $a = 1.1$ ,  $b = 0.23$ ,  $c = 1.47$ ,

and  $(p_{a}L)_{m} = 0.225$  bar cm. Thus, from equation (11.178)

$$
\left(\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}\right)_{\mathrm{CO}} = 1 - \frac{0.1\times(-4.14)}{0.33 + 5.14}\exp \left[-1.47\times \left(\log_{10}\frac{0.225}{50}\right)^2\right]\approx 1.00,
$$

and

$$
\epsilon_{\mathrm{CO}}\approx 0.157.
$$

Similarly, for water vapor with  $p_{\mathrm{H_2O}}L = 0.2\times 5\mathrm{mbar} = 100\mathrm{barcm}$  we find  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{H_2O0}}(1\mathrm{bar})\approx 0.359$  and the pressure correction factor becomes, with  $P_E = 7.56,$ $a = 1.88,$ $b = 1.1,$ $c = 0.5,$  and  $(p_{a}L)_{m} = 13.2$  bar cm,

$$
\left(\frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}\right)_{\mathrm{H_2O}} = 1 - \frac{0.888\times(-6.56)}{1.988 + 7.56}\exp \left[-0.5\times \left(\log_{10}\frac{13.2}{100}\right)^2\right] = 1.414,
$$

and

$$
\epsilon_{\mathrm{H_2O}}\approx 0.359\times 1.414 = 0.508.
$$

Finally, since we have a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapor, we need to deduct for the band overlaps: From equation (11.179), with  $\zeta = \frac{2}{3},\Delta \epsilon = 0.072$  . Thus, the total emissivity is  $\epsilon = 0.157 + 0.508-$ $0.072 = 0.593$  . Alternatively, and more easily, using subroutine totemiss with  $\mathrm{ph2o} = 1.$ $\mathsf{pco2} = .5,$  ptot  $= 5$ $\mathrm{L} = 100,$  and  $\mathrm{^7g} = 1000$  returns the same numbers.

The total normal intensity is then

$$
I = 0.593\times 5.670\times 10^{-8}\mathrm{W / (m^2K^4)}\times (1000\mathrm{K})^4 /\pi \mathrm{sr} = 10.70\mathrm{kW / m^2}\mathrm{sr}.
$$

It is apparent from this example that the calculation of total emissivities is far from an exact science and carries a good deal of uncertainty. Carrying along three digits in the above calculations is optimistic at best. The reader should understand that accurate emissivity values are difficult to measure, and that too many parameters are involved to make simple and accurate correlations possible.

# Mean Absorption Coefficients

We noted in the previous chapter that the emission term in the equation of transfer, equation (10.21), and in the divergence of the radiative heat flux, equation (10.59), is proportional to  $\kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta}$  . Thus, for the evaluation of total intensity or heat flux divergence it is convenient to define the following total absorption coefficient, known as the Planck- mean absorption coefficient:

$$
\kappa_{P}\equiv \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}\kappa_{\eta}d\eta}{\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}d\eta} = \frac{\pi}{\sigma T^{4}}\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}\kappa_{\eta}d\eta . \tag{11.182}
$$

Using narrow band averaged values for the absorption coefficient, and making again the assumption that the Planck function varies little across each vibration- rotation band, equation (11.182) may be restated as

$$
\kappa_{\epsilon} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\left(\frac{\pi I_{b\eta 0}}{\sigma T^{4}}\right)_{i}\int_{\Delta \eta_{\mathrm{band}}}\left(\frac{S}{d}\right)d\eta = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\left(\frac{\pi I_{b\eta 0}}{\sigma T^{4}}\right)\alpha_{i}, \tag{11.183}
$$

where the sum is over all  $N$  bands, and the  $I_{b\eta 0}$  are evaluated at the center of each band. It is interesting to note that the Planck- mean absorption coefficient depends only on the band strength parameter  $\alpha$  and, therefore, on temperature (but not on pressure). Values for  $\alpha$  have been measured and tabulated by a number of investigators for various gases and, using them, Planck- mean absorption coefficients have been presented by Tien [3], but these values are today known to be seriously in error. Alternatively, the Planck- mean absorption coefficient can be

![](images/0a9e01c5b07732d48cf77a2cc14d3fcaefb0477d7009d483957e5cdaf21efabd.jpg)  
FIGURE 11-31 Planck-mean absorption coefficients for carbon dioxide, and water vapor.

calculated directly from high- resolution databases such as HITRAN [32] and HITEMP [74] as [173]

$$
\kappa_{P} = \frac{\pi}{\sigma T^{4}}\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}\sum_{j}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta j}d\eta = \sum_{j}\left(\frac{\pi I_{b\eta 0}}{\sigma T^{4}}\right)_{j}\int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta j}d\eta = \sum_{j}\left(\frac{\pi I_{b\eta 0}}{\sigma T^{4}}\right)_{j}S_{j}, \tag{11.184}
$$

where the summation is now over all the spectral lines of the gas, and the  $I_{b\eta 0}$  are evaluated at the center of each line. Figures 11- 31 through 11- 33 show Planck- mean absorption coefficients calculated from the HITEMP 2010  $(\mathrm{CO}_2,\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O},$  and CO) and HITRAN 2008 databases (all gases). For some gases, which saw major updates in the most recent HITRAN 2008 version, the values obtained from HITRAN 1996 [57] are also shown for comparison. At higher temperatures the Planck- mean absorption coefficients from HITRAN 2008 are generally larger than those from HITRAN 1996, due to the inclusion of many more lines from higher vibrational energy levels. Accordingly, today's HITRAN 2008 can be used with confidence up to about  $1000\mathrm{K}$ . The latest version of HITEMP [74] includes many more "hot lines," and strives to be accurate for temperatures up to  $3000\mathrm{K}$ .

Sometimes the Planck- mean absorption coefficient is required for absorption (rather than emission), for example, when gas and radiation source are at different temperatures. This expression is known as the modified Planck- mean absorption coefficient, and is defined as

$$
\kappa_{m}(T,T_{s})\equiv \frac{\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}(T_{s})\kappa_{\eta}(T)d\eta}{\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}(T_{s})d\eta}. \tag{11.185}
$$

An approximate expression relating  $\kappa_{m}$  to  $\kappa_{i}$  has been given by Coss and Mighdoll [174] as

$$
\kappa_{m}(T,T_{s}) = \kappa_{P}(T_{s})\left(\frac{T_{s}}{T}\right). \tag{11.186}
$$

In later chapters we shall see that in optically thick situations the radiative heat flux becomes proportional to

$$
\frac{1}{\kappa_{\eta}}\nabla I_{b\eta} = \frac{1}{\kappa_{\eta}}\frac{dI_{b\eta}}{dT}\nabla T. \tag{11.187}
$$

This has led to the definition of an optically thick or Rosseland- mean absorption coefficient as

$$
\frac{1}{\kappa_{\scriptscriptstyle R}}\equiv \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\kappa_{\scriptscriptstyle R}}\frac{dI_{b\eta}}{dT} d\eta \bigg / \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{dI_{b\eta}}{dT} d\eta = \frac{\pi}{4\sigma T^{3}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\kappa_{\scriptscriptstyle R}}\frac{dI_{b\eta}}{dT} d\eta . \tag{11.188}
$$

FIGURE 11-32 Planck-mean absorption coefficients for ammonia, nitrous oxide, and sulfur dioxide.  FIGURE 11-33 Planck-mean absorption coefficients for carbon monoxide, nitric oxide, and methane.

Even though they noted the difficulty of integrating equation (11.188) over the entire spectrum (with zero absorption coefficient between bands), Abu- Romia and Tien [145] and Tien [3] attempted to evaluate the Rosseland- mean absorption coefficient for pure gases. Since the results are, at least by this author, regarded as very dubious they will not be reproduced here. We shall return to the Rosseland absorption coefficient when its use is warranted, i.e., when a medium is optically thick over the entire spectrum (for example, an optically thick particle background with or without molecular gases).

# 11.12 EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

Before going on to employ the above concepts of radiation properties of molecular gases in the solution of the radiative equation of transfer and the calculation of radiative heat fluxes, we want to briefly look at some of the more common experimental methods of determining these properties. While light sources, monochromators, detectors, and optical components are similar to the ones used for surface property measurements, as discussed in Section 3.10, gas property measurements result in transmission studies (as opposed to reflection measurements for surfaces).

All transmission measurements resemble one another to a certain extent: They consist of a

![](images/568cff5e3e6aee0531ad73168f2c00aa9c8385988a9542f5c6a99bba7dd139b6.jpg)  
FIGURE 11-34 General setup of gas radiation measurement apparatus [175].

light source, a monochromator or FTIR spectrometer (unless, for measurements over a narrow spectral range, a tunable laser is used as source), a chopper, a test cell with the (approximately isothermal) gas whose properties are to be measured, a detector, associated optics, and an amplifier- recorder device. The chopper often serves two purposes: (i) A pyroelectric detector cannot measure radiative intensity, rather, it measures changes in intensity; and (ii) if the beam is chopped before going through the sample gas then, by measuring the difference in intensity between chopper open and closed conditions, indeed only transmission of the incident light beam is measured. That is, any emission from the (possibly very hot) test gas and/or stray radiation will not be part of the signal. A typical setup is shown in Fig. 11- 34, depicting an apparatus used by Tien and Giedt [175]. A chopper is not required if an FTIR spectrometer is used, since the light is modulated inside the unit. However, for high test gas temperatures care must be taken to eliminate sample emission from the signal [176,177]. Usually, gas temperatures are measured independently, and knowledge of gas absorption coefficients is acquired. But it is also possible to radiatively determine the gas temperature, if accurate knowledge of the absorption coefficient is given, such as detailed line structure of diatomic molecules together with FTIR spectrometry [178- 180].

Measurements of radiative properties of gases may be characterized by the nature of the test gas containment and by the spectral width of the measurements. As indicated by Edwards [1], we distinguish among (1) hot window cell, (2) cold window cell, (3) nozzle seal cell, and (4) free jet devices; these may be used to make (a) narrow band measurements, (b) total band absorptance measurements, or (c) total emissivity/absorptivity measurements.

The hot window cell uses an isothermal gas within a container that is closed off at both ends by windows that are kept at the same temperature as the gas. While this setup is the most nearly ideal situation for measurements, it is generally very difficult to find window material that (i) can withstand the high temperatures at which gas properties are often measured, (ii) are transparent in the spectral regions where measurements are desired (usually near- infrared to infrared) and do not experience "thermal runaway" (strong increase in absorptivity at a certain temperature level), and (iii) do not succumb to chemical attack from the test gas and other gases. Such cells have been used, for example, by Penner [20], Goldstein [181], and Oppenheim and Goldman [182].

The cold window cell, as the name implies, lets the probing beam enter and exit the test

![](images/12b1a82d6caf3f9bf703d00ea4e37c44d73d17bb4f0be3f14d8d0644286776b2.jpg)  
FIGURE 11-35 Schematic of the high-temperature gas furnace used by Tien and Giedt [175].

cell through water- cooled windows. This method has the advantage that the problems in a hot window cell are nearly nonexistent. However, if the geometric path of the gas is relatively short, this method introduces serious temperature and density variations along the path. Tien and Giedt [175] designed a high- temperature furnace, consisting of a zirconia tube surrounded by a graphite heater, that allowed temperatures up to  $2000\mathrm{K}$ . The furnace was fitted with water- cooled, movable zinc selenide windows, which are transmissive between  $0.5\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $20\mu \mathrm{m}$  and stay inert to reactions with water vapor and carbon oxides for temperatures below  $550\mathrm{K}$ . A schematic of their furnace is shown in Fig. 11- 35. While allowing high temperatures, it is impossible to obtain truly isothermal gas columns with such a device. For example, for a nominal cell at  $1750\mathrm{K}$  of  $30\mathrm{cm}$  length, they found that the temperature gradually varied by a rather substantial  $350\mathrm{K}$  over the central  $2 / 3$  of the cell, and then rapidly dropped to  $330\mathrm{K}$  over the outer  $1 / 3$ . This apparatus was used by Tien and coworkers to measure the properties of various gases [144, 146- 149, 183].

Nozzle seal cells are open flow cells in which the absorbing gas is contained within the cell by layers on each end of inert gases such as argon or nitrogen. This system eliminates some of the problems with windows, but may also cause density and temperature gradients near the seal; in addition, some scattering may be introduced by the turbulent eddies of the mixing flows [184]. This type of apparatus has been used by Hottel and Mangelsdorf [13] and Eckert [185] for total emissivity measurements of water vapor and carbon dioxide. Most of the measurements made by Edwards and coworkers also used nozzle seal cells [131, 132, 134, 143, 184, 186, 187]. A schematic of the apparatus used by Bevans and coworkers [186] is shown in Fig. 11- 36. Using a burner and jet for gas radiation measurements eliminates the window problems, and is in many ways similar to the nozzle seal cell. Free jet devices can be used for extremely high temperatures, but they also introduce considerable uncertainty with respect to gas temperature and density distribution and to path length. Ferriso and Ludwig [188] used such a device for spectral measurements of the  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  water vapor band.

More recently, Modest has constructed a high- temperature gas transmissometer, shown schematically in Fig. 11- 37 and used by Bharadwaj et al. [63, 65, 66] to measure transmissivities of carbon dioxide and water vapor. The device is based on the infrared emissometer [189- 191] shown in Fig. 3- 44 and combines the advantages of hot- window and cold- window absorption

cells. In essence, the apparatus consists of a hermetically sealed high- temperature furnace, a motorized tube fitted with an optical window, a sealed optical path, and an FTIR spectrometer with internal infrared light source and an external detector, which can only detect the modulated light from the FTIR. Light from the FTIR is imaged onto a platinum mirror inside the furnace; the reflected light, in turn, is imaged onto the external detector. The cold drop- tube with an optical window is placed into position and retracted by a high- speed motor. The gas column between platinum mirror and optical window forms an isothermal absorption cell and, since the optical window resides within the furnace's hot zone for only a few seconds at a time, this device is able to measure transmissivities of truly isothermal high- temperature gas columns.

All multispectral diagnostic techniques discussed so far have employed single- detector monochromator or FTIR spectroscopy. Such devices can provide spectral scans in a wide range of resolutions and of great accuracy, but to obtain a spectrally resolved measurement with good signal- to- noise ratio takes tens of seconds for low- resolution narrow- band scans to hours for high- resolution full- spectrum measurements. Very few attempts have been made to date to obtain time- resolved multispectral signals from turbulent systems, because—to obtain snapshots of a turbulent flowfield—exposure times must be of order of  $0.1\mathrm{ms}$  or less. Richardson et al. [192, 193] were perhaps the first to attempt such measurements, using a 32- element InSb linear array detector fitted with a grating monochromator. The apparatus was quite similar to the one shown in Fig. 11- 34, except that there is no need to rotate the monochromator's prism or grating, with the spectrally separated light hitting different elements of the array detector simultaneously. Their device was able to collect a 32- spectrum signal over  $160\mu \mathrm{s}$ , storing 250 samples for each detector element. This resulted in an equivalent FTIR resolution of  $32\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  when collecting a spectrum of  $250\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , with a signal- to- noise ratio of about 50. Their improved second device was able to hold 2048 full spectra collected every  $16\mu \mathrm{s}$ . A similar apparatus was built by Keltner et al. [194], using a  $256\times 256$  MCT array detector. They argued that the use of (dual) prisms is preferable to grating monochromators in connection with array detectors. This dual prism arrangement was also used by Ji et al. [195], together with a 160- element PbSe linear array detector. The resulting high- speed spectrometer, is capable of taking near- instantaneous snapshots at a rate of  $390\mathrm{Hz}$ . The device was calibrated against a blackbody, and spectra from a laminar premixed flame were compared with measurements using a grating spectrometer—InSb detector combination. Later measurements have been carried out with this high- speed infrared array spectrometer, to provide radiation data for the otherwise well- documented Sandia Workshop flames [196–198], and for a sooty ethylene air diffusion flame [199].

# Data Correlation

The half- width of a typical spectral line in the infrared is on the order of  $0.1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . To get a strong enough signal with a monochromator, any spectral measurement is by experimental necessity an average over several wavenumbers and, therefore, dozens or even hundreds of lines, unless an extremely monochromatic laser beam is employed. Thus, the measured transmissivity or (after subtracting from unity) absorptivity/emissivity is of the narrow band average type. Most FTIR measurements also fall into this category, although they generally have much better resolution than monochromators; resolutions better than  $0.1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  are possible with high- end spectrometers. A correlation for the average absorption coefficient may be found by inverting equation (11.68) or equation (11.70), depending on whether the Elsasser or one of the statistical models is to be used, in either case yielding

$$
\frac{S}{d} = \frac{S}{d} (\overline{\epsilon}_{\eta},X,\gamma /d), \tag{11.189}
$$

where the  $\overline{\epsilon}_{\eta}$  and  $X$  (density or pressure path length) are measured quantities, and the width- to- spacing ratio must be determined independently. Most early measurements have assumed a constant  $\gamma /d$  for the entire band, in which case the width- to- spacing ratio can be obtained in a number of ways: (i) direct prediction of  $\gamma$  and  $d$ , (ii) using an independently determined band intensity,  $\alpha$ , as the closing parameter, or (iii) finding a best fit for  $\beta$  (which is directly related to  $\gamma /d$ ) in the exponential wide band model. With the recent advent of high- resolution databases it has been recognized that line spacing can vary dramatically across a band. The first narrow band correlation with variable  $\beta$  was done by Brosmer and Tien [200] for propylene, using Goody's model and least- mean- square- error fits.

In medium- resolution measurements of  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  Modest and Bharadwaj [63] correlated their experimental transmissivities to the Malkmus model through a least- mean- square- error fit. As an example the  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  bands of  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  at 300 and  $1000\mathrm{K}$  are shown in Fig. 11- 38 and compared with

data obtained from the most accurate databases of the time, HITRAN 1996 [57] and EM2C [106].  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  is seen to have two bands around  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$ , one centered at  $3615\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , the other at  $3715\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . Agreement between experiment- based correlation and HITRAN 1996 is seen to be excellent except near the four  $S / d$  peaks, where the absorption coefficient is dominated by a few widely- spaced strong lines (about  $1.8\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  apart). This leads to a jagged appearance if the statistical definition for  $S / d$  is used, equation (11.82), and even if straight averaging over  $4\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  (equal to the experimental resolution) is carried out. The line labeled "HITRAN/FTIR avg." was obtained by averaging the absorption coefficient with the FTIR's instrument response function [201] as weight factor, which comes close to simulating the actual experiment. Results from the EM2C database are also shown for comparison. Because of its relatively low resolution of  $25\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  this database cannot capture the dual peaks, but agreement with experiment is excellent if the lower resolution is accounted for.

Measured spectral absorptivities may be integrated to determine total band absorptances. Plotting those band absorptances that fall into the logarithmic regime vs.  $XP_{e}$  on semilog paper gives a straight line whose slope is the band width parameter (cf. Table 11.2). Preparing a linear plot of  $A / P_{e}$  vs.  $\sqrt{X / P_{e}}$  for data in the square root regime gives again a straight line, this time with  $\sqrt{\alpha\omega\beta^{*}}$  as the slope (where  $\beta^{*} = \beta /P_{e} = \pi \gamma /d$  is the width- to- spacing ratio for a dilute mixture, cf. Tables 11.2 and 11.3). Finally, total emissivity values may be calculated by substituting the measured total band absorptances into equation (11.171).

# Experimental Errors

Most of the earlier gas property measurements were subject to considerable experimental errors, as listed by Edwards [184]. (1) inhomogeneity and uncertainty in the values of temperature, pressure, and composition, (2) scattering by mixing zones in nozzle seals and free jets, (3) reflection and scattering by optical windows, and/or (4) deterioration of the window material due to adsorption or "thermal runaway." In addition, essentially all data until the 1980s were poorly correlated, using fixed values for  $\gamma /d$  (across an entire vibration- rotation band), with a resulting correlational accuracy of  $\pm 20\%$  at best. Only the more modern measurements by Phillips [107,108] and Bharndwaj et al. [63,65,66] apparently have experimental accuracies better than  $5\%$  and have been accurately correlated.

11.1 Estimate the eigenfrequency for vibration,  $\nu_{e}$ , for a CO molecule.

11.2 A certain gas at 1 bar pressure has a molecular mass of  $m = 10^{- 22}$  g and a diameter of  $D = 5\times 10^{- 8}$  cm. At what temperature would Doppler and collision broadening result in identical broadening widths for a line at a wavenumber of  $4000\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ?

11.3 Water vapor is known to have spectral lines in the vicinity of  $\lambda = 1.38\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Consider a single, broadened spectral line centered at  $\lambda_0 = 1.33\mu \mathrm{m}$ . If the water vapor is at a pressure of 0.1 atm and a temperature of  $1000\mathrm{K}$ , what would you expect to be the main cause for broadening? Over what range of wavenumbers would you expect the line to be appreciable, i.e., over what range is the absorption coefficient at least  $1\%$  of its value at the line center?

11.4 Compute the half- width for a spectral line of  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  at  $2.8\mu \mathrm{m}$  for both Doppler and collision broadening as a function of pressure and temperature. Find the temperature as a function of pressure for which both broadening phenomena result in the same half- width. (Note: The effective diameter of the  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  molecule is  $4.0\times 10^{- 8}\mathrm{cm}$ .)

11.5 Methane is known to have a vibration- rotation band around  $1.7\mu \mathrm{m}$ . It is desired to measure the Doppler half- width of a spectral line in that band at room temperature  $(T = 300\mathrm{K})$ . In order to make sure that collision broadening is negligible, the pressure of the  $\mathrm{CH_4}$  is adjusted so that the expected collision half- width is only  $1 / 10$  of the Doppler half- width. What is this pressure? (For methane:  $D = 0.381\mathrm{nm}$ .)

11.6 Repeat Problem 11.4 for CO at a spectral location of  $4.8\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Note: The effective diameter of the CO molecule is  $3.4\times 10^{- 8}\mathrm{cm}$ .)

11.7 A certain gas has two important vibration- rotation bands centered at  $4\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Measurements of spectral lines in the  $4\mu \mathrm{m}$  band (taken at  $300\mathrm{K}$  and  $1\mathrm{bar} = 10^{5}\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$ ) indicate a half- width of  $\gamma_{\eta} = 0.5\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . Predict the half- width in the  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$  band for the gas at  $500\mathrm{K}$ ,  $3\mathrm{bar}$ . (The diameter of the gas molecules is known to be between  $5\mathrm{\AA}< D< 40\mathrm{\AA}$ .)

11.8 It is desired to measure the volume fraction of CO in a hot gas by measuring the transmissivity of a  $10\mathrm{cm}$  long column, using a blackbody source and a detector responsive around  $4.7\mu \mathrm{m}$ . The conditions in the column are  $1000\mathrm{K}$ ,  $1\mathrm{atm}$ , and properties for CO around  $4.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  are known to be  $S = 0.8\mathrm{cm}^{- 2}\mathrm{atm}^{- 1}$ ,  $\gamma = 0.02\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , and  $d = 0.05\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . Give an expression relating measured transmissivity to CO volume fraction.

11.10 Consider a gas for which the semistatistical model is applicable, i.e.,  $\overline{\epsilon}_{\eta} = 1 - \exp (- W_{\eta} / d)$ . To predict  $\overline{\epsilon}_{\eta}$  for arbitrary situations, a band- averaged (or constant) value for  $\gamma_{\eta} / d$  must be known. Experimentally available are values for  $\alpha = \int_{\Delta \eta}(S_{\eta} / d)d\eta$  and  $\overline{\epsilon}_{\eta} = \overline{\epsilon}_{\eta}(\eta)$  (for optically thick situations) for given  $p_{e}$  and  $T$ . It is also known that

$$
\frac{\gamma_{\eta}}{d}\simeq \left(\frac{\gamma_{\eta}}{d}\right)_0p_e\left(\frac{T_0}{T}\right)^{1 / 2}.
$$

gas with a molecular weight of  $20\mathrm{g / mol},$  a mean line half- width  $\gamma = 0.01\mathrm{cm}^{- 1},$  a mean line spacing of  $d = 0.1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1},$  and a mean line strength of  $S = 8\times 10^{- 5}\mathrm{cm}^{- 2} / (\mathrm{g / m}^{3})$  . (a) For a gas column  $10\mathrm{cm}$  thick determine the mean spectral emissivity of the gas.  $(b)$  What happens if the pressure is increased to 20 atm? (Since no broadening parameters are known you may assume the effective broadening pressure to be equal to the total pressure.)

11.12 Repeat Problem 11.11 for a four- atomic gas.

11.13  $1\mathrm{kg}$  of a gas mixture at  $2000\mathrm{K}$  and 1 atm occupies a container of  $1\mathrm{m}$  height.

It is known that, at a certain spectral location, the line half- width is  $\gamma = 300\mathrm{MHz},$  the mean line spacing is  $d = 2000\mathrm{MHz},$  and the line strength is  $S = 100\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}\mathrm{MHz}$  . (a) Calculate the mean spectral emissivity under these conditions. (b) What will happen to the emissivity if the sealed container is cooled to  $300\mathrm{K?}$

11.14 A  $50\mathrm{cm}$  thick layer of a pure gas is maintained at  $1000\mathrm{K}$  and 1 atm. It is known that, at a certain spectral location, the mean line half- width is  $\gamma = 0.1\mathrm{nm},$  the mean line spacing is  $d = 2\mathrm{nm},$  and the mean line strength is  $S = 0.002\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}\mathrm{nm}\mathrm{atm}^{- 1} = 2\times 10^{- 10}\mathrm{atm}^{- 1}$  . What is the mean spectral emissivity under these conditions? (  $1\mathrm{nm} = 10^{- 9}\mathrm{m})$

11.15 The following data for a diatomic gas at  $300\mathrm{K}$  and 1 atm are known: The mean line spacing is  $0.6\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  and the mean line half- width is  $0.03\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ; the mean line strength (= integrated absorption coefficient) is  $0.8\mathrm{cm}^{- 2}\mathrm{atm}^{- 1}$  (based on a pressure absorption coefficient).

What is the expected transmissivity for a gas column of  $30\mathrm{cm}$  length, assuming the Malkmus model to hold?

11.17  $1\mathrm{kg}$  of a gas mixture at  $2000\mathrm{K}$  and 1 atm occupies a container of  $1\mathrm{m}$  height. The gas consists of  $70\%$  nitrogen (by volume) and  $30\%$  of an absorbing species.

(b) What will happen to the emissivity if the sealed container is cooled to  $300\mathrm{K}$  at constant pressure (with fixed container cross-section and sinking top end)?

Note: The mean line intensity is directly proportional to the number of molecules of the absorbing gas and otherwise constant. The line half- width is given by

$$
\gamma = [\gamma_{n0}p_n + \gamma_{a0}p_a]\sqrt{\frac{T_0}{T}}\qquad (p\mathrm{in}\mathrm{atm},T_0 = 300\mathrm{K}),
$$

where  $p_n$  and  $p_a$  are partial pressures of nitrogen and absorbing species.

11.18 A certain gas is known to behave almost according to the rigid- rotor/harmonic- oscillator model, resulting in gradually changing line strengths (with wavenumber) and somewhat irregular line spacing.

11.22 Consider the (highly artificial) absorption coefficient shown. Mathematically, this may be expressed as

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = A[\eta +3h(\eta)]\qquad 0< \eta < \infty
$$

where  $h(\eta)$  is a periodic function of period  $2d$ , defined by

$$
h(\eta) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\eta , & 0< \eta < d,\\ 2d - \eta , & d< \eta < 2d. \end{array} \right.

(c) determine the narrow band average transmissivity for a slab of thickness  $L$  from the  $k$ -distribution; compare with the gray-gas value (using  $\overline{\kappa}_{\eta}$ ).

11.23 Consider again the gas of Problem 11.15, but replace the line intensity by

$$
S_{\eta} = S_{\eta_0}e^{-|\eta_0 - \eta_0| / \omega},\quad S_{\eta_0} = 0.02\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{atm}^{-1},\quad \omega = 20\mathrm{cm}^{-1}.
$$

In what regime is this optical condition? What is the total band absorptance?

11.24 A mixture of nitrogen and sulfur dioxide (with 0.05 volume-  $\%$ $\mathrm{SO}_2$  ) is at 1 atm and  $300\mathrm{K}$ . For the strong  $\nu_{3}$  band of  $\mathrm{SO}_2$ , centered at  $\eta_{3} = 1361\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , it is known that

$$
\frac{\gamma_{\eta}}{d}\simeq 0.06,\quad \frac{S_{\eta}}{d} = 17\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{atm}^{-1}\exp \left[-\left(\frac{\eta - \eta_{3}}{25\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}\right)^{2}\right].

(c) For comparison, calculate the total band absorptance from the wide band model. (Hint: For  $300\mathrm{K}$  it is known that  $\mathrm{P} / \beta_0^*\geq 1.$

Note: Under these conditions collision broadening is the predominant broadening mechanism.

11.25 A gas mixture at  $1500\mathrm{K}$  and 1 atm is known to contain a small amount of  $\mathrm{CO}_2$ . To remotely determine the partial pressure of  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  the band absorptance of the  $\mathrm{CO}_2$ $4.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band is measured and is found to be  $100\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  for a path length of  $1\mathrm{m}$ .

11.26 Nitrogen at  $2000\mathrm{K}$  and 1 atm contains a small amount of water vapor. To remotely determine the water vapor concentration the contribution of the  $6.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band toward the total emissivity is measured, and is found to be  $\epsilon_{6.3} = 0.012$  for a  $1\mathrm{m}$  thick isothermal gas layer. Determine the mole fraction of water vapor.

11.27 A large moon in the outer solar system has a thin atmosphere of pure methane. In order to determine average temperatures of the atmosphere, a satellite measures the total band absorptance of the  $3.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  fundamental band at an altitude where the atmospheric pressure is  $100\mathrm{Pa}$ . If the total band absorptance for a  $100\mathrm{km}$  thick layer is measured as  $A_{3,3} = 259\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , determine the temperature of the atmosphere (this may be left in the form of an implicit expression). Note: At the expected cold temperature  $(< 200\mathrm{K})$  you may assume  $\gamma \neq \gamma_0\neq \gamma '(T)$ .

11.28 A mixture of nitrogen and sulfur dioxide is at 1 atm total pressure. To measure the partial pressure of the sulfur dioxide in a furnace environment, an instrument is used that measures total band absorptance for the strong  $\mathrm{SO}_2$  band centered at  $\eta_c = 1361\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ .

11.29 An optical device to determine  $\mathrm{NO}_x$  content in the combustion products powering a gas turbine measures the transmissivity of NO for its  $5.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band. The device consists of a blackbody source  $(T_{bb} = 2000\mathrm{K})$ , two ports, a filter/detector combination (with flat response  $1750\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}< \eta < 2000\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , and zero response elsewhere), and a chopper (such that the detector registers radiation from the blackbody source, but not the emission from the combustion gases). Two measurements are taken: one with an inert gas in the turbine (signal  $S_0$ ), and another with combustion gases present (assume  $T_g = 1600\mathrm{K} = \mathrm{const}$ ,  $p_g = 5\mathrm{bar} = \mathrm{const}$ , light path through gas  $L = 1\mathrm{m}$ ; signal  $S$ ).

$$

where  $x_{\mathrm{NO}}$  is the volume or mole fraction of  $\mathrm{NO}$ , and assuming that the Planck function is constant across  $\Delta \eta$ .

(b) If the transmissivity is measured as  $\tau = 0.7$ , what is the  $\mathrm{NO}$  volume fraction,  $x_{\mathrm{NO}}$ ?

Note: For NO at  $1600\mathrm{K}$ ,  $\beta^* /\beta_0^* = 0.827$ .

11.30 It is desired to predict the fraction of the sunlight absorbed by the nitrous oxide  $(\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O})$  contained in the atmosphere. You may assume that the atmosphere is a  $20\mathrm{km}$  high layer of  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{- N}_2\mathrm{O}$  mixture, that the atmosphere is isothermal with a linear pressure variation from  $1\mathrm{atm}$  at the ground to zero at the top of the atmosphere, and that  $\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  makes up  $10^{- 40}\%$  by volume of the mixture everywhere.

$\mathrm{N}_2\mathrm{O}$  has two vibration- rotation bands with the following wide band coefficients (at the temperature of the atmosphere):

<table><tr><td></td><td>α</td><td>β*</td><td>ω</td><td>n</td><td>b</td></tr><tr><td>4.5 μm band</td><td>2035 cm-2 atm-1</td><td>0.145</td><td>22 cm-1</td><td>0.6</td><td>1.12</td></tr><tr><td>7.8 μm band</td><td>161 cm-2 atm-1</td><td>0.377</td><td>18.5 cm-1</td><td>0.6</td><td>1.12</td></tr></table>

Determine the partial pressure of the water vapor.

11.35 One method of measuring the temperature of a high- temperature gas is to determine the total band absorptance of a vibration- rotation band of the gas under the prevailing conditions. Consider a  $20\mathrm{cm}$  thick layer of pure methane,  $\mathrm{CH_4}$ , at 1 atm pressure. If the total band absorptance of the  $3.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band is  $587\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , what is the temperature of the  $\mathrm{CH_4}$ ?

What is the temperature of the mixture if the total band absorptance has been measured as  $142\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  for a  $1\mathrm{m}$  thick gas layer?

11.38 The Earth's pollution with sulfur dioxide  $(\mathrm{SO_2})$  is determined by measuring the transmission of a light beam from a satellite. Assuming that the band absorptance of the  $7.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band has been measured as  $10.0\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , and that the atmosphere may be approximated as a  $10\mathrm{km}$  thick isothermal layer of nitrogen (with a trace of  $\mathrm{SO_2}$ ) at  $0.5\mathrm{atm}$  and  $- 10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , determine the volume fraction of  $\mathrm{SO_2}$ .

11.45 Develop a simple box model for the evaluation of the effective band width, i.e.,  $A = \int_0^\infty \epsilon_\eta d\eta = \overline{\epsilon}_\eta \Delta \eta$ , based on an average emissivity (rather than absorption coefficient). You may assume that the line spacing and line intensity are constant across the band. Calculate the total band absorptance of water vapor at  $0.1\mathrm{atm}$  and  $400\mathrm{K}$  for path lengths of  $1\mathrm{mm}$  and  $1\mathrm{m}$ , assuming that  $\Delta \eta \approx \omega$ , where  $\omega$  is the band width parameter from the exponential wide band model. Compare with results from that model.

# RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF PARTICULAR MEDIA

# 12.1 INTRODUCTION

When an electromagnetic wave or a photon interacts with a medium containing small particles, the radiative intensity may be changed by absorption and/or scattering. Common examples of this interaction are sunlight being absorbed by a cloud of smoke (which is nothing but a multitude of fine particles suspended in air), scattering of sunshine by the atmosphere (the atmosphere consisting of molecules which are, in fact, tiny particles) resulting in blue skies and red sunsets, and the colors of the rainbow. Radiation scattering by particles was first dealt with by astrophysicists, who were interested in the scattering of starlight by interstellar dust. Scientists from many other disciplines are concerned with the scattering of electromagnetic waves: Meteorologists are concerned with scattering within the Earth's atmosphere (scattering of sunlight as well as scattering of radar waves for observation of precipitation); electrical engineers and physicists deal with the propagation of radio waves through the atmosphere; physicists, chemists, and engineers today use light scattering as diagnostic tools for nonintrusive and nondestructive measurements in gases, liquids, and solids. Reviews of thermal radiation phenomena in particulate media have been given by Tien and Drolen [1], and also by Dombrovsky and Baillis [2].

How much and into which direction a particle scatters an electromagnetic wave passing through its vicinity depends on  $(i)$  the shape of the particle,  $(ii)$  the material of the particle (i.e., the complex index of refraction,  $m = n - ik)$  , (iii) its relative size, and  $(iv)$  the clearance between particles. In radiative analyses the shape of particles is usually assumed to be spherical (for spherical and irregularly shaped objects) or cylindrical (for long fibrous materials). These simplifying assumptions give generally excellent results, since averaging over many millions of irregular shapes tends to smoothen the irregularities [1]. In the following discussion we shall primarily consider absorption and scattering by spherical particles, as shown in Fig. 12- 1.

An electromagnetic wave or photon passing through the immediate vicinity of spherical particles will be absorbed or scattered. The scattering is due to three separate phenomena, namely,  $(i)$  diffraction (waves never come into contact with the particle, but their direction of propagation is altered by the presence of the particle),  $(ii)$  reflection by a particle (waves reflected from the surface of the sphere), and  $(iii)$  refraction in a particle (waves that penetrate into the sphere and, after partial absorption, reemerge traveling into a different direction). The vast majority of photons are scattered elastically, i.e., their wavelength (and energy) remain unchanged. A tiny fraction undergo inelastic or Raman scattering (the photons reemerge with a different wavelength). While very important for optical diagnostics, the Raman effect is unimportant for the

evaluation of radiative heat transfer rates, and we shall treat only elastic scattering in this book. If scattering by one particle is not affected by the presence of surrounding particles, we speak of independent scattering, otherwise we have dependent scattering. Thus, the radiative properties of a cloud of spherical particles of radius  $a$ , interacting with an electromagnetic wave of wavelength  $\lambda$ , are governed by three independent nondimensional parameters:

$$
\mathrm{complex~index~of~refraction:}m = n - i\epsilon , \tag{12.1}
$$

$$
x = 2\pi a / \lambda , \tag{12.2}
$$

clearance- to- wavelength ratio:  $c / \lambda$

If scattering is independent  $(c / \lambda \gg 1)$ , then only the first two parameters are needed. For the classification of dependent scattering, the clearance- to- wavelength ratio is often replaced by a purely geometric parameter,  $c / a$ , which in turn may be related to the volume fraction of particles,  $f_{\theta}$ . While in earlier works, for example that by van de Hulst [3], it was assumed that dependent effects were a function of particle separation only, it is now known that wavelength effects also play a role. This was first recognized by Hottel and coworkers [4]. Since then, a number of investigators, notably Tien and coworkers [1, 5- 9], have established limits for when dependent effects must be considered. Their results, summarized in Fig. 12- 2, show that dependent scattering effects may be ignored as long as  $f_{\theta} < 0.006$  or  $c / \lambda > 0.5$ . Since these values include nearly all heat transfer applications, only independent scattering is discussed in the present chapter. The reader interested in the prediction of dependent scattering properties should consult the monograph by Tien and Drolen [1].

# 12.2 ABSORPTION AND SCATTERING FROM A SINGLE SPHERE

The scattering and absorption of radiation by single spheres was first discussed during the later part of the nineteenth century by Lord Rayleigh [10, 11], who obtained a simple solution for spheres whose diameters are much smaller than the wavelength of radiation (small size parameter,  $x \ll 1$ ). This work was followed in the 1890s by the work of Lorenz* [12, 13], in 1908 by the classical paper of Gustav Mie† [14], and in 1909 by a similar treatment of Debye [15].

![](images/4d07d8496254813a069c85606595ef666e5de9e8ca906f2332cfb6670f30a4f4.jpg)  
FIGURE 12-2 Scattering regime map for independent and dependent scattering [1].

Lorenz's work was based on his own theory of electromagnetism rather than Maxwell's, while Mie developed an equivalent solution to Maxwell's equations [cf. equations (2.11) through (2.14)] for an electromagnetic wave train traveling through a medium with an imbedded sphere. Although the work of Lorenz predates that of Mie, the general theory describing radiative scattering by absorbing spheres is generally referred to as the "Mie theory." More recently, in recognition of Lorenz's contributions, the terminology "Lorenz- Mie theory" has also become popular. An exhaustive review of the history of the development of particle scattering theory has been given by Kerker [16].

The complicated Lorenz- Mie scattering theory must generally be used if the size of the sphere is such that it is too large to apply the Rayleigh theory, but too small to employ geometric optics (which requires  $x \gg 1$  as well as  $kx \gg 1$ ). We shall give here a very brief discussion of the Lorenz- Mie theory and some representative results. Detailed derivations may be found in the books on the subject by van de Hulst [3], Kerker [16], Deirmendjian [17], and Bohren and Huffman [18].

The amount of scattering and absorption by a particle is usually expressed in terms of the scattering cross- section,  $C_{\mathrm{sca}}$ , and absorption cross- section,  $C_{\mathrm{abs}}$ . The total amount of absorption and scattering, or extinction, is expressed in terms of the extinction cross- section,

$$
C_{\mathrm{ext}} = C_{\mathrm{abs}} + C_{\mathrm{sca}}. \tag{12.4}
$$

Often efficiency factors  $Q$  are used instead of cross- sections; they are nondimensionalized with the projected surface area of the sphere, or

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {absorptionefficiencyfactor:Q_{\mathrm{abs}} = \frac{C_{\mathrm{abs}}}{\pi a^2},}\\ & {scatteringefficiencyfactor:Q_{\mathrm{sca}} = \frac{C_{\mathrm{sca}}}{\pi a^2},}\\ & {extinctionefficiencyfactor:Q_{\mathrm{ext}} = \frac{C_{\mathrm{ext}}}{\pi a^2},} \end{array} \tag{12.7}
$$

and

$$
Q_{\mathrm{ext}} = Q_{\mathrm{abs}} + Q_{\mathrm{sca}}. \tag{12.8}
$$

Radiation interacting with a spherical particle may be scattered away from its original direction by an angle  $\Theta$ , i.e., the propagation vector of the electric and magnetic fields may be redirected by the scattering angle (Fig. 12- 1). This deflection from the incident direction is described by the angle  $\Theta$  alone because, for a spherical particle, there can be no azimuthal variation. The intensity of the wave scattered by the angle  $\Theta$  [i.e., the magnitude of the Poynting vector, equation (2.42)] is proportional to two complex amplitude functions  $S_{1}(\Theta)$  and  $S_{2}(\Theta)$ , where the subscripts denote two perpendicular polarizations. Once these amplitude functions have been determined, the intensity of radiation  $I_{\mathrm{sca}}$ , scattered by an angle  $\Theta$  from the incident unpolarized beam of strength  $I_{\mathrm{in}}$ , may be calculated [3, 16, 17] from

$$
\frac{I_{\mathrm{sca}}(\Theta)}{I_{\mathrm{in}}} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{i_1 + i_2}{x^2}, \tag{12.9}
$$

where  $i_{1}$  and  $i_{2}$  are the nondimensional polarized intensities calculated from

$$
i_{1}(x,m,\Theta) = |S_{1}|^{2},\quad i_{2}(x,m,\Theta) = |S_{2}|^{2}. \tag{12.10}
$$

From equation (12.9) it follows that the total amount of energy scattered by one sphere into all directions [3] is

$$
Q_{\mathrm{sca}} = \frac{C_{\mathrm{sca}}}{\pi a^2} = \frac{a^2}{\pi a^2}\int_{4\pi}\frac{I_{\mathrm{sca}}}{I_{\mathrm{in}}} d\Omega = \frac{1}{x^2}\int_{0}^{\pi}(i_1 + i_2)\sin \Theta d\Theta . \tag{12.11}
$$

The fraction of this energy that is scattered into any given direction is denoted by the scattering phase function  $\Phi (\Theta)$ , which is normalized such that

$$
\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega \equiv 1. \tag{12.12}
$$

Thus, together with equation (12.9), the scattering phase function may be expressed as

$$
\Phi (\Theta) = \frac{i_1 + i_2}{\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}(i_1 + i_2)d\Omega} = 2\frac{i_1 + i_2}{x^2Q_{\mathrm{sca}}}. \tag{12.13}
$$

Finally, total extinction by a single particle (absorption within the particle, plus scattering into all directions) is related to the real part of the amplitude functions by

$$
Q_{\mathrm{ext}} = \frac{4}{x^2}\Re \{S(0)\} , \tag{12.14}
$$

where the amplitude function  $S$  is without a subscript because  $S_{1}(0) = S_{2}(0)$

The major difficulty in the evaluation of scattering properties lies in the calculation of the complex amplitude functions  $S_{1}(\Theta)$  and  $S_{2}(\Theta)$ . For the general case of arbitrary values for the complex index of refraction  $m$  and the size parameter  $x$ , the full Lorenz- Mie equations as expressed by van de Hulst [3] must be employed,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{S_1(\Theta) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{2n + 1}{n(n + 1)} [a_n\tau_n(\cos \Theta) + b_n\tau_n(\cos \Theta)],}\\ {S_2(\Theta) = \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\frac{2n + 1}{n(n + 1)} [b_n\tau_n(\cos \Theta) + a_n\tau_n(\cos \Theta)],} \end{array} \tag{12.16}
$$

where the direction- dependent functions  $\pi_{n}$  and  $\tau_{n}$  are related to Legendre polynomials  $P_{n}$  (for a description of these polynomials, see, e.g., Wylie [19]) by

$$
\begin{array}{l}\pi_n(\cos \Theta) = \frac{dP_n(\cos\Theta)}{d\cos\Theta},\\ \displaystyle \tau_n(\cos \Theta) = \cos \Theta \pi_n(\cos \Theta) - \sin^2\Theta \frac{d\pi_n(\cos\Theta)}{d\cos\Theta}, \end{array} \tag{12.18}
$$

and the Mie scattering coefficients  $a_{n}$  and  $b_{n}$  are complex functions of  $x$  and  $y = mx,$

$$
\begin{array}{l}{a_n = \frac{\psi_n'(y)\psi_n(x) - m\psi_n(y)\psi_n'(x)}{\psi_n'(y)\zeta_n(x) - m\psi_n(y)\zeta_n'(x)},}\\ {b_n = \frac{m\psi_n'(y)\psi_n(x) - \psi_n(y)\psi_n'(x)}{m\psi_n'(y)\zeta_n(x) - \psi_n(y)\zeta_n'(x)}.} \end{array} \tag{12.20}
$$

The functions  $\psi_{n}$  and  $\zeta_{n}$  are known as Riccati- Bessel functions, and are related to Bessel and Hankel functions [19, 20] by

$$
\psi_{n}(z) = \left(\frac{\pi z}{2}\right)^{1 / 2}J_{n + 1 / 2}(z),\quad \zeta_{n}(z) = \left(\frac{\pi z}{2}\right)^{1 / 2}H_{n + 1 / 2}(z). \tag{12.21}
$$

Equations (12.15) and (12.16) may be substituted into equations (12.11) and (12.14). Using the fact that- - like Legendre polynomials- - the functions  $\pi_{n}$  and  $\tau_{n}$  constitute sets of orthogonal functions leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{Q_{\mathrm{sca}} = \frac{2}{x^2}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}(2n + 1)(a_n|z|^2 +|b_n|^2),}\\ {Q_{\mathrm{ext}} = \frac{2}{x^2}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}(2n + 1)\Re \{a_n + b_n\} .} \end{array} \tag{12.22}
$$

Once all Mie scattering coefficients  $a_{n}$  and  $b_{n}$  have been determined, the phase function  $\Phi$  may also be evaluated from equation (12.13), but this calculation tends to be extremely tedious because of the nature of equation (12.10), and because the calculations must be carried out anew for every scattering angle  $\Phi$ . To facilitate the calculations Chu and Churchill [21, 22] expressed the scattering phase function as a series in Legendre polynomials,

$$
\Phi (\Theta) = 1 + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}A_nP_n(\cos \Theta), \tag{12.24}
$$

where the coefficients  $A_{n}$  are directly related to the Mie scattering coefficients  $a_{n}$  and  $b_{n}$  through some rather complicated formulae not reproduced here. The great advantage of this formulation is that, once the  $A_{n}$  have been determined, the value of the phase function  $\Phi$  is determined quickly for any or all scattering directions.

In many applications the use of the complicated scattering phase function described by equation (12.24) is too involved. For a simpler analysis the directional scattering behavior may be described by the average cosine of the scattering angle, known as the asymmetry factor, and related to the phase function by

$$
g = \overline{\cos\Theta} = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}\Phi (\Theta)\cos \Theta d\Omega . \tag{12.25}
$$

For the case of isotropic scattering (i.e., equal amounts are scattered into all directions, and  $\Phi \equiv 1$ ) the asymmetry factor vanishes;  $g$  also vanishes if scattering is symmetrical about the plane

![](images/49d666a29d263bff7c33fedc295618d434729617fc1fa2049ef82ba33e412f84.jpg)

perpendicular to beam propagation. If the particle scatters more radiation into the forward directions  $(\Theta < \pi /2)$ ,  $g$  is positive; if more radiation is scattered into the backward direction  $(\Theta >\pi /2)$ ,  $g$  is negative. For spherical particles the asymmetry factor is readily calculated [18] as

$$
g = \overline{\cos\Theta} = \frac{4}{x^2Q_{\mathrm{scal}}}\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left[\frac{n(n + 2)}{n + 1}\Re \{a_na_{n + 1}^* +b_nb_{n + 1}^*\} +\frac{2n + 1}{n(n + 1)}\Re \{a_nb_n^*\} \right]. \tag{12.26}
$$

The calculation of the scattering Mie coefficients  $a_{n}$  and  $b_{n}$  is no trivial matter even in these days of supercomputers: The relationships leading to their determination are involved and require the frequent evaluation of complicated functions with complex arguments. For large size parameters  $x$  many terms need to be calculated  $(n_{\mathrm{max}}\approx 2x)$ . Recursion formulae for the functions  $\pi_{n}, \tau_{n}, \psi_{n},$  and  $\zeta_{n}$  have been given by Deirmendjian [17] and others, which evaluate these functions for increasing values of  $n$  in terms of previously calculated functions. Deirmendjian observed that the accuracy of calculations decreases for increasing  $n$ , causing complete failure of the calculations for large values of the size parameter  $x$  (for which many terms are required in the series for the amplitude functions), even if double- precision arithmetic is employed. This problem was overcome by Kattawar and Plass [23] who showed that all four functions may be reduced to functions each belonging to one of two sets: One set has stable recursion formulae for increasing  $n$  (i.e., round- off error decreases with growing  $n$ ), and the other set is stable for decreasing values of  $n$  (setting the function to zero for a larger  $n$  than required in the series results in very accurate values for slightly smaller  $n$ ). Wiscombe [24] compared the accuracy and stability of several Lorenz- Mie scattering computer solution routines and discussed the efficiency of different calculation methods (whether to use upward or downward recursion, what recursion formulae to use, etc.). Some representative results of Lorenz- Mie calculations are shown in Figs. 12- 3 through 12- 5. Figure 12- 3 shows typical behavior of efficiency factors, demonstrated with the extinction efficiency of a dielectric  $(k\equiv 0)$  for a number of different

refractive indices  $n$ . Observe that there is a primary oscillation in the variation of  $Q_{\mathrm{ext}}$  with size parameter, upon which secondary oscillations are superimposed (stronger for larger refractive indices). Note also that the oscillations become smaller for larger size parameters, and  $Q_{\mathrm{ext}} \to 2$  as  $x \to \infty$  (for dielectrics as well as metals). Figure 12- 4 shows the qualitative behavior of efficiency factors for absorption,  $Q_{\mathrm{abs}}$ , and scattering,  $Q_{\mathrm{sca}}$ , respectively, for a fixed value of the size parameter  $(x = 1)$ , as a function of absorptive index  $k$ . The absorption efficiency factors may vary by many orders of magnitude over the range of absorptive index  $k$ , while the scattering efficiency remains constant over great changes of  $k$ . Finally, Fig. 12- 5 shows some representative scattering phase functions,  $\Phi (\Theta)$ . Figure 12- 5a shows the scattering behavior of very small particles (known as Rayleigh scattering): The scattering is symmetric to the plane perpendicular to the incident beam, and is nearly isotropic with slight forward- and backward- scattering peaks and somewhat lesser scattering to the sides. Figure 12- 5b demonstrates the behavior of particles with refractive indices close to unity (known as Rayleigh- Gans scattering): Nearly all of the scattered energy is scattered into forward directions with some scattering into a few preferred other directions. This behavior becomes more extreme as the size parameter increases. Figure 12- 5c shows the phase function of a typical dielectric: The scattering has a strong forward component; otherwise the scattering behavior demonstrates rapid maxima and minima at varying scattering angles, with much stronger amplitudes than for Rayleigh- Gans scattering (note the change in scale). The variations are not quite so extreme as in Fig. 12- 5b owing to the large value for  $n$ . The behavior of a typical metal (aluminum at  $3.1\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) is shown in Fig. 12- 5d: Besides a strong forward- scattering peak these particles display lesser- degree oscillations than dielectrics. These phase functions have been calculated with the author's own code, mmmie, which is included in Appendix F for the convenience of the reader.

# 12.3 RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF A PARTICLE CLOUD

In all problems of radiative heat transfer with particulate scattering and absorption, we have to deal with a large collection of particles. If the scattering is independent, as is assumed in this

![](images/74d361b8b4985f7600fbaf5891fcee21ab66fe62b82fc5da9cdd091c0b440e2f.jpg)  
FIGURE 12-5 Polar plot of scattering phase functions for single spherical particles: (a) small sphere with  $x = 0.001$ ; (b) dielectric with  $x = 5$  and  $m = 1.0001$ ; (c) dielectric sphere with  $x = 10$  and  $m = 2$ ; and (d) metallic sphere (aluminum) with  $x = 10$  and  $m = 4.46 - 31.5i$ .

chapter, then the effects of large numbers of particles are simply additive. For simplicity, it is often assumed that particle clouds consist of spheres that are all equally large. More accurate analyses take into account that particles of many different sizes may occur within a single cloud, and that these sizes often vary by orders of magnitude. We shall briefly describe both approaches in the following paragraphs.

# Clouds of Uniform Size Particles

The fraction of energy scattered by all particles per unit length along the direction of the incoming beam is called the scattering coefficient [as defined by equation (10.6)] and is equal to the scattering cross- section summed over all particles. If  $N_{T}$  is the number of particles per unit volume, all of uniform radius  $a$ , then

$$
\sigma_{s\lambda} = N_{T}C_{\mathrm{sca}} = \pi a^{2}N_{T}Q_{\mathrm{sca}}, \tag{12.27}
$$

and, similarly, for absorption and extinction,

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\kappa_{\lambda} = N_{T}C_{\mathrm{abs}} = \pi a^{2}N_{T}Q_{\mathrm{abs}},}\\ & {\beta_{\lambda} = \kappa_{\lambda} + \sigma_{s\lambda} = N_{T}C_{\mathrm{ext}} = \pi a^{2}N_{T}Q_{\mathrm{ext}}.} \end{array} \tag{12.29}
$$

Since the scattering phase function (or the directional distribution of scattered energy) in a cloud of uniform particles is the same for each particle, it is also the same for the particle cloud, or

$$
\Phi_{T\lambda}(\Theta) = \Phi (\Theta), \tag{12.30}
$$

and similarly for the asymmetry factor,

$$
g_{T\lambda} = \overline{(\cos\Theta)}_{T\lambda} = \overline{\cos\Theta}. \tag{12.31}
$$

In both cases we have temporarily added the subscript  $T$  (to distinguish the total cloud of particles from a single particle) and  $\lambda$  to emphasize the fact that both quantities are spectral quantities that may vary with wavelength.

If total (i.e., spectrally integrated) properties are desired, equations (12.27) through (12.29) may be integrated to obtain Planck- mean or Rosseland- mean coefficients (for absorption, scattering, and/or extinction), as defined by equations (11.182) and (11.188), or

$$
\begin{array}{l}{y_b = \frac{\pi}{\sigma T^4}\int_0^\infty I_{b\lambda}y_\lambda d\lambda ,\qquad y = \kappa ,\sigma_s,\mathrm{or}\beta ,}\\ {\frac{1}{y_b} = \frac{\pi}{4\sigma T^3}\int_0^\infty \frac{1}{y_\lambda}\frac{dI_{b\lambda}}{dT} d\lambda ,\qquad y = \kappa ,\sigma_s,\mathrm{or}\beta .} \end{array} \tag{12.32}
$$

Similarly, total emissivities and absorptivities may be obtained from equation (11.171). Since the efficiency factors  $Q$  may vary rapidly across the spectrum, these integrations generally need to be done numerically.

# Clouds of Nonuniform Size Particles

For clouds of particles of nonuniform size it is customary to describe the number of particles as a function of radius in the form of a particle distribution function. A number of different forms for the distribution function have been used by various researchers. We introduce here the so- called modified gamma distribution [17],

$$
n(a) = A a^{\gamma}\exp (-B a^{\delta}),\quad 0\leq a< \infty , \tag{12.34}
$$

which vanishes at  $a = 0$  and  $a\to \infty$ . This distribution function reduces to the gamma distribution if  $\delta = 1$ . The four constants  $A, B, \gamma ,$  and  $\delta$  are positive and real, and  $\gamma$  and  $\delta$  are usually chosen to be integers. They must be determined from measurable quantities such as total number of particles (per unit volume),

$$
N_{T} = \int_{0}^{\infty}n(a)da = A\int_{0}^{\infty}a^{\gamma}\exp (-Ba^{\delta})da = \frac{A\Gamma\left(\frac{\gamma + 1}{\delta}\right)}{\delta B^{(\gamma + 1) / \delta}}. \tag{12.35}
$$

Here  $\Gamma$  is the gamma function,

$$
\Gamma (z) = \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t}t^{z - 1}dt, \tag{12.36}
$$

and has been tabulated, e.g., by Abramowitz and Stegun [20]. Equation (12.35) shows that the constant  $A$  is essentially given by  $N_{T}$ . The total volume of particles per unit volume, or volume fraction, is given by

$$
f_{v} = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{4}{3}\pi a^{3}n(a)da = \frac{4\pi A\Gamma\left(\frac{\gamma + 4}{\delta}\right)}{3\delta B^{(\gamma + 4) / \delta}}. \tag{12.37}
$$

Assuming that all particles have the same optical properties, we may again determine the scattering coefficient for a particle cloud by adding the scattering cross- section over all particles but, because of the particle size distribution, this is now an integral rather than a simple sum,

$$
\alpha_{\lambda} = \int_{0}^{\infty}C_{\mathrm{sca}}n(a)da = \pi \int_{0}^{\infty}Q_{\mathrm{sca}}a^{2}n(a)da, \tag{12.38}
$$

and, similarly, for absorption and extinction,

$$
\begin{array}{r} \begin{array}{r}\kappa_{\lambda} = \int_{0}^{\infty}C_{\mathrm{abs}}n(a)da = \pi \int_{0}^{\infty}Q_{\mathrm{abs}}a^{2}n(a)da,\\ \beta_{\lambda} = \int_{0}^{\infty}C_{\mathrm{ext}}n(a)da = \pi \int_{0}^{\infty}Q_{\mathrm{ext}}a^{2}n(a)da. \end{array} \end{array} \tag{12.40}
$$

FIGURE 12-6 Lorenz-Mie scattering phase function for clouds of absorbing particles [25].

For nonuniform particles the scattering phase function is not the same for all particles. From the definition of the phase function, it follows that the scattered energies into a given direction must be summed over all particles and then normalized, or

$$
\begin{array}{l}\Phi_{T\lambda}(\Theta) = \frac{\int_0^\infty(i_1 + i_2)n(a)da}{\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}^\infty\left[\int_0^\infty(i_1 + i_2)n(a)da\right]d\Omega} = \frac{\int_0^\infty C_{\mathrm{sca}}(a)\Phi(a,\Theta)n(a)da}{\int_0^\infty C_{\mathrm{sca}}(a)n(a)da}\\ \displaystyle = \frac{1}{\sigma_{s\lambda}}\int_0^\infty C_{\mathrm{sca}}(a)\Phi (a,\Theta)n(a)da, \end{array} \tag{12.41}
$$

and, similarly,

$$
g_{T\lambda} = \overline{(\cos\Theta)}_{T\lambda} = \frac{1}{\sigma_{s\lambda}}\int_{0}^{\infty}C_{\mathrm{sca}}(a)g(a)n(a)da. \tag{12.42}
$$

Again, if total properties are needed, equations (12.38) through (12.40) may be integrated over the entire spectrum.

Figures 12- 6 and 12- 7 show a few typical scattering phase functions for absorbing and nonabsorbing particle clouds, calculated with program mmmie of Appendix F. Two types of particles are considered, one nonabsorbing with an index of refraction  $m = 2$ , the other one absorbing with  $m = 2 - i$ . The particles are either in clouds of constant radius  $a = 5\mu \mathrm{m}$ , or in clouds with a distribution function

$$

which has its maximum at  $a = 5\mu \mathrm{m}$ . All the particle clouds have a number density of  $10^{4}$  particles  $\mathrm{cm}^3$ , and the Lorenz- Mie calculations have been carried out for a typical wavelength of  $\lambda = 3.1416\mu \mathrm{m}$ , resulting in a size parameter of  $x = 2\pi a / \lambda = 10$  for the constant- radius clouds, and a range of significant size parameters of  $0< x\leq 20$  for clouds with particle size distribution.

clouds differ considerably, primarily because the average particle size in equation (12.43) is less than  $5\mu \mathrm{m}$ , being  $2.33\mu \mathrm{m}$  for the volume- or mass- averaged radius, and  $1.52\mu \mathrm{m}$  for the number- averaged radius. Observe that the phase functions for uniform particle size clouds display strong oscillations due to diffraction peaks, because the phase function is identical to the one of single particles (cf. Fig. 12- 5). Since the diffraction peaks shift slightly with changing size parameters, these peaks and valleys are smoothed out for clouds with varying particle sizes. For these types of clouds the phase function becomes very smooth with only a strong forward- scattering peak remaining (plus a weaker backward- scattering peak for dielectric particles). Thus, the analysis of scattering phenomena may actually be simpler if there is a particle size distribution! Figures 12- 6 and 12- 7 also shows linear anisotropic approximations to these phase functions, as discussed in Section 12.9.

Bohren and Huffman [18] have shown that this smoothing effect occurs for the efficiency factors as well as for the phase function, requiring only a small deviation from uniform- size parti

![](images/427263ea97bb9fef4866efc8d6bfbf324c13c57b06290288b6c3e38df79a273e.jpg)

cles to be present. Figure 12- 8 shows the extinction efficiency for clouds of water droplets, which are assumed to have a Gaussian distribution function centered around a mean particle size with standard deviation  $\sigma$ . Small deviations from uniform size blur out the high- frequency variation (called the ripple structure), while slightly larger deviations also dampen out the low- frequency variations of the extinction efficiency (called the interference structure). Similar smoothing effects occur in a cloud of uniform- size particles of irregular shape as shown by Hodkinson [26] for aqueous suspensions of irregular quartz particles.

# 12.4 RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF SMALL SPHERES (RAYLEIGH SCATTERING)

Radiative scattering by spheres that are small compared with wavelength was first described by Lord Rayleigh [10, 11] long before the development of Mie's theory [14]. However, results for small particles are here most easily obtained by taking the appropriate limits in the general solution to Mie's equations.

If the scattering particles are extremely small, then the size parameter  $x = 2\pi a / \lambda$  becomes very small. Such behavior is primarily observed with gas molecules (which are, in fact, very tiny particles). There are, however, also some multimolecule solid particles that fall into the Rayleigh scattering regime, e.g., soot particles (whose diameters are often smaller than  $10\mathrm{nm}$  and which, in combustion applications, are irradiated by light of approximately  $3\mu \mathrm{m}$ , resulting in  $x\approx 0.01$ ).

In the limit of  $x\rightarrow 0$  it is relatively straightforward to show that only the  $a_1$  in equations (12.19) and (12.20) is nonzero, or

$$
S_{2}(\Theta) = S_{1}(\Theta)\cos \Theta = i\frac{m^{2} - 1}{m^{2} + 2} x^{3}\cos \Theta , \tag{12.44}
$$

that is, the amplitude function for one polarization is independent of scattering angle  $\Theta$ . Substitution into equations (12.11) and (12.14) then gives the efficiency factors as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{Q_{\mathrm{sca}} = \frac{8}{3}\bigg|\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2}\bigg|^2 x^4,}\\ {Q_{\mathrm{abs}} = -4\Im \bigg\{\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2}\bigg\} x\approx Q_{\mathrm{ext}},} \end{array} \tag{12.46}
$$

![](images/82ec87903a4ccb473ac20b3f9ae34d30f29e904aa16b40694840087aba20be2b.jpg)  
FIGURE 12-9 Distance traveled through Earth's atmosphere by solar rays.

where the last equality in equation (12.46) is due to the fact that  $x^4 \ll x$ , so that scattering may be neglected as compared with absorption. We observe the wavelength dependence of the scattering efficiency to be

$$
Q_{\mathrm{sca}}\propto \frac{1}{\lambda^4}\propto \nu^4. \tag{12.47}
$$

We note in passing that this fact explains the colors of the sky: During most of the day, when the sun's rays travel a relatively short distance through Earth's atmosphere (cf. Fig. 12- 9), only the shortest wavelengths are scattered away in any appreciable amounts from the sun's direct path; they are scattered again and again by the molecules in the atmosphere, providing us with a blue sky (blue light having the shortest wavelength within the visible spectrum). Close to sunset, however, the sun's rays travel at a grazing angle through the atmosphere to the observer, so that all but the very longest wavelengths (of the visible spectrum) have been scattered away from the direct path, giving the sun a red appearance. Without the atmosphere the sky would appear black to us, as witnessed by the astronauts visiting the (atmosphere- less) moon.

The wavelength dependence of the absorption efficiency, on the other hand, is

$$
Q_{\mathrm{abs}}\propto \frac{1}{\lambda}\propto \nu , \tag{12.48}
$$

which describes the spectral behavior of small particles such as soot reasonably well.

The phase function for Rayleigh scattering follows from equations (12.44) and (12.13) as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\Phi (\Theta) = \frac{3}{4} (1 + \cos^2\Theta), \end{array} \tag{12.49}
$$

where the two terms are the contributions from the two perpendicular polarizations, as shown in Fig. 12- 10. It is observed that the phase function is symmetric as far as forward and backward scattering is concerned, and does not deviate too strongly from isotropic scattering.

The absorption coefficient for a cloud of nonuniform- size small particles follows from equations (12.39) and (12.46) as

$$
\kappa_{\lambda} = \pi \int_{0}^{\infty}Q_{\mathrm{abs}}a^{2}n(a)da = -4\Im \left\{\frac{m^{2} - 1}{m^{2} + 2}\right\} \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{2\pi a}{\lambda}\right)\pi a^{2}n(a)da. \tag{12.50}
$$

The integral in this equation may be related to the volume fraction  $f_v$ ,

$$
f_{v} = \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi a^{3}\right)n(a)da, \tag{12.51}
$$

![](images/a0f21453ae3e55126bada058f1d9dbd474335948d423a6936c1d1337ecc25b35.jpg)  
FIGURE 12-30Polar diagram of Rayleigh phase function: 1, polarized with electric vector in plane perpendicular to paper; 2, polarized in plane of paper; 1+2, unpolarized.

so that the absorption coefficient for small particles reduces to

$$
\kappa_{\lambda} = -\Im \left\{\frac{m^{2} - 1}{m^{2} + 2}\right\} \frac{6\pi f_{v}}{\lambda}, \tag{12.52}
$$

or, expanding the complex index of refraction,  $m = n - ik,$

$$
\kappa_{\lambda} = \frac{36\pi nk}{(n^{2} - k^{2} + 2)^{2} + 4n^{2}k^{2}}\frac{f_{v}}{\lambda}. \tag{12.53}
$$

Therefore, for particles small enough that Rayleigh scattering holds, the absorption coefficient does not depend on particle size distribution, but only on the total volume occupied by all particles (per unit system volume).

Example 12.1. During the burning of propane it is observed that the products contain a volume fraction of  $10^{- 4}\%$  of soot with complex index of refraction  $m = 2.21 - 1.23i$  (measured at a wavelength of  $3\mu \mathrm{m}$ ). Assuming a mean particle diameter of  $0.05\mu \mathrm{m}$ , determine the absorption and scattering efficiency of this soot cloud as well as its absorption coefficient, all at a wavelength of  $3\mu \mathrm{m}$ .

# Solution

For the given diameter and wavelength the particle size parameter is  $x = \pi \times 0.05\mu \mathrm{m} / 3\mu \mathrm{m} = 0.0524\ll 1$  and we assume Rayleigh scattering to hold for all particles. For all three properties we need to evaluate the complex ratio  $(m^{2} - 1)$ $(m^{2} + 2)$

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2} = \frac{2.21^2 - 2\times 2.21\times 1.23i - 1.23^2 - 1}{2.21^2 - 2\times 2.21\times 1.23i - 1.23^2 + 2}}\\ {= \frac{2.3712 - 5.4366i}{5.3712 - 5.4366i}\times \frac{5.3712 + 5.4366i}{5.3712 + 5.4366i}}\\ {= \frac{42.2928 - 16.3098i}{58.4064} = 0.7241 - 0.2792i.} \end{array}
$$

Thus, the efficiencies can be evaluated as

$$
Q_{\mathrm{sca}} = \frac{8}{3} |0.7241 - 0.2792i|^2\times (0.0524)^4 = 1.21\times 10^{-5},
$$

and

$$
Q_{\mathrm{abs}} = -4\times (-0.2792)\times 0.0524 = 5.85\times 10^{-2},
$$

showing that scattering may indeed be neglected compared with absorption. The absorption coefficient follows from equation (12.53) as

$$
\kappa_{\lambda} = -(-0.2792)\times \frac{6\pi\times 10^{-4} / 100}{3\times 10^{-4}\mathrm{cm}} = 0.01754\mathrm{cm}^{-1},
$$

that is, any radiation (at  $3\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) penetrating into such a soot cloud would be attenuated to  $1 / e$  of its original intensity over a distance of  $1 / \kappa_{\lambda} = 57\mathrm{cm}$ .

# 12.5 RAYLEIGH-GANS SCATTERING

A near- dielectric sphere with  $k > 0$  and with a refractive index close to unity, i.e.,  $|m - 1|\ll 1$ , has negligible reflectivity and, thus, lets light pass into the sphere unattenuated and unrefracted. If also  $x|m - 1|\ll 1$ , then the light will exit the sphere again essentially unattenuated. However, since the phase velocity of light is slightly less inside the particle, light traveling through the sphere will display a small phase lag as opposed to the incident light. This phenomenon is known as Rayleigh- Gans scattering.

As described by van de Hulst [3], taking the appropriate limits reduces equations (12.15) and (12.16) to

$$
S_{2}(\Theta) = S_{1}(\Theta)\cos \Theta = ix^{3}(m - 1)G(u)\cos \Theta , \tag{12.54}
$$

where

$$
G(u) = \frac{2}{u^3} (\sin u - u\cos u),\qquad u = 2x\sin \frac{1}{2}\Theta . \tag{12.55}
$$

The absorption efficiency is identical to the one for Rayleigh scattering, that is,

$$
Q_{\mathrm{abs}} = -4\Im \left\{\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2}\right\} x, \tag{12.56}
$$

while the scattering efficiency turns out to be

$$
Q_{\mathrm{sea}} = |m - 1|^2 x^4\int_0^\pi G^2 (u)(1 + \cos^2\Theta)\sin \Theta d\Theta . \tag{12.57}
$$

Finally, the phase function for Rayleigh- Gans scattering is now easily determined as

$$
\Phi (\Theta) = \frac{2G^2(u)(1 + \cos^2\Theta)}{\int_0^\pi G^2(u)(1 + \cos^2\Theta)\sin\Theta d\Theta}. \tag{12.58}
$$

An example of this phase function is included in Fig.  $12 - 5b$  for  $x = 5$  and  $m = 1.0001$ . The phase function displays a strong forward- scattering peak (which increases with increasing size parameter), with very rapid oscillations of varying amplitude into the other directions.

# 12.6 ANOMALOUS DIFFRACTION

Simple relations for near- dielectric spheres,  $|m - 1|\ll 1$ , can also be obtained for arbitrary values of  $x|m - 1|$ , provided the particles are large,  $x\gg 1$ . This allows separation of (approximately straight) transmission and diffraction, and is called anomalous diffraction by van de Hulst [3]. For this limiting case the efficiency factors are found from

$$
\begin{array}{l}{Q_{\mathrm{ext}} = 4\Re \left\{K\big(2x(m - 1)i\big)\right\}}\\ {= 2 - \frac{4}{p}\cos q\bigg[e^{-p\tan q}\bigg(\sin (p - q) + \frac{\cos q}{p}\cos (p - 2q)\bigg) - \frac{\cos q}{p}\cos 2q\bigg],}\\ {Q_{\mathrm{abs}} = 2K(2p\tan q),} \end{array} \tag{12.60}
$$

where

$$
K(w) = \frac{1}{2} -\frac{1}{w^2}\left[1 - (1 + w)e^{-w}\right], \tag{12.61}
$$

$$
p = 2x(n - 1),\quad q = \tan^{-1}\frac{k}{n - 1};\quad p\tan q = 2xk. \tag{12.62}
$$

Physically,  $p$  represents the phase lag experienced by a ray that passes through the center of the sphere. Similar to Rayleigh- Gans scattering, many nonmetallic particles present during combustion come reasonably close to satisfying the  $|m - 1| \ll 1$  conditions.

# 12.7 RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF LARGE SPHERES

If the spheres are very large  $(x \gg 1)$ , very many terms are required in the evaluation of equations (12.15) and (12.16). However, in this case it is sufficient to resort to geometric optics, and one may separate diffraction from reflection and refraction. For very large spheres it is always true that

$$
Q_{\mathrm{ext}} = 2. \tag{12.63}
$$

This relationship is sometimes called the extinction paradox since it states that a large particle removes exactly twice the amount of light from the beam as it can intercept, and has been discussed by van de Hulst [3]. Since, for geometric optics, the projected area of a particle for reflection and absorption is  $\pi a^2$ , this means that half of the extinction efficiency is due to diffraction. How much of the rest is due to absorption, and how much due to reflection, depends on the value of the complex index of refraction  $m$ , or the reflectivity of the sphere's surface.

In the following we shall determine the scattering properties of large- opaque spheres, i.e., such spheres for which any ray refracted into the particle will be totally absorbed within, without exiting the sphere at another location. This requires the additional assumption that  $kx \gg 1$  (say, 2 or 3). Thus,  $k$  may be fairly small as long as  $x \gg 1$ . A consequence of this is that, for a metal, "large particle" may mean  $x > 10$ , while for a near- dielectric it may mean  $x > 10,000$ .

While electromagnetic wave theory always assumes optically smooth surfaces, resulting in specular reflection, very large spheres (as compared with wavelength) may have roughness levels at the sphere's surface that are also large as compared with wavelength, resulting in nonspecular reflection. Treatment of very irregular directional behavior for the reflectance is, of course, extremely difficult (as it was for surface transport, cf. Chapter 7). However, the extreme case of perfectly diffuse reflection lends itself to straightforward analysis (similar to the treatment of surface transport in Chapter 5), and is, therefore, also included in the present section.

# Diffraction from Large Spheres

The diffraction pattern of light passing through the vicinity of a large sphere is, by Babinet's principle, equal to that of a circular hole with the same diameter [3]. As a consequence the directional behavior of the diffracted light consists of alternating bright and dark rings. The amplitude functions for diffraction have been given by van de Hulst [3] as

$$
S_{1}(\Theta) = S_{2}(\Theta) = x\frac{J_{1}(x\sin\Theta)}{\sin\Theta}, \tag{12.64}
$$

where  $J_{1}$  is a Bessel function [19]. Therefore, the phase function for diffraction over a large sphere follows from equation (12.13) (noting that  $Q_{\mathrm{sca}} = 1$  for diffraction) as

$$
\Phi (\Theta) = 2\frac{i_1 + i_2}{x^2} = 4\frac{J_1^2(x\sin\Theta)}{\sin^2\Theta}. \tag{12.65}
$$

This phase function, depicted in Fig. 12- 11, demonstrates that almost all energy is scattered forward within a narrow cone of  $\Theta < (150 / x)^{\circ}$  from the direction of transmission. Thus, in heat

![](images/321a82e664391036f9286d17ddac61fa74f957eea03fb88500e0a05edeaddf3e.jpg)  
FIGURE 12-11 Phase function for diffraction over a large sphere.

transfer applications we may usually neglect diffraction and treat it as transmission. Then, for large particles without diffraction,

$$
Q_{\mathrm{ext}} = 1. \tag{12.66}
$$

# Large Specularly Reflecting Spheres

Consider a specularly reflecting opaque sphere irradiated by an intensity  $I_{i}$  distributed over a thin pencil of rays of solid angle  $d\Omega_{i}$  as shown in Fig. 12- 12. Under these conditions the infinitesimal band at an angle  $\beta$  from the incident direction (indicated by shading in the figure) receives radiation from a direction which is off- normal (from its surface) by an angle  $\beta$ . Recalling the definition of intensity as "heat rate per unit area normal to the rays, per unit solid angle, and per unit wavelength," the energy intercepted by the band over a wavelength range of  $d\lambda$  is

$$
d^{2}Q_{i} = I_{i}d\Omega_{i}d\lambda (dA_{\mathrm{band}}\cos \beta) = I_{i}d\Omega_{i}d\lambda 2\pi a\sin \beta a d\beta \cos \beta . \tag{12.67}
$$

Of that, the fraction  $\rho^{s}(\beta)$  is reflected into the direction  $2\beta$  as measured from the incoming pencil of rays. The total heat rate intercepted by the sphere is

$$
dQ_{i} = \int_{0}^{\pi /2}I_{i}d\Omega_{i}d\lambda 2\pi a^{2}\sin \beta \cos \beta d\beta = I_{i}d\Omega_{i}d\lambda \pi a^{2}, \tag{12.68}
$$

while the total reflected (or scattered) heat rate is

$$
\begin{array}{l}{dQ_s = \int_0^{\pi /2}\rho^s (\beta)I_id\Omega_id\lambda 2\pi a^2\sin \beta \cos \beta d\beta}\\ {= I_id\Omega_id\lambda \pi a^2 2\int_0^{\pi /2}\rho^s (\beta)\sin \beta \cos \beta d\beta = \rho^s I_id\Omega_id\lambda \pi a^2,} \end{array} \tag{12.69}
$$

where  $\rho^{s}$  is the hemispherical reflectance, averaged over all incoming directions [cf. equation (3.46)]:

$$
\rho^s = 2\int_0^{\pi /2}\rho^s (\beta)\sin \beta \cos \beta d\beta . \tag{12.70}
$$

![](images/e1603b4519302b43e8edda834a867720938bf5c08bcbd2936c9428118488acab.jpg)  
FIGURE 12-12 Scattering of incident radiation by a large specularly reflecting sphere.

Thus, the scattering efficiency for a large, opaque, specularly reflecting particle is simply

$$
Q_{\mathrm{sca}} = \frac{dQ_s}{dQ_i} = \rho^s, \tag{12.71}
$$

and the absorption efficiency follows as

$$
Q_{\mathrm{abs}} = Q_{\mathrm{ext}} - Q_{\mathrm{sca}} = 1 - \rho^s = \alpha , \tag{12.72}
$$

that is, the hemispherical absorptivity.

To evaluate the scattering phase function we consider the amount of energy scattered into any given direction  $\Theta$ , where  $\Theta$  is measured from the transmission direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , as also indicated in Fig. 12- 12. It is clear that, for a homogeneous sphere, the scattered intensity can only vary with the polar angle  $\Theta$  (and not azimuthally). Furthermore, for a specularly reflecting sphere the outgoing intensity in a certain direction  $\Theta$  can only come from a single position on the sphere's surface. For example, radiation scattered into the direction  $\Theta = \pi - 2\beta$  comes from the shaded band in Fig. 12- 12. Recalling that the scattering phase function is defined as  $4\pi \times$  scattered intensity/total scattered heat flux [cf. equation (10.15)] we get, for  $\Theta = \pi - 2\beta$  or  $\beta = (\pi - \Theta) / 2$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l}\Phi (\Theta) = 4\pi \frac{\rho^s(\beta)d^2Q_i / d\Omega_r}{dQ_s}\\ \displaystyle = 4\pi \rho^s\left(\frac{\pi - \Theta}{2}\right)\frac{I_id\Omega_id\lambda 2\pi a^2\sin\beta\cos\beta d\beta / d\Omega_r}{\rho^sI_id\Omega_id\lambda\pi a^2}. \end{array} \tag{12.73}
$$

The solid angle for the reflection is best visualized by letting the reflected intensity fall upon a concentric (and very large) sphere of radius  $R$ . The solid angle is then the area of the illuminated band divided by  $R^2$ , or

$$
d\Omega_{r} = 2\pi \sin 2\beta d(2\beta), \tag{12.74}
$$

leading to

$$
\Phi (\Theta) = \rho^s\left(\frac{\pi - \Theta}{2}\right)\bigg / \rho^s. \tag{12.75}
$$

Alternatively, we could use the fact that the scattering phase function is proportional to intensity into any given direction, and then normalize the resulting expression with equation (10.17). The

![](images/88bb3a9608f06ef5356e9ce127404f202f734d6f9dca7ba06ca0124de59e3cb9.jpg)  
FIGURE 12-13 Scattering phase functions for large spheres of various materials.

actual directional scattering behavior (or the behavior of the phase function) depends on the material of which the particles are made. Figure 12- 13 shows a comparison of the phase function between a "typical" metal (aluminum at  $3.1\mu \mathrm{m}$  with an index of refraction of  $m = 4.46 - 31.5i)$  and a "typical" dielectric  $(m = 2)$ . These two phase functions should be compared with Fig.  $12 - 5c,d,$  which are for identical materials but for a smaller size parameter (and are shown in a polar rather than a Cartesian plot). Since the size parameter in Fig.  $12 - 5c,d$  is fairly large  $(x = 10)$ , the major difference between Fig.  $12 - 5c,d$  and Fig. 12- 13 lies in the omission of diffraction in Fig. 12- 13. For large particles all materials have their maximum scattering into the forward direction,  $\Theta = 0$ , since  $\rho^5 (\pi /2) = 1$  always. However, this peak is considerably more pronounced for dielectrics, and is hardly noticeable for the metal because of the dip in reflectance at near- grazing angles (compare also Fig. 2- 11, which shows the directional variation of the reflectance of aluminum). Because of their relatively high reflectance at all directions, large metallic particles tend to be almost isotropic scatterers.

Example 12.2. Consider glass particles with a complex index of refraction  $m = 1.5 - 0.1i$  and a density of  $\rho_{\mathrm{glass}} = 2\mathrm{g} / \mathrm{cm}^3$ , suspended in an inert gas, with a particle loading ratio of  $1\mathrm{kg}$  of particles per  $\mathrm{m}^3$  of suspension volume. Particle sizes range between  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $1000\mu \mathrm{m}$ , with an equal distribution over all sizes by weight%. Determine the absorption coefficient, the scattering coefficient, and the phase function for the infrared  $(3\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < 10\mu \mathrm{m})$

# Solution

First, we need to determine the particle distribution function by number (rather than mass). Since the mass distribution function is a constant we get

$$
\begin{array}{l}{m(a) = \frac{1\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^3}{(1000 - 100)\mu\mathrm{m}} = \frac{4}{3}\pi a^3\rho_{\mathrm{glass}}n(a),\quad 100\mu \mathrm{m}\leq a\leq 1000\mu \mathrm{m},}\\ {n(a) = \frac{3m(a)}{4\pi a^3\rho_{\mathrm{glass}}} = 1.3226\times 10^{-7}\mu \mathrm{m}^{-1} / a^3,\quad 100\mu \mathrm{m}\leq a\leq 1000\mu \mathrm{m}.} \end{array}
$$

Next we need to determine the range of the size parameter  $x$  to see whether Rayleigh scattering, Lorenz- Mie scattering, or large- particle scattering must be considered. The minimum value for  $x$  will occur for the smallest particle at the longest wavelength, or

$$
x_{\mathrm{min}} = \frac{2\pi a_{\mathrm{min}}}{\lambda_{\mathrm{max}}} = \frac{2\pi 100}{10} = 62.83\gg 1,
$$

$$
(kx)_{\mathrm{min}} = 6.283\gg 1,
$$

that is, the large- particle assumption will be acceptable for all conditions encountered in this example. Thus, the absorption and scattering coefficients may be related to the hemispherical emissivity of the glass. Since for this glass  $k\ll n$ , the material behaves essentially like a dielectric, and the hemispherical emissivity may be found from Fig. 3- 19 or equation (3.82). Either method leads to  $\epsilon = \alpha = 1 - \rho = 0.91$ . The absorption and scattering coefficients may then be calculated from equations (12.39) and (12.38) as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\kappa_{\lambda} = \pi \int_{0}^{\infty}\alpha a^{2}n(a)da = \pi \alpha \int_{100\mu \mathrm{m}}^{1000\mu \mathrm{m}}a^{2}\frac{1.3226\times 10^{-7}}{\mu\mathrm{m}a^{3}} da}\\ {= 1.3226\times 10^{-7}\mu \mathrm{m}^{-1}\pi \alpha \ln \frac{1000}{100} = 9.60\times 10^{-3}\alpha \mathrm{cm}^{-1}}\\ {= 8.74\times 10^{-3}\mathrm{cm}^{-1},}\\ {\alpha_{s\lambda} = 9.60\times 10^{-3}\rho \mathrm{cm}^{-1} = 0.86\times 10^{-3}\mathrm{cm}^{-1}.} \end{array}
$$

The scattering phase function must be evaluated from equation (12.75) and is also included in Fig. 12- 13. Because of the small value for  $k$ , the directional behavior is very similar to that of the perfect dielectric  $(m = 2)$ , but the forward- scattering peak is more pronounced because of the smaller refractive index.

# Large Diffusely Reflecting Spheres

In equations (12.67) through (12.72) the directional characteristics of the sphere reflectance did not enter the development. Thus, for a diffusely reflecting sphere the amount of incident radiation on a surface element, as well as the expression for the heat flux reflected into all directions, is the same as for a specularly reflecting sphere. Therefore, equations (12.67) through (12.72) also hold for the diffusely reflecting sphere, or

$$
\begin{array}{r}Q_{\mathsf{abs}} = \alpha ,\\ Q_{\mathsf{sca}} = \rho . \end{array} \tag{12.77}
$$

However, while for a specularly reflecting sphere the energy scattered into any given direction resulted from reflection from a single location on the sphere's surface, this is not true for a diffusely reflecting sphere. This complicates the development for the scattering phase function a bit. Consider Fig. 12- 14: Incident radiation traveling into the direction of the unit vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  illuminates one half of the diffusely reflecting sphere. An observer, located far away from the sphere in the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o$ , sees a different half of the sphere, part of which is illuminated by the incident radiation (shown by shadowing), part of which is in the shade. This illuminated region seen by the observer has the shape of a circular wedge similar to a slice of lemon. To describe the surface in polar coordinates it is most convenient to define the plane formed by the two unit vectors  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o$  to be the  $x - y$ - plane with polar angle  $\beta$  measured from the  $z$ - axis and the azimuthal angle  $\psi$  measured from the negative  $x$ - axis as indicated in Fig. 12- 14. With this coordinate system the normal to a surface element in the illuminated region may be expressed as

$$
\hat{\mathbf{n}} (\beta ,\psi) = -\sin \beta \cos \psi \hat{\mathbf{1}} +\sin \beta \sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{1}} +\cos \beta \hat{\mathbf{k}}, \tag{12.78}
$$

and also

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i = \hat{\mathbf{1}},\qquad \hat{\mathbf{s}}_o = \cos \Theta \hat{\mathbf{1}} +\sin \Theta \hat{\mathbf{1}}. \tag{12.79}
$$

The energy reflected from an infinitesimal surface area is, as developed in equation (12.67),

$$
d^2 Q_s = \rho I_i d\Omega_i d\lambda [dA(-\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)], \tag{12.80}
$$

where  $dA$  is two- dimensionally infinitesimal as indicated in Fig. 12- 14 (i.e., not a ring as in the previous section, Fig. 12- 12). Thus, the radiosity at that location, because of diffuse reflection of incident radiation, is

$$
dJ = \rho I_i d\Omega_i d\lambda (-\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i). \tag{12.81}
$$

![](images/f7f555fca1ff09c14a8683b6f47d729c1f217b7373d97bb1aa356484d9251f5b.jpg)  
FIGURE 12-14 Scattering of incident radiation by a large diffusely reflecting sphere.

Some of the reflected radiation will travel toward the observer into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_0$ . If we assume the observer stands on a large sphere with radius  $R \gg a$ , then the heat flux through a surface element  $dA_{R}$  on the large sphere due to reflection from the small sphere is

$$
dI_{s}d\Omega = \int_{A_{\mathrm{shaded}}}dJdF_{dA - dA_{R}}dA_{i} \tag{12.82}
$$

where

$$
dF_{dA - dA_R} = \frac{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o dA_R}{\pi R^2} = \frac{1}{\pi}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_o d\Omega \tag{12.83}
$$

is the view factor between  $dA$  and  $dA_{R}, \hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{o}$  is the cosine of the angle between the surface normal at  $dA$  and the line to  $dA_{R}$ , while the surface normal at  $dA_{R}$  points directly to the particle. Thus,

$$
dI_{s} = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{A_{\mathrm{shaded}}}dJ\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{o}dA, \tag{12.84}
$$

and, again recalling that the scattering phase function is equal to  $4\pi \times$  scattered intensity/total scattered heat flux, we get

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o) = 4\pi dI_s / d\Omega_s = 4\int_{A_{\mathrm{shaded}}}(\rho I_i d\Omega_i d\lambda)(-\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_o)dA / \rho I_i d\Omega_i d\lambda \pi a^2}\\ {= \frac{4}{\pi a^2}\int_{A_{\mathrm{shaded}}}(-\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_o)dA}\\ {= \frac{4}{\pi a^2}\int_{\frac{\pi}{2} -\Theta}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\int_0^\pi \sin \beta \cos \psi \sin \beta (\sin \psi \sin \Theta -\cos \psi \cos \Theta)a^2\sin \beta d\beta d\psi ,} \end{array}
$$

which may readily be integrated to yield

$$
\Phi (\Theta) = \frac{8}{3\pi} (\sin \Theta -\Theta \cos \Theta). \tag{12.85}
$$

The phase function for diffuse spheres, equation (12.85), is also depicted in Fig. 12- 13. Unlike for specularly reflecting spheres, the phase function for diffusely reflecting spheres displays a strong backward- scattering peak, and it is independent of the reflectance (or the complex index of refraction) of the materials.

FIGURE 12-15 Scattering of incident radiation by a long cylinder.

# Particle Beds

The scattering regime map of Fig. 12- 2 suggests that independent scattering may be assumed for packed and fluidized beds with particle volume fractions as large as 0.7 [5]. However, the classical continuum theory for radiative transfer in particulate media is based on the assumption of infinitesimally small particle size and, thus, negligible shading. Particle beds generally contain relatively large particles  $(x \gg 1)$  and, combined with large volume fractions, shading can no longer be ignored [27]. Brewster [28] proposed a simple correction to equation (12.29) as

$$
\beta_{\lambda} = \frac{\pi a^{2}N_{T}Q_{\mathrm{ext}}}{1 - f_{v}} = \frac{3f_{v}}{(1 - f_{v})a}, \tag{12.86}
$$

where uniform particle size has been assumed, and  $Q_{\mathrm{ext}} = 1$  for large particles. Comparison with stochastic Monte Carlo simulations [27] showed near- perfect agreement. Another, more recent ray tracing algorithm for densely packed spheres also attests to the accuracy of equation (12.86) [29].

# 12.8 ABSORPTION AND SCATTERING BY LONG CYLINDERS

Scattering from cylinders has been studied for almost as long as that from spheres, starting with Lord Rayleigh looking at infinitely long cylinders at normal incidence. In the area of radiative heat transfer scattering from cylinders has become of interest only very recently, to predict transfer rates through optical fibers and fibrous insulation.

Consider a cylinder of length  $L$  and radius  $a$ , with its axis pointed into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_f$ , that is irradiated obliquely by electromagnetic waves propagating into direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  as indicated in Fig. 12- 15. For cylinders it is common to define the angle of incidence with respect to the normal to the cylinder axis, i.e.,  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_f = \sin \phi$  as shown. Similar to waves impinging obliquely on flat surfaces (see Chapter 2), we need to distinguish between two polarization components: the transverse magnetic (TM, or "Case I"; no magnetic vector component in the  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_f$ - direction) mode, and the transverse electric (TE, or "Case II"; no electric vector component in the  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_f$ - direction) mode. For short cylinders the scattering behavior is very similar to that of spheres, but with increasing  $L / a$ - ratio scattering becomes more and more confined to a conical surface (rather than being spread out over all 4π solid angles).

For infinitely long cylinders  $(L / a\rightarrow \infty)$  all scattering is confined to the conical surface described by  $\hat{\mathbf{S}}_f$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{S}}$  as indicated in Fig. 12- 15. The nondimensional polarized scattering intensities can be calculated for this case as [16]

$$
\begin{array}{l}{i_{11}(m,x,\phi ,\theta) = |T_{11}|^2 = \left|b_{01} + 2\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}b_{n1}\cos n\theta \right|^2,}\\ {i_{12}(m,x,\phi ,\theta) = |T_{12}|^2 = \left|2\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}a_{n1}\sin n\theta \right|^2,}\\ {i_{21}(m,x,\phi ,\theta) = |T_{21}|^2 = \left|2\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}b_{n1}\sin n\theta \right|^2,}\\ {i_{22}(m,x,\phi ,\theta) = |T_{22}|^2 = \left|a_{011} + 2\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}a_{n1}\cos n\theta \right|^2.} \end{array} \tag{12.87d}
$$

As for spheres the  $a_{n}$  and  $b_{n}$  can be expressed in terms of Bessel and Hankel functions, and are given by Kerker [16]. For unpolarized incident radiation the nondimensional intensity is evaluated as

$$
i(m,x,\phi ,\theta) = \frac{1}{2} (i_{11} + i_{12} + i_{21} + i_{22});\qquad i_{12} = i_{21}, \tag{12.88}
$$

and extinction and scattering cross- sections and efficiencies are evaluated from

$$
\begin{array}{l}{Q_{\mathrm{ext}} = \frac{C_{\mathrm{ext}}}{2a} = \frac{2}{x}\Re \big(\tau (\theta = 0)\big) = \frac{1}{x}\Re \left\{i_{0\mathrm{II}} + a_{0\mathrm{II}} + 2\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(b_{n\mathrm{I}} + a_{n\mathrm{II}}\right)\right\}}\\ {Q_{\mathrm{sca}} = \frac{C_{\mathrm{sca}}}{2a} = \frac{1}{\pi x}\int_{0}^{2\pi}i\left(m,x,\phi ,\theta\right)d\theta}\\ {= \frac{1}{x}\left\{\left|b_{0\mathrm{II}}\right|^2 +\left|a_{0\mathrm{II}}\right|^2 +\sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}\left(\left|b_{n\mathrm{II}}\right|^2 +\left|b_{n\mathrm{II}}\right|^2 +\left|a_{n\mathrm{II}}\right|^2 +\left|a_{n\mathrm{II}}\right|^2\right)\right\} ,} \end{array} \tag{12.90}
$$

where, as for spheres,  $x = 2\pi a / \lambda$ , but cross- sections are per unit length of cylinder (i.e., have units of length). The phase function for a single, infinite cylinder is given by [30]

$$
\Phi (\Theta ,\phi) = \frac{i(\theta,\phi)\delta(\phi - \phi^{\prime})}{\int_{0}^{\pi}i(\theta,\phi)d\theta},\cos \theta = (\cos \Theta -\sin^{2}\phi^{\prime}) / \cos^{2}\phi^{\prime}, \tag{12.91}
$$

where  $\delta (\phi - \phi^{\prime})$  is the Dirac- delta function, and  $\Theta$  is again the scattering angle away from the  $\hat{\mathbf{S}}$ - direction, which is related to polar angle  $\phi^{\prime}$  and azimuthal angle  $\theta$  as given.

The behavior of infinitely long fibers has been investigated by several researchers, notably the group around Tong [31- 36] and by Lee [30, 37- 43] and others [44- 47]. Some of these investigations have concentrated on scattering by single fibers [34, 35, 37], others on effects of dependent scattering [40- 42, 44], but most deal with the effects of various fiber arrangements. For a random arrangement of infinitely long fibers with size distribution  $n(a)$ , extinction and scattering properties can be determined from [37]:

$$
\beta_{\lambda}(m) = \int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{0}^{\pi /2}C_{\mathrm{ext}}(m,x,\phi)\cos \phi d\phi n(a)da, \tag{12.92}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\sigma_{s\lambda}(m) = \int_0^\infty \int_0^{\pi /2}C_{\mathrm{sca}}(m,x,\phi)\cos \phi d\phi n(a)da,}\\ {\Phi_\lambda (m,\Theta) = \frac{1}{\sigma_{s\lambda}}\frac{4\lambda}{\pi^2}\int_0^\infty \int_0^{\pi /2}\frac{i(\theta)}{\sin\theta\cos\phi} d\phi n(a)da,}\\ {\cos \theta = \left(\cos \Theta -\sin^2\phi\right)\left(\cos^2\phi .\right.} \end{array} \tag{12.94}
$$

# 12.9 APPROXIMATE SCATTERING PHASE FUNCTIONS

It is clear from Figs. 12- 3 and 12- 8 that radiative properties of particles may display strong oscillatory behavior with size parameter and, therefore, wavelength, particularly for the case of large, monodisperse, dielectric particles. Even more bothersome is the fact that the scattering phase function may undergo strong angular oscillations at any given single wavelength, again particularly for the case of large, monodisperse, dielectric particles (cf. Figs. 12- 5, 12- 6, 12- 7). Since radiative calculations for media with spectrally varying properties are generally carried out on a spectral basis with subsequent integration over all relevant wavelengths, this fact means that these spectral oscillations are somewhat inconvenient, but they do not make the analysis intractable. Strong angular oscillations in the scattering phase function, on the other hand, will enormously complicate the analysis for any given wavelength. Indeed, most solution methods described in the following chapters cannot accept highly oscillatory phase functions, or else they must be carried to unacceptably high orders or node numbers. It is, therefore, common practice to approximate oscillatory phase functions by simpler expressions with more regular behavior.

It is observed that large particles generally have strong forward- scattering peaks (due to diffraction, cf. Figs. 12- 6 and 12- 7). Indeed, if  $x\rightarrow \infty ,$  half of the total extinction is due to. diffraction into near- forward directions, as described in Section 12.7. Since diffraction was neglected (i.e., treated as transmission) in that section, the phase functions for large particles are in fact simplified. If either geometric optics cannot be used or diffraction effects must be retained for other reasons, then the approximate phase function must accommodate the strong forward- scattering peak. To this purpose many investigators have used the Henyey- Greenstein phase function,

$$
\Phi_{HG}(\Theta) = \frac{1 - g^2}{[1 + g^2 - 2g\cos\Theta]^{3 / 2}}, \tag{12.95}
$$

where  $g$  is the asymmetry factor. Sometimes the Henyey- Greenstein function is written in the form of a Legendre polynomial series, or

$$
\Phi_{HG}(\Theta) = 1 + \sum_{n = 1}^{\infty}(2n + 1)g^{n}P_{n}(\cos \Theta). \tag{12.96}
$$

Thus, this expression is equivalent to equation (12.24) with approximate values for the  $A_{n}$  being related to the asymmetry factor. A representative comparison between Lorenz- Mie and Henyey- Greenstein phase functions is given in Fig. 12- 16 for a dielectric with index of refraction  $m = n = 1.33$  and size parameter  $x = 300$  (water droplets). Both van de Hulst [48] and Hansen [49] have shown that the Henyey- Greenstein formulation gives very accurate results for radiative heat fluxes as long as the particles are nondielectric: Dielectric particles may have a relatively strong backward- scattering peak besides a strong forward- scattering peak. This situation cannot be described by the asymmetry factor alone, and the Henyey- Greenstein formulation must fail. That neglect of backward- scattering peaks can cause considerable error in heat flux calculations has been shown by Modest and Azad [25].

![](images/bf2105756b748aefc822f3bdfc0643421972f4cd798c9a1f8eb0dd0d918efb65.jpg)  
FIGURE 12-16 Comparison of Lorenz-Mie, Henyey-Greenstein, linear-anisotropic, and isotropic phase functions for water droplets  $(m = 1.33, x = 100)$ .

For many calculations the Henyey- Greenstein phase function is still too complicated. As mentioned earlier, in heat transfer applications forward scattering may usually be treated as transmission. This fact has led a number of researchers to the use of so- called Dirac- delta or Delta- Eddington approximations, where the forward- scattering peak is separated from the rest of the scattering phase function by

$$
\Phi (\Theta)\approx 2f\delta (1 - \cos \Theta) + (1 - f)\Phi^{*}(\Theta), \tag{12.97}
$$

where  $\Phi^{*}$  is the new approximate phase function,  $f$  is a forward scattering fraction to be determined, and  $\delta$  is the Dirac- delta function. Substitution of equation (12.97) into equation (10.17) shows that the approximate phase function is properly normalized, that is,

$$
\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}\Phi^{*}(\Theta)d\Omega = 1. \tag{12.98}
$$

Different authors have used different approaches to define  $f$  and  $\Phi^{*}$ . Potter [50] was one of the first to use the following scheme for his work on atmospheric scattering. He truncated the peak by extrapolating the phase function from directions outside the peak into the forward direction; otherwise he left the phase function unchanged. Not surprisingly, his method produced excellent results, but it still leaves the approximate phase function in a rather complex form.

It appears more promising to express the approximate phase function as a truncated Legendre series,

$$
\Phi^{*}(\Theta) = 1 + \sum_{n = 1}^{M}A_{n}^{*}P_{n}(\cos \Theta), \tag{12.99}
$$

where the constant  $M$  is the chosen order of approximation, mostly taken as  $M = 1$  (linear- anisotropic scattering) [25, 51- 53], or  $M = 0$  (isotropic scattering) [52], while higher- order approximations have been carried out by Crosbie and Davidson [52]. There is considerable disagreement among authors about the criteria to be used to determine the forward fraction  $f$  as well as the coefficients  $A_{n}^{*}$ . Both Joseph and coworkers [51] and Crosbie and Davidson [52]

agreed that at least one of the moments of equation (12.97) should be satisfied: Multiplying equation (12.97) by  $P_{m}(\Theta)$  and integrating over all  $\Theta$  results in

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{{\int_{0}^{\pi}\Phi(\Theta)P_{m}(\cos\Theta)d\Theta=\int_{0}^{\pi}2f\delta(1-\cos\Theta)P_{m}(\cos\Theta)d\Theta}}\\ &{}&{+(1-f)\sum_{n=1}^{M}\int_{0}^{\pi}A_{n}^{*}P_{n}(\cos\Theta)P_{m}(\cos\Theta)d\Theta,}\end{array} \tag{12.100}
$$

or, using the fact that Legendre polynomials are orthogonal functions over the interval  $(0, \pi)$  [19],

$$
(1 - f)A_{m}^{*} = A_{m} - (2m + 1)f,m = 1,2,\ldots . \tag{12.101}
$$

If the approximate phase function is to be isotropic, equation (12.101) yields, with  $A_{1}^{*} = 0$ ,

$$
f = \frac{A_1}{3} = g, \tag{12.102}
$$

and

$$
\Phi (\Theta)\approx 2g\delta (1 - \cos \Theta) + (1 - g). \tag{12.103}
$$

Joseph and colleagues [51] developed an approximate linear- anisotropic phase function. They employed equation (12.101) for the first two moments to find  $f$  and  $A_{1}^{*}$ , using an approximate value of  $A_{2} \approx 5g^{2}$  (from the Henyey- Greenstein phase function). However, their approximate phase function may turn out to be negative for some back scattering directions, which is physically impossible. Crosbie and Davidson [52] overcame this difficulty by applying the second moment only conditionally. From the first moment it follows that

$$
A_{1}^{*} = 3\frac{g - f}{1 - f}. \tag{12.104}
$$

Requiring the phase function to be positive for all angles is equivalent to  $|A_{1}^{*}| \leq 1$ , or

$$
\frac{1}{2} (3g - 1)\leq f\leq g. \tag{12.105}
$$

Instead of using the second moment directly, i.e.,  $f = A_{2} / 5$ , they require  $|f - A_{2} / 5|$  to be a minimum without violating equation (12.105). This method can readily be extended to arbitrarily high orders. Their linear- anisotropic and order- 10 phase function approximations are also included in Fig. 12- 16 for water droplets. It should be noted that this method will work only for positive asymmetry factors. In the case of  $g < 0$  the method breaks down and  $f = 0$  should be used. Even then one may find  $A_{1}^{*} < - 1$ , in which case one has to force  $A_{1}^{*} = - 1$  to avoid negative forward scattering. The method will break down completely for strong backward- scattering peaks.

None of the above approximations allows for simultaneous forward- and backward- scattering peaks. Modest and Azad [25] have shown that neglecting the backward- scattering peaks that may appear in dielectrics may cause considerable error in heat flux calculations. Thus, they proposed a double Dirac- delta phase function approximation. However, this model severely complicates the RTE by requiring a  $I(- \hat{\mathbf{s}})$  term (backward intensity).

Example 12.3. Calculate approximate phase functions for monodisperse suspensions of large specular dielectric spheres  $(m = 2)$  and diffusely reflecting spheres, using the Henyey- Greenstein function, and the Crosbie and Davidson model.

# Solution

The Henyey- Greenstein function requires the calculation of the asymmetry factor

$$

$$

FIGURE 12-17 Scattering phase function approximations for Example 12.3.

where  $\mu$  is the cosine of the scattering angle. The Crosbie and Davidson approximation requires the calculation of  $g$  as well as the calculation of

$$
\frac{A_2}{5} = \frac{1}{2}\int_{-1}^{+1}\Phi (\mu)P_2(\mu)d\mu .
$$

Numerical integration of the phase function yields for the specular dielectric spheres  $g = 0.229$  and  $A_{2} / 5 = 0.138$ . Since  $A_{2} / 5< g$  it follows for the Crosbie and Davidson model that  $f = A_{2} / 5 = 0.138$  and, from equation (12.104),  $A_{1}^{*} = 0.315$ . Both approximate phase functions are shown in Fig. 12- 17 together with the exact expression. The Henyey- Greenstein function does not try to remove the forward- scattering peak, but is unable to follow the sharp peak for large  $\mu$ . The Crosbie- Davidson model follows the actual function well, except for the forward peak that has been removed.

The integration for the diffuse- sphere phase function could be carried out analytically but is rather tedious. Numerical integration of the phase function yields for the diffuse spheres  $g = - 0.444$  and  $A_{2} / 5 = 0.062$ . Since  $g< 0$ , the scattering is predominantly backward and the Crosbie and Davidson model cannot be applied. Thus, for this model, we force  $f = 0$  and, from equation (12.104),  $A_{1}^{*} = - 1.333$ ; since this would result in negative values for forward directions we also force  $A_{1}^{*} = - 1$ . It is seen that the Henyey- Greenstein function does not work very well for back scattering, while the Crosbie and Davidson model gives acceptable results.

# 12.10 RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF IRREGULAR PARTICLES AND AGGREGATES

In practical applications particles are rarely, if ever, homogeneous spheres or long cylinders. As noted earlier, averaging over millions of irregularly shaped particles tends to give results very close to those found with the uniform sphere assumption [1]. However, if the average shape of irregular particles does not resemble a sphere or a long fiber, more advanced methods must be employed to study their interaction with electromagnetic waves. Over the years numerous exact and approximate methods have appeared in the literature, recently reviewed by Mishchenko [54] and Wriedt [55], the latter also listing freely available computer codes. An extensive description of general disperse systems has been given by Dombrovsky and Baillis [2]. An in- depth discussion of the treatment of irregular particles is beyond the scope of this text, and

the reader is directed toward these three exhaustive references. We will give here only a very brief account of the perhaps most popular methods, the cluster T- matrix method, the generalized multisphere Mie solution, and the discrete dipole approximation.

# The Cluster T-Matrix Method

The method goes back to 1965 as proposed by Waterman [56], and a detailed description is provided in Mishchenko and coworkers [57]. While the method can be applied to particles of any shape, it is best suited for rotationally symmetric particles, and can be readily applied to multiparticle clusters, such as fractal aggregates. In the T- matrix method the incident, internal, and scattered electromagnetic fields for the individual particles are expanded into vector spherical harmonics. Coefficients of the scattered field are linearly related to those of the incident field by a matrix called the T- (or transition) matrix. Linearity of Maxwell's equations then allows the determination of the scattered field of an agglomerate through superposition. One of the advantages of the T- matrix method is that, once the matrix has been computed, it can be applied to arbitrary incidence angles, i.e., the method provides not only scattering and extinction coefficients, but also directional scattering information, which can be of great importance in laser scattering diagnostics. The method has been gathering considerable popularity and, in particular, has been applied to multisphere clusters, such as soot aggregates [58- 62]. Several T- matrix computer codes are freely available from [63,64].

# The Generalized Multisphere Mie Solution

Like the cluster T- matrix method the generalized multisphere Mie solution (GMM) is also an exact method for scattering from clusters of small particles. In fact, the method shares many features with the T- matrix method, but there are also substantial differences, such as different treatment of far- field interference and in translating field expansions between displaced reference systems [65, 66]. The method was developed by Xu [67, 68], and enjoys increasing popularity for the modeling of scattering from soot aggregates [69- 71]. A GMM computer code may be downloaded from [72].

# The Discrete Dipole Approximation

Another popular method to deal with scattering from aggregates of small particles is the discrete dipole approximation. In the limit of small point masses (i.e., individual atoms) the particles can be thought of as electrical dipoles, which then allows for an exact formulation of the resulting electromagnetic field. To make the problem manageable, a particle or aggregate may be subdivided into a relatively small number of identical elements, each containing many atoms, but small enough to be represented as a dipole oscillator. The vector amplitude of the field scattered by each dipole is determined iteratively, and the total scattered field is obtained as the sum of all the individual dipole fields. The method was first formulated by Purcell and Pennypecker [73]. It appears to be particularly well suited to model aggregates of many identical primary particles, such as soot, and has been employed, for example, by [74, 75].

# 12.11 RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF COMBUSTION PARTICLES

Undoubtedly, some of the most important engineering applications of thermal radiation are in the areas of the combustion of gaseous, liquid (usually in droplet form), or solid (often pulverized) fuels, be it for power production or for propulsion. During combustion thermal radiation will carry energy directly from the combustion products to the burner walls, often at rates higher than for convection. In the case of liquid and solid fuels thermal radiation also plays

an important role in the preheating of the fuel and its ignition. Nearly all flames are visible to the human eye and are, therefore, called luminous (sending out light). Apparently, there is some radiative emission from within the flame at wavelengths where there are no vibration- rotation bands for any combustion gases. This luminous emission is today known to come from tiny char (almost pure carbon) particles, called soot, which are generated during the combustion process. The "dirtier" the flame is (i.e., the higher the soot content), the more luminous it is. A review of the importance of radiative heat transfer in combustion systems has been given by Sarofim and Hottel [76].

All combustion processes are very complicated. Usually there are many intermediate chemical reactions in sequence and/or parallel, intermittent generation of a variety of intermediate species, generation of soot, agglomeration of soot particles, and subsequent partial burning of the soot. Since thermal radiation contributes strongly to the heat transfer mechanism of the combustion, any understanding and modeling of the process must include knowledge of the radiation properties of the combustion gases as well as any particulates that are present. The most important particles are the relatively large coal and fly ash particles formed during the combustion of pulverized coal as well as the very small soot particles. Because of their great importance, these suspensions will be treated in some detail below.

# Pulverized Coal and Fly Ash Dispersions

To calculate the radiative properties of arbitrary size distributions of coal and ash particles, one must have knowledge of their complex index of refraction as a function of wavelength and temperature. Data for carbon and different types of coal indicate that its real part,  $n$ , varies little over the infrared and is relatively insensitive to the type of coal (e.g., anthracite, lignite, bituminous), while the absorptive index,  $k$ , may vary strongly over the spectrum and from coal to coal [77- 79]. The composition of fly ash and, therefore, its optical properties may vary greatly from coal to coal. The few data in the literature [80- 83] report consistent values for the refractive index  $(n \approx 1.5)$  and widely varying values for the absorptive index. Wall and coworkers [82] calculated the absorptive index for a number of Australian coals (based on their ash composition), and found that  $k$  varied between 0.008 and 0.020. Nothing at all appears to be known about the temperature dependence of these optical properties. A summary of representative values for the optical constants of coals and ashes has been reported by Viskanta and colleagues [84] and is reproduced in Table 12.2.

A first attempt to establish formulae for extinction by carbon particles was made by Tien and coworkers [85], who looked at a single index of refraction  $(m = 1.5 - 0.5i)$  for a gamma size distribution of particles [cf. equation (12.34)]. They found a relatively simple (but not very accurate) smooth correlation for the extinction coefficient  $\beta$ . Buckius and Hwang [86] carried out a large number of Lorenz- Mie calculations for a variety of complex indices of refraction (simulating different coals) and a variety of different particle distribution functions

![](images/30522762c47ab02752d1d4ae4b2a1c97e40950bde09f511d9459a6374693a508.jpg)

[gamma distributions and "rectangular" distributions, i.e.,  $n(a) =$  const over a certain range of radii]. They found that, when normalized with the Rayleigh small- particle limit, the absorption coefficient and extinction coefficient as well as the asymmetry factor are virtually independent of the particle size distribution function, and only depend on a mean particle diameter. Employing the range for  $m$  given by Foster and Howarth [77] for different coals, they found a similar insensitivity of the index of refraction, at least in the limits of small and large particles; in the intermediate size range, deviations of up to nearly  $\pm 50\%$  were reported as shown in a sample of their calculations, Fig. 12- 18. The spectral results were also wavelength- integrated to yield Planck- mean and Rosseland- mean absorption and extinction coefficients. Considering a temperature range of  $750\mathrm{K}$  to  $2500\mathrm{K}$  they found that their data could be correlated to within  $30\%$  for the different coals. Based on their numerical data for different types of coals they developed correlations for a number of nondimensional radiation properties. Spectral properties correlated were the absorption and extinction coefficients and the asymmetry factor, with nondimensional  $\kappa$  and  $\beta$  defined by

$$
\kappa^{*}(\lambda ,m) = \kappa (\lambda ,m,N_{T}) / f_{A},\quad \beta^{*}(\lambda ,m) = \beta (\lambda ,m,N_{T}) / f_{A}, \tag{12.106}
$$

where

$$
f_{A} = \int_{0}^{\infty}\pi a^{2}n(a)da \tag{12.107}
$$

is the total projected area of the particles per unit volume. Thus, these nondimensional values are essentially size- averaged absorption and extinction efficiencies [cf. equations (12.39) and (12.40)]. For extremely small particles  $\kappa^{*} \approx \beta^{*}$  may be calculated from Rayleigh scattering theory, equation (12.53), as

$$
\kappa_0^* (\lambda ,m) = \beta_0^* (\lambda ,m) = -\Im \left\{\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2}\right\} \frac{6\pi f_v}{\lambda f_A} = -4\bar{x}\Im \left\{\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2}\right\} , \tag{12.108}
$$

where  $\bar{x}$  is a mean size parameter based on a mean particle radius defined by

$$
\bar{r} = \frac{3f_v}{4f_A} = \frac{\int_0^\infty a^3n(a)da}{\int_0^\infty a^2n(a)da}. \tag{12.109}
$$

Since  $\beta_0^*$  is linear in  $\bar{x}$  it may also be regarded as a weighted (by a function of  $m$ ) size parameter. The asymmetry factor for Rayleigh scattering is zero (because of its symmetric phase function) and  $g_0$  for the small particle limit must be found from a higher- order expansion given by [86], which may be simplified to

$$
g_{0}(\lambda ,m) = \frac{1}{15}\Re \left\{\frac{(m^{2} + 2)(m^{2} + 3)}{2m^{2} + 3}\right\} \left(\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\right)^{2}\frac{\int_{0}^{\infty}a^{6}n(a)da}{\int_{0}^{\infty}a^{6}n(a)da}. \tag{12.110}
$$

In a similar fashion, they defined nondimensional Planck- mean and Rosseland- mean absorption and extinction coefficients, all normalized by  $f_{A}$ . All correlations obey the same basic formula,

$$
\frac{1}{y^z} = \frac{1}{y_0^z} +\frac{1}{y_\infty^z}, \tag{12.111}
$$

where  $y$  stands for one of the above nondimensional properties,  $y_0$  is that property for small average particle sizes, and  $y_\infty$  the one for large average particle sizes. The correlation parameters  $y_0$ ,  $y_\infty$ , and  $z$  for the various properties are summarized in Table 12.3, and results of this correlation are included in Fig. 12- 18. A somewhat simpler set of formulae to calculate the radiative properties in pulverized- coal reactors has been given by Kim and Lior [88].

The results of Buckius and Hwang were essentially corroborated by Viskanta and coworkers [84]. They too found that variations with particle distribution functions are relatively minor, and that the different indices of refraction made a difference only for midsized particles. However, they felt that these differences were too large to use a single correlation and presented individual graphs for different coals. Table 12.3 indicates that—according to Buckius and Hwang [86]—Planck- mean and Rosseland- mean coefficients do not depend on the optical properties of the coal and are very close to one another. Again, this observation was corroborated by Viskanta and coworkers [84] for carbon, anthracite and bituminous coal, as well as for lignite at high temperature (above 1000 K). For fly ash and for lower temperature lignite mean absorption coefficients were considerably lower due to the significantly lower absorptive indices of these materials. Thus, Table 12.3 should be regarded as a relatively crude approximation, which should be replaced when more accurate data for different coals and ashes become available (optical properties varying with wavelength and temperature, particle size distributions).

Mengüç and Viskanta [87] applied the approximate theory of equations (12.59) to two very different particle size distributions and several different complex indices of refraction (simulating carbon particles, several coals, and fly ash). They found the approximate solutions to agree very well with full Lorenz- Mie calculations, even for carbon particles [which, with  $m = 2.20 - 1.12i$ , significantly violate the limitations on equations (12.59)]. Like Buckius and Hwang [86] they noticed that the particle size distribution has only a very small effect on radiative properties. For comparison, results from equation (12.59) for particles of uniform size are also included in Fig. 12- 18, showing good agreement with Buckius and Hwang's correlation for large particle sizes. Equations (12.59) predict the index of refraction effects more accurately but must fail for small size parameters. Liu and Swithenbank [89] used the same simplified theory, together with the comprehensive experimental data of Goodwin [83], to predict radiative properties of fly ash dispersions. They found that wavelength dependence of the complex index of refraction cannot be ignored: while  $n$  remains relatively constant, the absorptive index  $k$  of fly ash varies by orders of magnitude across the spectrum, causing large changes in radiative properties. Im and Ahluwalia [90], also using Goodwin's [83] data, have given a correlation of the complex index of refraction for fly ash, as a function of wavelength and mineral composition. Manickavasagam and Mengüç [91] gave direct correlations for the absorption coefficient of two coals (as a function of wavelength), again finding that particle size distributions did not change  $\kappa$  appreciably. A slightly different approach was taken by Caldas and Semão [92], who used four curve fits to the Lorenz- Mie results for  $Q_{\mathrm{ext}}$  and  $Q_{\mathrm{sca}}$ , covering different ranges of effective particle sizes. They applied this method to several distributions typical of fly ash and carbon particles. Small Fortran routines for the models of Buckius and Hwang and of Mengüç and Viskanta are included in Appendix F.

# Radiative Properties of Soot

Soot particles are produced in fuel- rich flames, or fuel- rich parts of flames, as a result of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbon fuels. As shown by electron microscopy, soot particles are generally small and spherical, ranging in size between approximately  $50\mathrm{\AA}$  and  $800\mathrm{\AA}$  (5nm to  $80\mathrm{nm}$ ), and up to about  $3000\mathrm{\AA}$  in extreme cases [93,94]. While mostly spherical in shape, soot particles may also appear in agglomerated chunks and even as long agglomerated filaments. It has been determined experimentally in typical diffusion flames of hydrocarbon fuels that the volume percentage of soot generally lies in the range between  $10^{- 4}\%$  to  $10^{- 6}\%$  [76,95,96].

Since soot particles are very small, they are generally at the same temperature as the flame and, therefore, strongly emit thermal radiation in a continuous spectrum over the infrared region. Experiments have shown that soot emission often is considerably stronger than the emission from the combustion gases. In order to predict the radiative properties of a soot cloud, it is necessary to determine the amount, shape, and distribution of soot particles, as well as their optical properties, which depend on chemical composition and particle porosity. It is known today that key steps in soot formation and destruction (oxidation) are [97- 105]: formation of gas- phase precursors (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons- PAHs) in fuel- rich regions; soot particle inception ( $\sim 1\mathrm{nm}$  particle size); particle surface growth involving acetylene  $(\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_2)$  and/or PAHs; particle coagulation/agglomeration (up to tens of  $\mu \mathrm{m}$  particle size); and oxidation in oxygen- rich regions. High- level soot models often employ concentration moments of the soot distribution function [106- 108]: this "method- of- moments" has the advantage that it allows the distribution of soot particles to be computed using essentially the same approach that is used for gas- phase chemical species.

Early work on soot radiation properties concentrated on predicting the absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{\lambda}$  for a given flame as a function of wavelength. For all but the largest soot particles the size parameter  $x = 2\pi a / \lambda$  is very small for all but the shortest wavelengths in the infrared, so one may expect that Rayleigh's theory for small particles will, at least approximately, hold. This condition would, according to equation (12.53), lead to negligible scattering and an absorption

FIGURE 12-19 Dispersion exponent  $a$  of soot deposits vs. hydrogen-to-carbon ratio: 1, pure carbon (arc evaporated); 2, acetylene/oxygen flame; 3, ethylene/oxygen flame; 4, 5, 6, ethylene/air flames [110].

coefficient of

$$
\kappa_{\lambda} = \beta_{\lambda} = -\Im \left\{\frac{m^{2} - 1}{m^{2} + 2}\right\} \frac{6\pi f_{v}}{\lambda} = \frac{36\pi nk}{(n^{2} - k^{2} + 2)^{2} + 4n^{2}k^{2}}\frac{f_{v}}{\lambda}. \tag{12.112}
$$

In the soot literature it is common to employ a (soot) "refractive index function,"

$$
E(m) = -\Im \left\{\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2}\right\} = \frac{6nk}{(n^2 - k^2 + 2)^2 + 4n^2k^2} \tag{12.113}
$$

and the absorption coefficient reduces to

$$
\kappa_{\lambda} = \beta_{\lambda} = 6\pi E(m)\frac{f_v}{\lambda}. \tag{12.114}
$$

Experiments have confirmed that scattering may indeed be neglected [109]. The form of equation (12.114) would lead one to expect that the absorption coefficient should vary with wavelength as  $1 / \lambda$ . However, this assumption is only approximately correct, since the complex index of refraction  $m$  (and, in particular, the absorptive index  $k$ ) can vary significantly across the spectrum. It is customary to write

$$
\kappa_{\lambda} = \frac{Cf_v}{\lambda^a}, \tag{12.115}
$$

where  $C$  and  $a$  are empirical constants. Many different values for the dispersion exponent  $a$  have been measured by investigators for many different flame conditions, ranging from as low as 0.7 to as high as 2.2. Earlier theories explained this deviation from Rayleigh theory to be a consequence of particle size. While it is true that Lorenz- Mie theory predicts a growing value for  $a$  for increasing particle size, it is easy to show that this alone cannot explain the large values for the dispersion exponent in some flames. Rather, this increase in  $a$  must be due to spectral variations of the effective complex index of refraction, resulting from the chemical composition and the porosity of the soot particles. Millikan [110,111] investigated the dependence between dispersion exponent and chemical composition. While for many years soot was assumed to be amorphous carbon, he found the particles contained considerable amounts of hydrogen (up to 40 atom- %), and he determined that  $a$  was approximately directly proportional to the hydrogen- carbon ratio of the soot material as shown in Fig. 12- 19. He further showed that the radiative properties of the soot were the same for in situ flame measurements as for soot collected from the flame, suggesting that the optical properties are fairly independent of temperature. Unfortunately, his experimental setup did not allow for the determination of the constant  $C$  in equation (12.115), so that quantitative evaluation of the extinction coefficient is not possible.

The optical properties of soot material, i.e., the complex index of refraction  $m$ , have received a very considerable amount of attention during the last forty years, using different forms of carbon and various experimental methods. Foster and Howarth [77] were the first to report experimental measurements for the complex index of refraction of hydrocarbon soot, based on various carbon black powders. This work was followed shortly thereafter with measurements by Dalzell and Sarofim [112] on soot collected on cooled brass plates from laminar diffusion flames burning either acetylene or propane. In both cases pellets with very smooth, quasispecular surfaces were formed by compressing small soot samples between optically flat surfaces with pressures up to 2760 bar. The index of refraction was then deduced from reflectance measurements employing Fresnel's relations for specular reflectors. They found the optical properties of the two different soots to be fairly similar, with values for acetylene soot somewhat higher than for propane soot, apparently because of the higher  $\mathrm{H} / \mathrm{C}$  ratio in propane soot. Comparing their results with values reported by Stull and Plass [113] (based on amorphous carbon) and by Howarth, Foster, and Thring [114] (based on pyrographite) they note that optical properties of amorphous or graphitic carbon are not equal to those of soot, primarily because of the different  $\mathrm{H} / \mathrm{C}$  ratios.

The data of Dalzell and Sarofim [112] have been employed in many subsequent studies (and continue to be used today). For example, Hubbard and Tien [115] used them to evaluate Planck- mean and Rosseland- mean absorption coefficients for soot clouds and soot- gas mixtures. However, the accuracy of Dalzell and Sarofim's data has been questioned by a number of researchers. All ex situ measurements suffer from the fact that during the analysis the soot is not in the same state as in the flame. The soot particles are at a different temperature, and they may have different morphologies because of agglomeration during the sampling process. The severest criticism concerns the pellet- reflection technique. Medalia and Richards [116], Graham [117], and Janzen [118] have pointed out that the pellets must contain a considerable amount of void (33% even after compression to 2760 bar, according to Medalia and Richards [116]), since the sample is made by compressing a powder. This technique leads to two serious sources for errors: (i) Since the pellets are actually a two- phase dispersion of soot and air, the inferred index of refraction is the one of the dispersion and not the one of the soot particles themselves, and (ii) at least at short wavelengths the pellet cannot be assumed to be optically smooth and Fresnel's relations become invalid.

These problems prompted Lee and Tien [119] to obtain soot optical properties from in situ flame transmission data together with application of the dispersion theory [18,120] (i.e., the theory that predicts the wavenumber dependence of the optical constants  $n$  and  $k$  by relating them to bound- and free- electron densities). Their results for polystyrene and Plexiglas flame soot, based on data by Buckius and Tien [121] and Bard and Pagni [122], are shown in Fig. 12- 20 together with the data of Stull and Plass [113], Howarth and coworkers [114], and the propane soot results of Dalzell and Sarofim [112] and Chang and Charalampopoulos [123]. Lee and Tien's data agree fairly well with those of Dalzell and Sarofim, except for the visible where the pellet- reflection technique is particularly suspect. In contrast to Dalzell and Sarofim as well as Millikan [110, 111], Tien and Lee noted that the optical properties varied little from flame to flame despite their different fuel (not necessarily soot)  $\mathrm{H} / \mathrm{C}$  ratios. Conceivably the soot of their different flames had similar  $\mathrm{H} / \mathrm{C}$  ratios. They also applied the dispersion theory to determine the temperature dependence of the optical properties, observing that  $m = n - ik$  is very insensitive to temperature changes at high temperature levels. This would imply negligible effect of spatial temperature variation on soot properties, as is commonly assumed. It should be noted that, like the pellet- reflection technique, the spectral transmission technique has its own set of difficulties: For its data reduction, a scattering theory and a theory describing the spectral variation of the refractive index (the dispersion theory) must be used. Usually the Lorenz- Mie scattering theory based on monodisperse spherical soot particles is employed. Thus, only when the particles are spherical with a single diameter can these results be used with confidence. The more recent data of Chang and Charalampopoulos show similar values for the refractive index, but somewhat

![](images/c2cc4de2984603e1281ad02837f3844310694fc2d23b6c6eb0eac8545cb25b05.jpg)

lower absorptive indices. Their data have been confirmed in even more recent studies covering diverse flame conditions [124]. Chang and Charalampopoulos [123] also provided a polynomial expression, valid for the wavelength range

$$

In another investigation Felske and coworkers [125] returned to the pellet- reflection technique, arguing that—for a carefully prepared pellet—the data in the infrared do obey Fresnel's relations. They also measured the void fraction over the first few layers of particles (where all absorption occurs) and found that the proportion of voids in these layers is significantly lower (18%) than in the bulk of the material (33%). For their data evaluation they first determined the applicability of Fresnel's relations by measuring the specularity index defined as

$$
s = \rho_{\perp}^{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)\bigg / \rho_{\parallel}\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right), \tag{12.117}
$$

where  $\rho_{\perp}$  and  $\rho_{\parallel}$  are the perpendicular and parallel polarized components of the pellet reflectance, respectively. For a surface obeying Fresnel's relations  $s = 1$  always, regardless of the complex index of refraction of the material [cf. equations (3.52) and (3.53)]. They determined that their surfaces could be considered specular reflectors for wavelengths  $\lambda \geq 2.0 \mu \mathrm{m}$ . They then proceeded to correct their data for the measured void fraction using a number of different models. Their data for the refractive index of propane soot are also included in Fig. 12- 20. Their data, even after correction for voidage (which raises the value for  $n$  by approximately 0.3, and for  $k$  by approximately 0.15), differ significantly from those of other investigations and depend only weakly on wavelength.

It is well known today that in most flames soot particles agglomerate into large chunks or long chains, making the use of the spherical- particle assumption very questionable. A

number of textbooks have considered scattering by nonspherical particles [3, 16, 18], and a short introduction to methods for nonspherical particles and agglomerates was provided in Section 12.10. Approximating chunks of soot as prolate spheroids, Jones [126] found their absorption behavior to be considerably different from that of spheres of identical volumes. Lee and Tien [127] investigated the extreme case of long chains approximated by infinite cylinders. They found that the extinction coefficient for spheres drops off in the infrared much faster than the one for cylinders of the same radius. However, the wavelength- integrated extinction coefficient is rather insensitive to particle shape at elevated temperatures, say  $T > 1000\mathrm{K}$  (i.e., at flame temperatures where soot emission may be important) [127]. Similar results were found by Mackowski and coworkers [128], who looked at infinite soot cylinders also using Lee and Tien's optical properties. Investigating the behavior of polydisperse cylindrical soot particles, they found the behavior to be similar to that observed by Buckius and Hwang [86] for polydisperse coal particles. While they generated correlations for absorption and extinction coefficients according to equation (12.111), unfortunately their correlation is rather cumbersome to use since different sets of parameters apply to each of a large number of wavelengths.

In more modern measurements Dobbins and Megaridis [129] built a thermophoretic probe that made it possible to sample soot aggregates from flames for electron microscope studies. They showed that near the start of soot formation small aggregates form (on the order of  $10\mathrm{nm}$ ), while clusters up to  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$  in length can be found in turbulent flames, i.e., sizes clearly too large for the Rayleigh theory to hold. Experiments have further shown that soot aggregates resemble mass fractals, and the number of soot particles in an aggregate is given by<sup>3</sup>

$$
N = k_{f}(R_{g} / a)^{D_{f}}, \tag{12.118}
$$

where  $a$  is the radius of the individual soot particles,  $R_{g}$  is the radius of gyration, and  $D_{f}$  and  $k_{f}$  are mass fractal dimension and fractal prefactor, respectively [130,131]. Various soot aggregates of different size and shape have been found to have universal morphology with  $1.6 < D_{f} < 1.9$  and  $2.0 < k_{f} < 2.6$ , almost independent of fuel or position within a flame [132- 135]. On the other hand, fractal clusters generated theoretically by diffusion limited cluster aggregation (DLCA) tend to lead to smaller fractal prefactors of around 1.2 [136], a discrepancy that remains unresolved. For monodisperse particles the radius of gyration is found from

$$
R_{g}^{2} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}r_{i}^{2}, \tag{12.119}
$$

where  $r_{i}$  is the distance from the center of each particle to the center of gravity of the soot aggregate.

Accordingly, more recent theoretical studies have modeled agglomerated soot as long chains of spherical particles [133, 137- 155]. Three different fundamental approaches have been pursued, most using Jones' formulation [156, 157], which in turn is based on Saxon's integral equation [158]. In this method primary soot particles are assumed to obey Rayleigh scattering and the electric field inside them is taken as uniform, while the field outside the particles is determined from the integral representation of Maxwell's equations [137- 142]. In the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) of Purcell and Pennypecker [73] the soot aggregate is modeled as an array of  $N$  polarizable elements ("dipoles") in vacuum, leading to a set of linear algebraic equations [143- 146]. In the model of Iskander and coworkers [159], known as the I- C- P model, the aggregate is divided into cubical or spherical cells with uniform electromagnetic fields. A control volume analysis converts the governing equations to a set of linear algebraic ones [147- 149]. Results from these aggregate models show that approximating agglomerated soot as infinitely long cylinders [127, 128] leads to significant errors. In recent years a number

of numerically exact (and computer intensive) simulations of fractal soot aggregates have also been carried out, using the T- matrix and generalized multisphere Mie (GMM) solutions, as briefly described in Section 12.10 [59, 61, 69- 71, 160, 161].

Good reviews of the different methods to calculate scattering properties of agglomerated soot have been given by Koylui and Faeth [151], Manickavasagam and Menguc [154], and by Sorensen [162], also assessing a number of more approximate theories, such as regular Rayleigh scattering (treating particles as independent), equivalent- sphere Mie scattering (replacing the agglomerate by a single sphere of equal volume), and Rayleigh- Debye- Gans (R- D- G) scattering (valid for  $|m - 1|\ll 1$ ) for both assumed shapes (such as straight chains) as well as fractal aggregates. While Rayleigh scattering always underpredicts scattering, equivalent- sphere Mie scattering can give acceptable results under certain conditions, in particular for small aggregates, but must also be regarded as unreliable, in general. The R- D- G scattering theory tends to give relatively good results, especially if fractal aggregates are considered (i.e., conforming to experimental observations). However, the R- D- G scattering theory assumes a complex index of refraction near unity, which is clearly not very accurate for soot, especially at larger wavelengths (see Fig. 12- 20). Koylui and Faeth [163] pointed out and corrected inconsistencies in the fractal R- D- G model of Dobbins and Megaridis [150], as reported in [151], and revised results have been given by Farias and coworkers [152]. Another variation of the R- D- G approach has been reported by Sorensen and Roberts [136], using a slightly different form factor. Zhao and Ma [61] have compared the two R- D- G models and assessed their accuracy, finding both models to perform about equally well.

Results from equivalent- sphere Mie calculations and R- D- G calculations are compared with approximate I- C- P calculations of Nelson [147] (assuming a mean scalar field) in Fig. 12- 21 [151]. Figure 12- 21a shows that the absorption cross- section of a soot aggregate,  $C_{\mathrm{abs}}^a$ , differs by only a few percent from that of  $N$  independent soot particles. This result is also obtained by the R- D- G theory (for assumed or fractal aggregates) since it neglects agglomeration effects on absorption, while the equivalent sphere calculations become totally unreliable for  $N > 10$ . Mackowski [164] used the electrostatic approximation (ESA) to calculate  $C_{\mathrm{abs}}^a$  for fractal aggregates with various indices of refraction. He found that agglomeration effects on the absorption coefficient are well correlated by

$$
\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{abs}}^a}{NC_{\mathrm{abs}}^p}\right) = \frac{3}{2N + 1} +\frac{2(N - 1)}{2N + 1}\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{abs}}^a}{NC_{\mathrm{abs}}^p}\right)_\infty , \tag{12.120}
$$

with the limiting value for  $N \to \infty$  depending on the refractive index function  $E(m)$ . For typical soot optical constants  $(C_{\mathrm{abs}}^a /NC_{\mathrm{sca}}^p)_\infty$  is relatively small  $(= 1.06$  for  $m = 1.6 - 0.6i)$ , but can be substantial for larger  $m$ . These results were qualitatively confirmed by Liu and Smallwood [69, 70], who used the exact GMM formulation. However, they noted that  $C_{\mathrm{abs}}^p$  also depends on primary particle size, and that equation (12.120) becomes inaccurate for large soot particles  $(x > 0.1)$ .

Figure 12- 21b indicates that the relative scattering cross- section,  $C_{\mathrm{sca}}^a /NC_{\mathrm{sca}}^p$ , strongly increases with particle number—first linearly (for small aggregates with negligible multiple scattering and self- interaction), then tending toward a saturation value for large  $N$ . Again, the equivalent sphere predictions become unreliable for  $N > 10$  or so, while the R- D- G model gives plausible results, especially if the same fractal distribution as that of Nelson is used. The fractal R- D- G results in Fig. 12- 21b reflect the corrections made by Köylü and colleagues [152, 163], which leads to a large- agglomerate limit for the scattering cross- section of

$$
\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{sca}}^a}{NC_{\mathrm{sca}}^p}\right)_\infty = \frac{k_f}{(2x)^{D_f}}\left[\frac{3}{2 - D_f} -\frac{12}{(6 - D_f)(4 - D_f)}\right], \tag{12.121}
$$

while for intermediate values of  $N$  the data of Farias and coworkers [152] are accurately correlated by a simple power law,

$$
\frac{C_{\mathrm{sca}}^a}{NC_{\mathrm{sca}}^p} = \left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{sca}}^a}{NC_{\mathrm{sca}}^p}\right)_\infty^{1 - N^{-1 / 4}}. \tag{12.122}
$$

Agreement between R- D- G results and Nelson's I- C- P model is good except for large clusters, for which Nelson's results have been shown to underpredict the relative scattering cross- section by the more complete I- C- P calculations of Farias and coworkers [152]. Comparison with exact GMM calculations of Liu and Smallwood [70] showed good agreement with equation (12.122) for all  $N$ . Recent measurements of Chakrabarty [135] on ethene soot, determining absorption and scattering coefficients via nephelometry and photoacoustic spectroscopy, produced a fractal prefactor of  $k_{f} = 2.6$ , and a mass fractal dimension of  $D_{f} = 1.7$ . Comparison with R- D- G theory showed the results to be always within  $10\%$ . While perhaps not yet established as a completely reliable tool, it is generally agreed today that the fractal R- D- G theory provides simple and reliable estimates of the radiative properties of agglomerated soot.

All of the above models assume soot aggregates to consist of single size and spherical primary particles. Extensive measurements by Dobbins and Megaridis [129] and by Köylü and colleagues [132, 165] have shown that soot primary particles generally vary in size between 15 and  $50\mathrm{nm}$ , depending on fuel and on flame location, but that their local size distribution has indeed a very small standard deviation (almost uniform). The number of particles comprising an aggregate,  $N$ , on the other hand, shows strong local and global variations, following a log- normal distribution with geometric standard deviations ranging from 2 to 3.5.

For a simplified heat transfer analysis it is generally desirable to use suitably defined mean absorption and extinction coefficients such as the Planck- mean and Rosseland- mean. If the soot particles are very small so that the Rayleigh theory applies for all particles and relevant wavelengths, then the extinction coefficient is described by equation (12.114). By choosing appropriate spectral average values for the refractive index  $n$  and absorptive index  $k$  one may approximate the extinction coefficient by

$$
\kappa_{\lambda} = \beta_{\lambda} = C_{0}\frac{f_{v}}{\lambda},\quad C_{0} = 6\pi E(m_{\mathrm{avg}}) = \frac{36\pi nk}{(n^{2} - k^{2} + 2)^{2} + 4n^{2}k^{2}}, \tag{12.123}
$$

where  $C_0$  is now a constant depending only on the soot index of refraction. With this simple  $1 / \lambda$  wavelength dependence, Planck- mean and Rosseland- mean extinction coefficients are readily calculated as

$$
\kappa_{P} = \beta_{P} = 3.83f_{v}C_{0}T / C_{2},\kappa_{R} = \beta_{R} = 3.60f_{v}C_{0}T / C_{2}, \tag{12.124}
$$

where  $C_2 = 1.4388\mathrm{cmK}$  is the second Planck function constant. It is interesting to note that the Planck- mean coefficient (appropriate for optically thin situations) differs by only  $6\%$  from the Rosseland- mean (appropriate for optically thick situations). Thus, Felske and Tien [166] have suggested using an average value of

$$
\kappa_{m} = \beta_{m} = 3.72f_{v}C_{0}T / C_{2} \tag{12.125}
$$

for all optical regimes. It is important to keep in mind that the above formulae apply only to very small soot particles, and that the extinction coefficient will increase for aggregates, as indicated in Fig. 12- 21, or if primary particle sizes are encountered that exceed Rayleigh scattering limits.

Example 12.4. Propane is burned with air under fuel- rich conditions, resulting in a volume fraction of soot of  $f_{v} = 10^{- 5}$ . Determine the extinction coefficient for very small particles at a wavelength of  $3\mu \mathrm{m}$  using the refractive index data of (i) Lee and Tien, (ii) Stull and Plass, (iii) Dalzell and Sarofim, (iv) Chang and Charalampopoulos, and (v) Felske and coworkers. If the soot consisted of long fractal aggregates with 100 soot particles each  $(a = 50\mathrm{nm})$ , how would the extinction coefficient change?

# Solution

To determine the extinction coefficient for small spherical soot particles we use equation (12.112) together with optical property data from Fig. 12- 20:

Lee and Tien:  $n = 2.21,\quad k = 1.23,\qquad \kappa_{\lambda} = 0.1754\mathrm{cm}^{- 1};$  Stull and Plass:  $n = 2.63,k = 1.95,$ $\kappa_{\lambda} = 0.1472\mathrm{cm}^{- 1};$  Dalzell and Sarofim:  $n = 2.19,k = 1.30,$ $\kappa_{\lambda} = 0.1835\mathrm{cm}^{- 1};$  Chang and Charalampopoulos  $n = 1.89,\quad k = 0.92,$ $\kappa_{\lambda} = 0.1904\mathrm{cm}^{- 1};$  Felske and coworkers:  $n = 2.31,k = 0.71,$ $\kappa_{\lambda} = 0.1077\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$

Thus, the values found from the data of Lee and Tien, Dalzell and Sarofim, and Chang and Charalampopoulos are fairly consistent, while the absorptive index based on Stull and Plass' data is considerably higher, probably because amorphous carbon simply does not represent soot well. The absorptive index based on the data of Felske and coworkers is by far the lowest. The extinction coefficient for soot aggregates can be estimated from equation (12.122). Reworking Example 12.1 (i.e., using Lee and Tien's data, but with ten times the volume fraction and twice the particle size), we find  $x = 2\pi \times 0.05 / 3 = 0.1048$ ,  $Q_{\mathrm{abs}}^p = 1.17\times 10^{- 1}$ , and  $Q_{\mathrm{sca}}^p = 1.94\times 10^{- 4}$ . For an aggregate, the absorption coefficient remains relatively unchanged. If we employ equation (12.120) with  $(C_{\mathrm{abs}}^a /NC_{\mathrm{sca}}^p)_\infty \simeq 1.06$ , we obtain

$$
\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{sca}}^a}{NC_{\mathrm{sca}}^p}\right) = \frac{3}{201} +\frac{2\times 99}{201}\times 1.06\simeq 1.06,
$$

i.e., the absorption coefficient increases by about  $6\%$ , or

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\kappa_{\lambda} = Q_{\mathrm{abs}}^{a}\pi a^{2}(N_{T} / N) = \left(C_{\mathrm{abs}}^{a} / NC_{\mathrm{abs}}^{p}\right)Q_{\mathrm{abs}}^{p}\pi a^{2}N_{T} = \left(C_{\mathrm{abs}}^{a} / NC_{\mathrm{abs}}^{p}\right)Q_{\mathrm{abs}}^{p}\frac{3f_{v}}{4a}}\\ {= 1.06\times 0.117\times \frac{3\times 10^{-5}}{4\times 5\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{cm}}\simeq 0.1860\mathrm{cm}^{-1}.} \end{array}
$$

On the other hand, the scattering coefficient becomes (using the fractal parameters of Fig. 12- 21)

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\sigma_{s,\lambda} = Q_{\mathrm{sca}}^a\pi a^2 (N_T / N) = \left(C_{\mathrm{sca}}^a /NC_{\mathrm{sca}}^p\right)Q_{\mathrm{sca}}^p\frac{3f_v}{4a}}\\ {\left(\frac{C_{\mathrm{sca}}^a}{NC_{\mathrm{sca}}^p}\right)_\infty = \frac{1.9}{(2\times 0.1048)^{1.8}}\left[\frac{3}{0.2} -\frac{12}{4.2\times 2.2}\right] = 433.5}\\ {\frac{C_{\mathrm{sca}}^a}{NC_{\mathrm{sca}}^p} = 433.5^{1 - 100^{-1 / 4}} = 63.5} \end{array}
$$

and

$$
\sigma_{s,\lambda}\simeq 63.5\times 1.94\times 10^{-4}\times \frac{3\times 10^{-5}}{4\times 5\times 10^{-6}\mathrm{cm}}\simeq 1.85\times 10^{-2}\mathrm{cm}^{-1}.
$$

Adding together we find  $\beta_{\lambda} = \kappa_{\lambda} + \sigma_{s,\lambda} = 0.1860 + .0185 = 0.2045\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , i.e., while scattering from aggregates is 63 times larger than that from individual particles, and may not be negligible (depending on the physical size of the soot cloud), its impact on the extinction coefficient is fairly small.

# 12.12 EXPERIMENTAL DETERMINATION OF RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF PARTICLES

Experimental measurements of radiative properties of particles and clouds of particles are useful to verify the Lorenz- Mie theory, to ascertain the applicability of the Lorenz- Mie theory (for nonspherical particles, nonisotropic particles, closely spaced particles, etc.), or simply to determine the radiative properties of particles for which no theory exists. A comprehensive review of such experiments up to 1991 has been given by Agarwal and Menguc [167]. Properties that can be measured are extinction coefficient, absorption coefficient, and scattered intensity. The easiest property to measure is the extinction coefficient. In principle, a standard spectrometer can be used for this measurement. The results, however, may be unreliable unless the detector is modified to eliminate forward- scattered light, which may account for the majority of total extinction [18] (in particular for large particle sizes, cf. Figs. 12- 6 and 12- 7). A schematic of such an apparatus is shown in Fig. 12- 22. Light from a point source is collimated by a lens, transmitted through the sample cell (with its suspension of particles), and then focused onto a detector by a second lens. In order to reject forward- scattered light, the detector is covered by a guard plate with a small pinhole located at the focal point of the second lens. The diameter of the pinhole must be carefully optimized: If the hole is too small then the signal from the transmitted light may become too weak, while a hole too large will admit an unacceptable amount of forward- scattered energy to the detector. Normally the light beam is chopped by a rotating blade since most detectors only respond to changes in irradiation.

To distinguish between absorption and scattering, either the absorption coefficient or total scattering must be measured independently. To measure scattering over all (forward and backward) directions is very difficult, requiring a spectrometer capable of collecting radiation going into all directions (usually accomplished with an integrating sphere technique described in Chapter 3; cf., for example, Bryant et al. [168]). Absorption can also be detected fairly easily with a method usually referred to as photoacoustic [18]. Particles irradiated by a chopped beam are heated periodically, causing periodic changes in the particle temperature, which in turn cause slight pressure oscillations that may be detected by a sensitive microphone. These signals are then amplified by a lock- in amplifier synchronized with the light chopper. Since only absorbed light causes a temperature change in the particles, the acoustic signal must be proportional to the absorption coefficient of the suspension. Details may be found in the papers by Roessler and Faxvog [169] and Faxvog and Roessler [170], who measured the absorption coefficients of acetylene smoke and diesel emissions using this method. An ingenious way to separate transmitted and scattered radiation in the visible has been developed by Hard and Nilsson [171], who utilized the Doppler effect that occurs when an electromagnetic wave is scattered by a moving particle.

Angular scattering measurements are carried out with a scattering photometer (sometimes

called a nephelometer). We distinguish between measurements with single scattering (i.e., the cell contains a dilute particle mixture that is optically thin,  $\sigma_{s}L\ll 1$ , so that every light beam is scattered at most once before exiting the particle layer) and multiple scattering, between monodisperse suspensions (i.e., all particles are exactly the same size) and polydisperse suspensions (i.e., the particle sizes obey a certain distribution function), between near- forward scattering (to measure the strong forward- scattering peak, but separating it from transmission) and scattering into all directions. Angular light scattering measurements are sometimes classified as either absolute or relative. In an absolute measurement the ratio between intercepted and scattered radiation,  $\delta I_{s}(\Theta) / I_{i}$ , is measured directly, while in a relative measurement the scattered intensity is related to intensity scattered into a reference direction,  $\delta I_{s}(\Theta) / \delta I_{s}(\Theta_{\mathrm{ref}})$ . Thus neither measurement is truly "absolute"; in both cases a relative (i.e., nondimensional) intensity is recorded [18]. Since relative measurements are considerably easier to make, this method is employed by most experimentalists.

Single scattering experiments have been carried out primarily to verify the Lorenz- Mie theory, or to assess the accuracy of a device to be used for other scattering measurements. Hottel and coworkers [172] described such an experiment, in which they measured the nondimensional polarized intensities given by equation (12.10) for monodisperse polystyrene latex spheres (it appears that polystyrene spheres are favored by most experimenters, since it is relatively easy to manufacture spheres of constant diameter and of known index of refraction in the visible,  $m = 1.60$ , i.e., the spheres scatter but do not absorb). Their equipment consisted of a mercury arc and optics to produce an unpolarized near- parallel beam, a polarizer, a test cell manufactured from parallel microscope slides, and optics to confine the received beam to a small divergence angle. Their results for single scattering of small  $(2a = 0.106\mu \mathrm{m})$  spheres are shown in Fig. 12- 23. It is seen that the agreement between experiment and Lorenz- Mie theory is excellent. Hottel and coworkers attribute the small discrepancies primarily to the unavoidable spread in particle sizes. A more modern device to measure the scattering phase function for (almost) single scattering, as well as extinction and scattering coefficients, has been reported by Menart and colleagues [173]. Their apparatus employed a globar light source and an open gas- particle column, both mounted on a rotatable table, together with collection optics and a highly sensitive dual element (InSb- HgCdTe) detector. Measurements taken for soda- lime glass beads

and aluminum oxide particles in the wavelength range between 2.5 and  $11\mu \mathrm{m}$  showed good agreement with Lorenz- Mie theory.

Multiple scattering experiments were reported by Woodward [174,175], also on polystyrene spheres, using dispersions with narrow size distribution. Woodward found good agreement between his data and the multiple- scattering theory of Hartel [176], a somewhat dated approximate solution of the equation of transfer for a purely scattering medium. However, as Smart and coworkers [177] pointed out, Woodward did not correct for the reflection of the emergent beam at the water- glass- air interfaces of the test cell, nor did he account for the change in scattering path length for larger angles. To compensate for these errors, Smart and coworkers [177] devised an apparatus whose schematic is shown in Fig. 12- 24. Employing a standard Brice- Phoenix spectrometer, they placed the simple parallel- microscope slide test section inside a special cell filled with Nujol (a liquid paraffin). Nujol has the same refractive index as the glass bounding the test section as well as the outer jacket of the cell. Thus, the Nujol serves two purposes: Reflections at the interfaces are almost eliminated and—from Snell's law—all scattering angles up to  $90^{\circ}$  are contained in experimental angles below  $65^{\circ}$ , making otherwise impossible- to- measure scattering angles measurable. Some representative results of their multiple- scattering measurements for varying optical thicknesses of the particle suspension are shown in Fig. 12- 25. Agreement between experiment and theory is excellent except for very small and very large optical thicknesses. For small thicknesses the experiment could not regenerate the maxima and minima, probably as a result of uncertainty in the particle size distribution. Disagreement for large thicknesses stems from the fact that Smart and coworkers also used Hartel's approximate theory. Orchard [178] pointed out that using Hartel's approximation leads to a transmissivity of 0.5 for a medium of infinite optical thickness (rather than the correct value of zero). Therefore, Hottel and coworkers [172] used the method of discrete ordinates, which may be made arbitrarily accurate for sufficient numbers of "ordinates,"4 to calculate bidirectional reflectance and transmissivity for a particle layer. Some representative data in Fig. 12- 26 show the excellent agreement between theory and experiment for optical thicknesses up to 775. Very similar experiments, also using the method of discrete ordinates for theoretical calculations, were carried out by Brewster and Tien [5] and Yamada, Cartigny, and Tien [6] for large polydivinyl spheres in air, resulting in equally good agreement between experiment and theory. A different approach to avoiding reflection and refraction losses, and to measuring scattering intensities at oblique angles, was taken by Daniel and coworkers [179], who measured the phase function for aqueous suspensions of unicellular algae. They used a rotatable fiber- optic detector immersed inside the large dish filled with a dilute algae suspension.

Measurements of the radiative properties of soot have become important for a number of reasons. For one, soot is a very strong radiator and more often than not dominates the heat

transfer in sooty flames. For another, soot is a pollutant and various nonintrusive optical (i.e., radiative) experiments have been designed for its in situ detection, such as transmission, scattering, and emission (via laser- induced incandescence or LII) schemes. A state- of- the art device to measure soot extinction coefficients is shown in Fig. 12- 27 [180]. The facility is known as the Large Agglomerate Optics Facility (LAOF) at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), and it is used to measure extinction coefficients of soot generated by various fuels burning under laminar or turbulent conditions. Soot from the laminar or turbulent burner is collected with minimal disturbance of the flame. The collected soot is diluted with air prior to entering the transmission cell. The soot and gas mixture enters the cell at location 1 and exits at location 2. Several near- monochromatic laser sources are available for transmission measurements. The laser beams pass through air- purged "light tubes" at both end, in order to prevent soot deposition on optical surfaces, and the signal can be collected with a choice of detectors (such as the InGaAs and photodiode detectors indicated in the figure). When steady state is reached the mixture is directed across the filter, and the collected soot is carefully weighed after the experiment (with  $2 - 5\mu \mathrm{g}$  uncertainty). In addition to extinction measurements the LAOF also collects total scattering data using a reciprocal nephelometer, as also indicated in the figure. The apparatus has been used to measure radiative properties of soot from turbulent acetylene and ethene flames [180], laminar acetylene and ethene flames [181], and turbulent JP- 8 combustion [182]

Other measurements of scattering media include properties of titanium dioxide powders, for which Kuhn and coworkers [183] used a loose layer of a powder (20 nm to  $3\mu \mathrm{m}$  in diameter) supported on a film, while Cabrera and colleagues [184] suspended the  $\mathrm{TiO_2}$  particles in water; both used an integrating sphere to capture directional- hemispherical values of the layer's transmissivity and reflectivity. A similar experiment was used by Yaroslavsky et al. [185] to capture the radiative properties of biological turbid media. Brewster and Yamada [186] discussed how properties of turbid media can be deduced from time- resolved measurements (using ps pulses), overcoming some of the difficulties of traditional methods; they applied the new scheme to solutions of latex particles.

The measurement of scattered intensity into the near- forward direction poses a unique set of problems, because the signal may vary by several orders of magnitude over a few degrees of scattering angle, and because separating the transmitted radiation from forward scattering is difficult. Although sometimes employed for particle sizing and the determination of the index of refraction, near- forward scattering is of importance primarily in applications with large geometric paths, such as atmospheric scattering, scattering effects on visibility in the seas, astrophysical applications, and so on. In heat transfer applications forward scattering is generally of small importance, since treating it as transmitted radiation usually results in negligible errors. The reader interested in such experiments is referred to the papers by Spinrad and coworkers [187].

# Problems

12.1 A mass of  $m(\mathrm{kg})$  of coal is ground into particles of equal size  $a(\mu \mathrm{m})$ , which may be assumed to be "large" and black. Determine the optical thickness (based on radius  $R$ ) of the resulting spherical particle cloud, assuming that the particles are uniformly distributed throughout the volume.

12.2 One way to determine the number of particles in a gas is to measure the absorption coefficient for the cloud. For a cloud of large, diffuse particles  $(x \gg 1, \epsilon_{\lambda} = 0.4)$ , the particle distribution function is known to be of the form

$$
n(a) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}C = \mathrm{const}, & 100\mu \mathrm{m}< a< 500\mu \mathrm{m},\\ 0, & \mathrm{elsewhere}. \end{array} \right.
$$

If  $\kappa_{\lambda}$  is measured as  $1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , determine  $C$  and the total number of particles per  $\mathrm{cm}^3$ .

12.3 Coal particles (gray and diffuse with  $\epsilon = 0.9, m = 1.925 - 0.1i$ ) are burnt in a long cylindrical combustion chamber. The combustor is well stirred, resulting in a uniform distribution of particles with a size distribution of

$$
n(a) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}1.5\times 10^{8}\mathrm{m}^{-4}, & a_{\mathrm{min}} = 1\mathrm{mm}< a< a_{\mathrm{max}} = 3\mathrm{mm},\\ 0, & \mathrm{otherwise}. \end{array} \right.
$$

Determine the absorption and scattering coefficients of this particle cloud.

12.4 Consider a particle cloud of fixed- size particles (radius  $a$ ) contained between parallel plates  $0 \leq x \leq L = 1\mathrm{m}$ . The volume fraction of particles is  $f_{v}(x) = f_{0} + \Delta f(x / L)$ , and their temperature is  $T(x) = T_{0} + \Delta T(x / L)$ , where  $\Delta f / f_{0} = \Delta T / T_{0} = 1$ ,  $f_{0} = 1\%$ ,  $T_{0} = 500\mathrm{K}$ . Assuming the particle size to be  $a = 500\mu \mathrm{m}$ , and made of a material with a gray hemispherical emittance of  $\epsilon_{\lambda} = 0.7$ , show that the large- particle approximation may be used for the infrared. Calculate the local, spectral absorption and scattering coefficients. Determine the local Planck- mean extinction coefficient as well as the total optical thickness of the slab (based on the Planck- mean).

12.5 Black spheres of radius  $a = 10\mu \mathrm{m}$  occupy a semi- infinite space with varying number density  $N_{T} = N_{0}e^{- z / L}$ $(N_{0} = 10^{4} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}, L = 1\mathrm{m})$ . If a HeNe laser  $(\lambda = 0.633\mu \mathrm{m})$  shines onto this layer (at  $z = 0$  into the  $z$ - direction), what fraction of its energy is directly transmitted?

12.6 Pulverized coal is burned in a combustor. In order to achieve maximum radiative heat transfer rates, it is desired to keep the optical thickness of the particle cloud at intermediate levels, say  $\tau_{L} = \kappa L = 1$ , in the intermediate infrared, or  $\lambda = 5\mu \mathrm{m}$ , where  $L = 1\mathrm{m}$  is a characteristic combustor dimension. Determine the necessary volume fraction of coal dust, if its size distribution may be taken as

$$
n(a)\propto \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}a^{-3}, & 100\mu \mathrm{m}\leq a\leq 1000\mu \mathrm{m},\\ 0, & \mathrm{all~other}~a. \end{array} \right.
$$

The spectral, hemispherical emittance of coal at  $\lambda = 5\mu \mathrm{m}$  is  $\epsilon_{\lambda} = 0.7$ .

12.7 To maximize radiative heat loss from a hot medium it is usually desirable for the medium to have an intermediate optical thickness. A nonparticipating hot gas at  $1000\mathrm{K}$  occupying the  $1\mathrm{m}$  wide space

between two parallel plates is to be seeded with platinum particles to make the optical thickness of the slab (based on extinction) unity  $(\tau_{L} = 1.0)$ . For this purpose a total of  $2\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$  particles are to be used (density of platinum  $\approx 20\mathrm{g / cm^3}$ ).

(a) To what particle radius must the platinum be ground in order to achieve the desired result? 
(b) Instead, if platinum spheres of radii  $50\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  are available, how much of each (for a total of  $2\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$ ) must be used to achieve the same result?

12.8 The distribution function of a particle cloud may be approximated by an exponential function such as  $n(a) = Ca^2 e^{- ba}$ , where  $a$  is particle radius and  $b$  and  $C$  are constants. It is proposed to determine the distribution function of a set of particles by suspending a measured mass of particles between parallel plates, followed by measuring extinction across the particle layer. Given that  $m'' = 0.05\mathrm{g / cm^2}$  of particles are present between the plates, which are  $10\mathrm{cm}$  apart, and that the optical thickness based on extinction has been measured as  $\tau_0 = 2$ :

(a) Determine the distribution function above (i.e.,  $b$  and  $C$ ). 
(b) If a single particle size were to be used to achieve the same extinction with the same mass of particles, what would the particle radius be?

You may assume all particles to be "large" and diffuse spheres with an emittance of 0.7 and a density of  $\rho = 2\mathrm{g / cm^3}$ .

12.9 Consider a particle cloud with a distribution function of  $n(a) = Ca^2 e^{- ba}$ , where  $a$  is particle radius and  $b$  and  $C$  are constants. The particles are coal  $(\epsilon = 1)$ , and measurements show the particles occupy a volume fraction of  $1\%$ , while the number density has been measured as  $N_{T} = 10^{6} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Calculate the extinction, absorption, and scattering coefficients of the cloud for the wavelength range  $1\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < 4\mu \mathrm{m}$ .

12.10 A LIDAR laser beam (operating in the green at  $\lambda = 0.6\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) is shot into the sky. At a height of  $1\mathrm{km}$  the laser encounters a  $200\mathrm{m}$  thick cloud consisting of water droplets of varying size  $(100\mu \mathrm{m}\leq a\leq 200\mu \mathrm{m})$ , but constant particle distribution function everywhere  $(n = 500 / \mu \mathrm{m}\mathrm{m}^3)$ . What fraction of the laser beam will be transmitted through the cloud? How much will be absorbed? Very approximately, how much would you expect to get scattered back to the Earth's surface? Carefully justify your statements about absorption and scattering, using estimates, graphs, and/or physical arguments for support. Qualitatively, how would your explanation change, if you take into account that  $k = 10^{- 7}$  (i.e., droplets are not opaque)?

Note: Water at  $0.6\mu \mathrm{m}$  has an index of refraction of  $m\simeq 1.35 - 10^{- 7}i$ . For the sake of this problem you may assume the droplets to be opaque (not really true).

12.11 In a coal- burning plant, pulverized coal is used that is known to have a particle size distribution function of

$$
n(a)\propto a^2 e^{-Aa^\epsilon},A = 3\times 10^{-11}\mu \mathrm{m}^{-6}.
$$

The coal may be approximated as diffuse spheres with a gray emittance of  $\epsilon = 0.3$ . What is the effective minimum size parameter,  $z_{\mathrm{min}}$  (i.e.,  $90\%$  by weight of all particles have a size parameter larger than that)? You may assume a combustion temperature of  $\approx 2000\mathrm{K}$ , i.e., the relevant wavelengths range from about  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$  to about  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$ . If the furnace is loaded with  $10\mathrm{kg}$  coal particles per cubic meter, what are the spectral absorption and scattering coefficients? (Density of the coal  $= 2000\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$ .)

12.12 Consider nitrogen mixed with spherical particles at a rate of  $10^{8}$  particles  $/\mathrm{m}^{3}$ . The particles have a radius of  $300\mu \mathrm{m}$  and are diffuse- gray with  $\epsilon = 0.5$ .

(a) Determine the absorption and scattering coefficients, and the scattering phase function. 
(b) Show how the phase function can be approximated by a Henyey-Greenstein function. 
(c) Can the Crosbie-Davidson model be used for this mixture? 
(d) Compare the different versions of the phase function in a  $\Phi$  vs.  $\cos \Theta$  plot.

12.13 A semi- infinite space is filled with black spheres. At any given distance,  $z$ , away from the plate the particle number density is identical, namely  $N_{T} = 6.3662\times 10^{8}\mathrm{m}^{- 3}$ . However, the radius of the suspended spheres diminishes monotonically away from the surface as

$$
a = a_0e^{-z / L};\quad a_0 = 10^{-4}\mathrm{m},\quad L = 1\mathrm{m}.
$$

(a) Determine the absorption coefficient as a function of  $z$  (you may make the large-particle assumption). 
(b) Determine the optical coordinate as a function of  $z$ . What is the total optical thickness of the semi-infinite space?

12.14 A semi- infinite space is filled with black spheres of uniform radius  $a = 100\mu \mathrm{m}$ . The particle number density is maximum adjacent to the surface, and decays exponentially away from the surface according to

$$
N_{T} = N_{0}e^{-Cz};\qquad N_{0} = 10^{8}\mathrm{m}^{-3},\qquad C = \pi \mathrm{m}^{-1}.
$$

(a) Determine the absorption and extinction coefficients as functions of  $z$ .

(b) Determine the optical coordinate as a function of  $z$ . What is the total optical thickness of the semi-infinite space?

12.15 In a combustion chamber radiatively nonparticipating gases are mixed with soot and coal particles. The following is known (per  $\mathrm{m}^3$  of mixture):

Soot: uniform particle size,  $a_{s} = 10\mathrm{nm}$ , mass  $= 10^{- 3}\mathrm{kg}$ , complex index of refraction  $\frac{m^2 - 1}{m^2 + 2} = 0.5\lambda^2 - 0.1\lambda i$  ( $\lambda$  in  $\mu \mathrm{m}$ ). Coal: uniform particle size,  $a_{c} = 1\mathrm{mm}$ , mass  $= 1\mathrm{kg}$ , coal is black.

The density of both, coal and soot, is  $2,000\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^3$ . Determine the spectral absorption coefficient of the mixture for the near infrared.

12.16 In a sheet flame confined between two large parallel plates  $- L\leq z\leq +L = 1\mathrm{m}$  soot is generated mainly in the central flame region, leading to a local soot volume fraction of  $f_{v}(z) = f_{v0}[1 - (z / L)^{2}],$  with  $f_{v0} = 1.07\times 10^{- 6}$  . The soot is propane soot with a complex index of refraction of  $m = 2.21 - 1.23i$

(a) Determine the relevant radiative properties of the mixture, assuming the combustion gases to be nonparticipating. 
(b) What is the spectral optical thickness of the  $2L$  thick layer?

12.17 A laser beam at  $633\mathrm{nm}$  wavelength is probing a  $1\mathrm{m}$  thick layer of gold nanoparticles suspended in air (radius  $a = 10\mathrm{nm}$ ; for gold at  $633\mathrm{nm}$ :  $m = 0.47 - 2.83i$ ). If the exiting laser beam is attenuated by  $10\%$  due to absorption and scattering, determine the number density of gold particles,  $(b)$  their volume fraction.

12.18 A LIDAR laser beam (operating in the green at  $\lambda = 0.6\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) is shot into the sky. At a height of  $1\mathrm{km}$  the laser encounters a  $200\mathrm{m}$  thick cloud consisting of tiny water droplets of varying size ( $1\mathrm{nm}\leq a\leq 20\mathrm{nm}$ ), but constant particle distribution function everywhere ( $n = 6\times 10^{15} / \mathrm{mm}\mathrm{m}^3$ ).

(a) Determine the water droplet volume fraction in the cloud. 
(b) Determine its spectral absorption coefficient; compare with equation (12.123). 
(c) What fraction of the laser beam will be transmitted through the cloud? How much will be absorbed?

Note: Water at  $0.6\mu \mathrm{m}$  has an index of refraction of  $m\simeq 1.35 - 10^{- 7}i$ .

12.19 Redo Problem 12.4 for propane soot with a single mean radius of  $a_{m} = 0.1\mu \mathrm{m}$  in a flame with  $f_{0} = 10^{- 6}$  and  $T_{0} = 1500\mathrm{K}$ . Show that the small particle limit is appropriate for, say,  $\lambda >3\mu \mathrm{m}$ . For hand calculations you may approximate the index of refraction by a single average value (say, at  $3\mu \mathrm{m}$ ), and the emissive power by Wien's law.

12.20 Redo Problem 12.19 for the case that the soot has agglomerated into mass fractal aggregates of  $1000$  soot particles each ( $D_{f} = 1.77$  and  $k_{f} = 8.1$ ).

12.21 Consider a particle cloud with a distribution function of  $n(a) = Ca^{2}e^{- ba}$ , where  $a$  is particle radius and  $b$  and  $C$  are constants. The particles are soot ( $m\simeq 1.5 - 0.5i$ ), and measurements show the soot occupies a volume fraction of  $10^{- 5}$ , while the number density has been measured as  $N_{T} = 10^{12} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ . Calculate the extinction, absorption, and scattering coefficients of the cloud for the wavelength range  $1\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < 4\mu \mathrm{m}$ .

# CHAPTER 13

# RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF SEMITRANSPARENT MEDIA

# 13.1 INTRODUCTION

Any solid or liquid that allows electromagnetic waves to penetrate an appreciable distance into it is known as a semitransparent medium. What constitutes an "appreciable distance" depends, of course, on the physical system at hand. If a thick film on top of a substrate allows a substantial amount of photons to propagate, say,  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  into it, the film material would be considered semitransparent. On the other hand, if heat transfer within a large vat of liquid glass is of interest, the glass cannot be considered semitransparent for those wavelengths that cannot penetrate several centimeters through the glass.

Pure solids with perfect crystalline or very regular amorphous structures, as well as pure liquids, gradually absorb radiation as it travels through the medium, but they do not scatter it appreciably within that part of the spectrum that is of interest to the heat transfer engineer. If a solid crystal has defects, or if a solid or liquid contains inclusions (foreign molecules or particles, bubbles, etc.), the material may scatter as well as absorb. In some instances semitransparent media are inhomogeneous and tend to scatter radiation as a result of their inhomogeneities. An example of such material is aerogel [1], a highly transparent, low heat- loss window material made of tiny hollow glass spheres pressed together.

A number of theoretical models exist to predict the absorption and scattering characteristics of semitransparent media. As for opaque surfaces, the applicability of theories is limited, and they must be used in conjunction with experimental data. In this chapter we shall limit ourselves to absorption within semitransparent media. The models describing scattering behavior are the same as the ones presented in the previous chapter and will not be further discussed here. In particular, scattering from turbid media, insulation, foams, etc., has been summarized near the end of Section 12.12.

# 13.2 ABSORPTION BY SEMITRANSPARENT SOLIDS

The absorption behavior of ionic crystals can be rather successfully modeled by the Lorentz model, which was discussed in some detail in Chapters 2 and 3. The Lorentz theory predicts

FIGURE 13-1Spectral absorption coefficients of several ionic crystals at room temperature [2].FIGURE 13-2Spectral absorption coefficient of several halides at room temperature [2].

that an ionic crystal has one or more Reststrahlen bands in the midinfrared  $(\lambda > \simeq 5\mu \mathrm{m})$  (photon excitation of lattice vibrations). The wavelength at which strong absorption commences because of Reststrahlen bands is often called the long- wavelength absorption edge. The spectral absorption coefficients and their long- wavelength absorption edges are shown for a number of ionic crystals in Fig. 13- 1. Note that these crystals are essentially transparent over much of the near infrared, and become very rapidly opaque at the onset of Reststrahlen bands.

The Lorentz model also predicts that the excitation of valence band electrons, across the band gap into the conduction band, results in several absorption bands at short wavelengths (usually around the ultraviolet). Figure 13- 2 shows the absorption coefficient and short- wavelength absorption edge for several halides: Materials that are essentially opaque in the ultraviolet become highly transparent in the visible and beyond.

Pure solids are generally highly transparent between the two absorption edges. If large amounts of localized lattice defects and/or dopants (foreign- material molecules called color centers) are present, electronic excitations may occur at other wavelengths in between. A number of models predict the absorption characteristics of such defects, some sophisticated, some simple

and semiempirical. For example, Bhattacharyya and Streetman [3] and Blomberg and coworkers [4] developed models predicting the effect of dopants on the absorption coefficient of silicon. Figure 13- 3 shows a comparison of the model by Blomberg and coworkers with experimental data of Siregar and colleagues [5] and Boyd and coworkers [6] for phosphorus- doped silicon at  $10.6\mu \mathrm{m}$  (a wavelength of great importance for materials processing with  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  lasers). The absorption coefficient increases strongly with dopant concentration and with temperature. According to both models, the rise with temperature is due to increases in the number of free electrons and to their individual contributions. The same trends were observed by Timans [7] for the wavelength range between 1.1 and  $1.6\mu \mathrm{m}$ .

The absorption behavior of amorphous, i.e., noncrystalline solids is much more difficult to predict, although the general trends are quite similar. By far the most important semitransparent amorphous solid is soda- lime glass (ordinary window glass, as opposed to the quartz or silicon dioxide crystals depicted in Fig. 13- 1). A number of investigators measured the absorption behavior of window glass, notably Genzel [8], Neuroth [9, 10], Grove and Jellyman [11], and Bagley and coworkers [12]. Figure 1- 17 shows the behavior of the spectral absorption coefficient of window glass for a number of different temperatures. As expected from the data for the transmissivity of window panes (Figs. 3- 28 and 3- 29), glass is fairly transparent for wavelengths  $\lambda < 2.5\mu \mathrm{m}$ ; beyond that it tends to become rather opaque.

The temperature dependence for quartz has been observed to be similar to that of silicon by Beder and coworkers [13], who reported a fourfold increase of the absorption coefficient between room temperature and  $1500^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ .

# 13.3 ABSORPTION BY SEMITRANSPARENT LIQUIDS

The absorption properties of semitransparent liquids are quite similar to those of solids, while they also display some behavior similar to molecular gases. Remnants of intermolecular vibrations (Reststrahlen bands) are observed in many liquids, as are remnants of electronic band gap transitions in the ultraviolet. In the wavelengths in between, molecular vibration bands

are observed for molecules with permanent dipole moments, similar to the vibration- rotation bands of gases.

Because of its abundance in the world around us (and, indeed, inside our own bodies) the absorption properties of water (and its solid form as ice) are by far the most important and, therefore, have been studied extensively, indeed for centuries. The data of many investigators for clear water and clear ice have been collected and interpreted by Irvine and Pollack [14] and by Ray [15]. Another review, limited to pure water, has been given by Hale and Querry [16]. More recent measurements have been reported by Kou and colleagues [17] (water and ice for wavelengths below  $2.5\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) and by Marley and coworkers [18] (water between  $3.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $11\mu \mathrm{m}$ ). The spectral absorption coefficient of clear water (at room temperature) and of clear ice (at  $- 10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ) is shown in Fig. 13- 4, based on the tabulations of Irvine and Pollack [14], Kou and colleagues [17] and Marley and coworkers [18]. Note the similarity between solid ice and liquid water. The lowest points of the absorption spectra of water and ice lie in the visible, making them virtually transparent over short distances. The minimum point lies in the blue part of the visible ( $\lambda \simeq 0.45\mu \mathrm{m}$ ): Large bodies of water (or clear ice) transmit blue light the most, giving them a bluish hue. In the near- to midinfrared water and ice display several absorption bands (at 1.45, 1.94, 2.95, 4.7, and  $6.05\mu \mathrm{m}$  in water, somewhat shifted for ice). These bands are very similar to the water vapor bands at 1.38, 1.87, 2.7, and  $6.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  (see Table 11.3). Agreement between the data of Irvine and Pollack, and that of Kou and colleagues is excellent, while the data of Marley and coworkers in the longer wavelength region are considerably lower than those of Irvine and Pollack: measurement of such large absorption coefficients is extremely difficult, and the modern measurements of Marley and coworkers list an average estimated error of better than  $3\%$ . The temperature dependence of the absorption coefficient of water has been investigated by Goldstein and Penner [19] (up to  $209^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ) and by Hale and coworkers [20] (up to  $70^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ) and was found to be fairly weak. As temperature increases, water becomes somewhat more transparent in relatively transparent regions and somewhat more opaque in absorbing regions. A rather detailed discussion of the absorption behavior of clean water and ice has been given by Bohren and Huffman [21]. Natural waters and ice generally contain significant amounts of particulates (small organisms, detritus) and gas bubbles, which tend to increase the absorption rate as well

as to scatter radiation. While a number of measurements have been made on varieties of natural waters and ice, the results are difficult to correlate since the composition of natural waters varies greatly.

The similarity of absorption behavior between the solid and liquid states of a substance is not limited to water. Barker [22] has measured the absorption coefficient of three alkali halides (KBr, NaCl, and LiF) for several temperatures between  $300\mathrm{K}$  and temperatures above the melting point. Since Reststrahlen bands tend to widen with increasing temperature (see Section 3.5), the long- wavelength absorption edge moves toward shorter wavelengths. No distinct discontinuity in absorption coefficient was observed as the material changed phase from solid to liquid. As an example, the behavior of lithium fluoride (LiF) is depicted in Fig. 13- 5. Semiempirical models for the absorption coefficient of alkali halide crystals, resulting in simple formulae, have been given by Skettrup [23] and Woodruff [24], while a similar formula for alkali halide melts has been developed by Senators and coworkers [25].

# 13.4 RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF POROUS SOLIDS

The applicability of the RTE to heterogeneous media was studied by several investigators, e.g., [26- 38]. In this section we will assume that heterogeneous media can be modeled as homogeneous with radiative intensity described by a local average value based on appropriate continuum properties.

The radiative properties of open cell carbon foam were studied using experimental techniques and a predictive model by Baillis et al. [39]. The model combined elements of geometric optics and diffraction theory applied to the foam geometry determined by microscopic techniques. Extinction, scattering, and absorption coefficients were determined by assuming open cells to consist of struts with varying thickness and strut junctions, as schematically shown in Fig. 13- 6, leading to

![](images/fa44dbad92a41456cfab52f7c73ae2b07036d116d77348b64223df17a840d382.jpg)

$$

where  $N$  is the number of struts per unit volume,  $\bar{G}_{1}$  and  $\bar{G}_{2}$  are the average geometric cross sections of struts and strut junctions, respectively, and  $\rho_{\lambda}$  is the spectral hemispherical reflectance of the solid. Hemispherical reflectances of foam slabs obtained by solving the RTE with the predicted properties agreed well with measured ones, as shown in Fig. 13- 7. Larger discrepancies were observed for the very small, and thus difficult to measure, hemispherical transmittance of a  $4.3\mathrm{mm}$  thick sample.

The radiative properties of highly- porous open- cell metallic foams with inhomogeneities in the size range of geometric optics were studied using simple predictive models by Loretz et al. [42]. The foam structure was determined using microscopic and tomographic techniques. The cells (Fig. 13- 6) were assumed to consist of struts and strut junctions. The extinction coefficient of the cells modeled as pentagon dodecahedrons or tetracaedecahedrons was obtained using the Glicksman and Torpey model [43]:

$$
\beta = 4.09\sqrt{\frac{1 - \epsilon}{D^2}}, \tag{13.4}
$$

where  $\epsilon$  and  $D$  are the porosity and average cell diameter, respectively. For pentagon dodecahedrons with neglected strut junctions equation (13.4) becomes

$$
\beta = \frac{3}{4} 1.305\frac{b}{a^2}, \tag{13.5}
$$

1The factor of  $\frac{1}{2}$  in equation (13.1) is not present in the original paper [39], but was added in more recent work, e.g., [41], perhaps to account for the fact that foam contains fewer strut junctions than struts.

where  $a$  and  $b$  are the strut length and average thickness, respectively, as indicated in Fig. 13- 6.

The radiative properties of closed- cell foams were studied for expanded polystyrene foam by Coquard et al. [44,45], and those for extruded polystyrene foams were predicted and verified experimentally by Kaemmerlein and coworkers [40]. The properties were determined using the integration method of [46] applied to the curved- triangular foam cell wall and strut geometries of Fig. 13- 6. Radiative conductivity  $k_{r}$  was calculated employing the Rosseland- mean extinction coefficient, which in turn was calculated by independently determining the extinction coefficients of struts and of thin films of polystyrene. Due to the low density of the foam, independent scattering was assumed to hold, and the bulk extinction coefficient was determined by adding contributions from struts and walls, similar to equation (13.1). Figure 13- 8 shows  $k_{r}$  with and without a correction factor to the scattering efficiency to account for the concave shape of circular struts, which leads to a noticeable decrease in the variation of  $k_{r}$  with the strut fraction as compared to the uncorrected results. However, as the authors noticed, the trends between predicted and measured radiative conductivities are different.

A more extensive discussion of the radiative properties of open- cell and closed- cell foams may be found in the book by Dombrovsky and Baillis [41].

Monte Carlo ray tracing methods have been employed in a number of studies for the determination of effective radiative properties of heterogeneous media based on the geometry and properties of individual medium components. Tancrez and Taine [29] presented methodology for porous media with opaque solid phase, which was extended to media with semitransparent solids [33]. Coquard and Baillis applied ray tracing to determine the radiative properties of beds of opaque, diffusely or specularly reflecting particles [47]. The latter study was extended to beds of spheres containing an absorbing and scattering medium [48], and also applied to the actual geometry of polymeric foams obtained by tomography [49]. Also using tomography, the geometry of reticulated porous ceramics (RPC) with an opaque solid phase was obtained by Petrasch et al. [50] and by Hausserer et al. [51]; the latter also used this technique for reacting packed beds with an opaque solid phase [52]. Finally, mullite foam with a semitransparent solid phase was studied by Zeghondy and coworkers [33]. In the tomography- based Monte Carlo methods used to study radiative properties of reticulated porous ceramics (Fig. 13- 9) [29, 33, 50, 51] the media were assumed to be statistically homogeneous and isotropic, and the solid phase was assumed to be opaque. Diffraction effects were neglected and geometric optics was assumed to be valid. A large number  $N_{r}$  of stochastic rays were launched in the void phase of a subvolume  $V_{0}$  of a representative elementary volume  $V$ . Rays were traced until they interacted with the solid- void interface or were lost at the faces of  $V$ . For each ray colliding with the solid phase the

![](images/b22cc02330288fe3e7433bda2d188b2d20a595c6c0d3f36216cb6a21446f31e3.jpg)  
FIGURE 13-9 3D rendering of Rh-coated reticulated porous ceramics with nominal pore diameter  $d_{\mathrm{nom}} = 2.54\mathrm{mm}$  obtained using computed tomography techniques [50].

distance to collision was recorded, and rays were either absorbed or reflected, either specularly or diffusely. The distribution function for attenuation path length was then computed as

$$
F_{s} = \frac{1}{N_{r}}\int_{s = 0}^{s}dN(s) = 1 - \exp (-\beta s), \tag{13.6}
$$

where  $dN(s)$  is the number of rays attenuated within  $ds$  around  $s$ ;  $F_{s}$  quantifies the probability of a ray hitting the solid- void interface at a location between 0 and  $s$ . The scattering and absorption coefficients were then obtained from equations (13.2) and (13.3).

Figure 13- 10 shows the radiative intensity obtained numerically and experimentally as a function of normalized path length. The relative difference of  $10\%$  between experimental  $(\beta_{\mathrm{ex}})$  and Monte Carlo- determined  $(\beta_{\mathrm{MC}})$  extinction coefficient was attributed to the effect of local material anisotropy for finite and relatively small RPC samples. Monte Carlo results were integrated over all solid angles, while the experimental measurements were carried out only along a single direction.

# 13.5 EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

The spectral absorption coefficient of a semitransparent solid or liquid can be measured in several ways. The simplest and most common method is to measure the transmissivity of a sample of known thickness, as described in Section 12.12 for particulate clouds. Since solids and liquids reflect energy at the air interfaces, the transmissivity is often determined by forming a ratio between the transmitted signals from two samples of different thickness. However, the transmission method is not capable of measuring very small or very large absorption coefficients: For samples with large transmissivity small errors in the determination of transmissivity,  $\tau$ , lead to very large errors for the absorption coefficient,  $\kappa$  (since  $\kappa$  is proportional to  $\ln \tau$ ). On the other hand, for a material with large  $\kappa$  sufficient energy for transmission measurements can be passed only through extremely thin samples. Such samples are usually prepared as vacuum- deposited thin films, which do not have the same properties as the parent material [54].

The absorption coefficient may also be determined through a number of different reflection techniques. The reflectivity of an optically smooth interface of a semitransparent medium depends, through the complex index of refraction, on the refractive index  $n$  as well as the absorptive index  $k$ . In turn,  $k$  is related to the absorption coefficient through equation (3.79) as  $\kappa = 4\pi \eta k / n$ , where  $\eta = 1 / \lambda$  is the wavenumber of the radiation inside the medium. Thus,

![](images/bf382f622ee8b7f1ae7bcf418716c72c55e55a3dafd9342643562f416a34c16a.jpg)

two data points are necessary to determine  $n$  and  $k$ . Noting the directional dependence of reflectivity on  $m = n - ik$ , some researchers have measured the specular reflectivity at two different angles. Leupacher and Penzkofer [55] showed that this can lead to very substantial errors. Other researchers have measured the reflectivity at a single angle, using parallel- and perpendicular- polarized light (known as an ellipsometric technique). However, this may also lead to large errors [55]. A new method overcoming these problems has been proposed by Lu and Penzkofer [56]. Using parallel- polarized light they vary the incidence angle until the point of minimum reflectivity at Brewster's angle is found (cf. Figs. 2- 8 and 2- 11).

Another reflection technique exploits the fact that a causal relationship exists between  $n$  and  $k$ , i.e., they are not independent of one another. This causal relationship is known as the Kramers- Kronig relation, which may be expressed as

$$
\delta (\eta) = \frac{\eta}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\ln\rho_{n}(\eta^{\prime})}{\eta^{2} - \eta^{\prime 2}} d\eta^{\prime}, \tag{13.7}
$$

where  $\rho_{n}(\eta)$  is the spectral, normal reflectivity of the sample surface [cf. equation (2.114)], and  $\delta (\eta)$  is the phase angle of the complex reflection coefficient, equation (2.111),

$$
\overline{r_n} = \sqrt{\rho_n} e^{i\delta} = \frac{n - ik - 1}{n - ik + 1}. \tag{13.8}
$$

Thus, if  $\rho_{n}$  is measured for a large part of the spectrum, the phase angle  $\delta$  may be determined from equation (13.7) for wavenumbers well inside the measured spectrum;  $n$  and  $k$  are then readily found from equation (13.8). The method is particularly well suited to experiments employing an FTIR (Fourier transform infrared) spectrometer, which can take broad spectrum measurements over very short times, and which often have a built- in Kramers- Kronig analysis capability. More detailed discussions on the various Kramers- Kronig relations may be found, for example, in the books by Wooten [57] and Bohren and Huffman [21]. A description of the numerical evaluation of equation (13.7) has been given by Wooten [57].

Measurement of physical properties at high temperatures is always difficult, but particularly so for semitransparent media since two properties need to be measured (absorption coefficient as well as interface reflectivity, or equivalently,  $n$  and  $k$ ). Myers and coworkers [58] have given a good review of such methods for solid samples. They also developed a new method

![](images/c07369f1d38b5e2a3d71dbe94c9caf80e8b7c8a1335faacc79bd33c016251d18.jpg)

to determine the optical properties of small, semitransparent, solid samples. Their device is essentially a compact arrangement of that employed by Stierwalt [59], which takes three different radiance measurements in rapid succession. A front and cross- sectional view of their sample heating arrangement is shown in Fig. 13- 11. The slab- shaped sample is mounted within an equalizing nickel block, which is coupled radiatively to the electrically heated tube. The nickel block has four cavities and holes serving as radiance targets. A water- cooled graphite block (not shown) is positioned behind the heating tube to provide a room- temperature background for the through- hole as well as a reference for the detector. Three radiance measurements are made and compared with the reference: (i) the slab sample positioned in front of the blackbody (cavity- hole), (ii) the freely radiating sample (through- hole), and (iii) the blackbody reference. With the relations given in Section 3.8 one can use these measurements to deduce the optical properties  $(n,k,$  and  $\kappa)$ . The method has the advantages that measurements at high temperatures  $(\simeq 1000^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  can be taken, that only a single sample is necessary, and that no optically smooth surfaces are required. On the other hand, the method suffers from the standard weaknesses of transmission methods (see discussion at the beginning of this section), and is restricted to high temperatures (to produce a strong enough emission signal).

Measurements of the optical properties of a high- temperature liquid are even more challenging. It is more difficult to confine a liquid in a sample holder (which must be horizontal), and more difficult to measure the thickness of the liquid layer. In addition, the layer thickness may be nonuniform because of (often unknown) surface tension effects. Furthermore, high- temperature liquids are often highly reactive, making a sealed chamber necessary. If the vapor pressure becomes substantial at high temperatures, the windows of the sealed chamber will be attacked. Shvarev and coworkers [60] have measured the optical properties of liquid silicon in the wavelength range of  $0.4 - 1.0\mu \mathrm{m}$  with such a sealed- chamber furnace apparatus, using an ellipsometric technique. Barker [22,61] designed an apparatus to measure the optical properties of semitransparent solid slabs and corrosive melts. To isolate the specimen he relied on a windowless chamber with continuous inert- gas purging. His data evaluation required independent measurements of the interface reflectivity, the reflectivity of a platinum mirror, the sample overall reflectivity, and the thickness of the sample. In addition, the reflectivity of the platinum- liquid interface must be estimated. As such, Barker's method appears to be very vulnerable to experimental error.

A more accurate device, limited to absorption coefficients of liquids, has been reported by Ebert and Self [62]. A schematic of their apparatus is shown in Fig. 13- 12a. The aperture of a blackbody source at  $1700^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  is imaged (by the spherical mirror M3) onto the platinum mirror located in an alumina crucible inside the furnace. The reflected signal is focused onto

the monochromator and detector via another spherical mirror (M5). The beam is chopped to eliminate emission as well as background radiation from the signal. The transmissivity of the liquid is measured by what they called a "submerged reflector method," illustrated in Fig. 13- 12b: A platinum mirror, which may be adjusted via three support rods, is submerged below the surface of the liquid filling the crucible. The platinum mirror is tilted slightly from the horizontal to allow the first surface reflection and multiple internal reflections to be rejected from the collection optics. The thickness of the liquid layer is adjusted by raising and lowering the crucible (leaving the platinum mirror in place). As in the transmission technique, signals for two different layer thicknesses ( $d_{1}$  and  $d_{2}$ ) are ratioed, giving the transmissivity for a layer of thickness  $2(d_{2} - d_{1})$ . By rejecting the first reflection, and by being able to produce and measure very thin liquid layers, they were able to measure absorption coefficients in an order of magnitude higher than Barker, reporting values as high as  $70\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  for synthetic molten slags [62]. Similar measurements have been carried out by Gupta and Modest [63] (lithium salts), by Makino and coworkers [64] (alkali metal carbonates), and by Zhang and colleagues [65] (liquid glasses).

Foams and Packed Fibers. Measurements on foams were done by Kuhn and coworkers [66] (polystyrene and polyurethane foam insulation), Sacadura et al. [67- 69] (fiberglass and carbon foam), Mital and colleagues [70], and Hendricks and Howell [71] (reticulated porous ceramics). The bidirectional reflectance of mullite foam has been measured by Zeghondy and coworkers [72], which agreed well with model results based on the Monte Carlo tool of Tancrez and Taine [29, 33]. Cunnington and coworkers [73] measured the scattering from individual, coated silica fibers, and found qualitative agreement with a theoretical model. Cunnington and Lee measured direct transmissivity and hemispherical reflectivity of randomly packed, high- porosity fibrous material (tiles from the Space Shuttle) [74], and for aerogel- reinforced fibrous material [75]; comparison with Lee's models [76- 79] showed excellent agreement for both materials.

# CHAPTER 14

# EXACT SOLUTIONS FOR ONE-DIMENSIONAL GRAY MEDIA

# 14.1 INTRODUCTION

The governing equation for radiative transfer of absorbing, emitting, and scattering media was developed in Chapter 10, resulting in an integro- differential equation for radiative intensity in five independent variables (three space coordinates and two direction coordinates). The problem becomes even more complicated if the medium is nongray (which introduces an additional variable, such as wavelength or frequency) and/or if other modes of heat transfer are present (which make it necessary to solve simultaneously for overall conservation of energy, to which intensity is related in a nonlinear way). Consequently, exact analytical solutions exist for only a few extremely simple situations. The simplest case arises when one considers thermal radiation in a one- dimensional plane- parallel gray medium that is either at radiative equilibrium (i.e., radiation is the only mode of heat transfer) or whose temperature field is known. Analytical solutions for such simple problems have been studied extensively, partly because of the great importance of one- dimensional plane- parallel media, partly because the simplicity of such solutions allows testing of more general solution methods, and partly because such a solution can give qualitative indications for more difficult situations.

In the present chapter we develop some analytical solutions for one- dimensional planeparallel media and also include a few solutions for one- dimensional cylindrical and spherical media (without development). In general, we shall assume the medium to be gray, and all radiative intensity- related quantities are total, i.e., frequency- integrated quantities, for example,  $\begin{array}{r}I_{b} = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\nu}d\nu = n^{2}\sigma T^{4} / \pi \end{array}$  . Most relations also hold, on a spectral basis, for nongray media, except for those that utilize the statement of radiative equilibrium,  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = 0$  (since this relation does not hold on a spectral basis).

# 14.2 GENERAL FORMULATION FOR A PLANE-PARALLEL MEDIUM

The governing equation for the intensity field in an absorbing, emitting, and scattering medium is, from equation (10.24),

$$
\mathbf{\hat{s}}\cdot \nabla I = \kappa I_{b} - \beta I + \frac{\sigma_{s}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i},\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega_{i}, \tag{14.1}
$$

![](images/c5e0f6ff777e4aa33aa4330b9e7b57326083992f732d8888dc22e721fa4a7150.jpg)  
FIGURE 14-1 Coordinates for radiative intensities in a one-dimensional plane-parallel medium: (a) upward directions, (b) downward directions.

which describes the change of radiative intensity along a path in the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ . The formal solution to equation (14.1) is given by equation (10.28) as

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_w(\hat{\mathbf{s}})e^{-\tau_s} + \int_0^{\tau_s}S(\tau_s',\hat{\mathbf{s}})e^{-(\tau_s - \tau_s')}d\tau_s', \tag{14.2}
$$

where  $S$  is the radiative source term, equation (10.25),

$$
S(\tau_s^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = (1 - \omega)I_b(\tau_s^{\prime}) + \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I(\tau_s^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)d\Omega_i, \tag{14.3}
$$

and  $\tau_{s} = \int_{0}^{s}\beta (s)ds$  is optical thickness or optical depth based on extinction coefficient<sup>1</sup> measured from a point on the wall  $(\tau_s = 0)$  toward the point under consideration  $(\tau_s' = \tau_s)$ , in the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ . For a plane- parallel medium the change of intensity is illustrated in Fig. 14- 1a, measuring polar angle  $\theta$  from the direction perpendicular to the plates (z- direction), and azimuthal angle  $\psi$  in a plane parallel to the plates (x- y- plane): Radiative intensity of strength  $I_w(\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_w(\theta ,\psi)$  leaves the point on the bottom surface into the direction of  $\theta ,\psi$ , toward the point under consideration,  $P$ . This intensity is augmented by the radiative source (by emission and by in- scattering, i.e., scattering of intensity from other directions into the direction of  $P$ ). The amount of energy  $S(\tau_s',\theta ,\psi)d\tau_s'$  is released over the infinitesimal optical depth  $d\tau_s'$  and travels toward  $P$ . Since this energy also undergoes absorption and out- scattering along its path from  $\tau_s'$  to  $\tau_s$ , only the fraction  $e^{- (\tau_s' - \tau_s')}$  actually arrives at  $P$ . In general, the intensity leaving the bottom wall may vary across the bottom surface, and radiative source and medium properties may vary throughout the medium, i.e., in the directions parallel to the plates as well as normal to them.

We shall now assume that both plates are isothermal and isotropic, i.e., neither temperature nor radiative properties vary across each plate and properties may show a directional dependence on polar angle  $\theta$ , but not on azimuthal angle  $\psi$ . Thus, the intensity leaving the bottom plate at a certain location is the same for all azimuthal angles and, indeed, for all positions on that plate; it is a function of polar angle  $\theta$  alone. We also assume that the temperature field and radiative properties of the medium vary only in the direction perpendicular to the plates. This assumption implies that the radiative source at position  $Q$ ,  $S(\tau_s',\theta)$ , is identical to the one at position  $Q_s$ ,  $S(\tau_s',\theta)$ , or any horizontal position with identical  $z$ - coordinate  $\tau ' = \int_0^{z'}\beta dz$  (based on extinction coefficient). Therefore, radiative source,  $S(\tau ,\theta)$ , and radiative intensity,  $I(\tau ,\theta)$ , both depend only on a single space coordinate plus a single direction coordinate. The radiative

source term may be simplified for the one- dimensional case to

$$
S(\tau^{\prime},\theta) = (1 - \omega)I_{b}(\tau^{\prime}) + \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\int_{\psi_{i} = 0}^{2\pi}\int_{\theta_{i} = 0}^{\pi}I(\tau^{\prime},\theta_{i})\Phi (\theta ,\psi ,\theta_{i},\psi_{i})\sin \theta_{i}d\theta_{i}d\psi_{i}. \tag{14.4}
$$

For isotropic scattering,  $\Phi \equiv 1$ , and we find immediately from the definition for incident radiation,  $G$  [equation (10.32)], that

$$
S(\tau^{\prime}) = (1 - \omega)I_{b}(\tau^{\prime}) + \frac{\omega}{4\pi} G(\tau^{\prime}). \tag{14.5}
$$

In other words, the source term does not depend on direction, that is, the radiative source due to isotropic emission and isotropic in- scattering is also isotropic.

If the scattering is anisotropic, we may write, from equation (12.99),2

$$
\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = 1 + \sum_{m = 1}^{M}A_mP_m(\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i), \tag{14.6}
$$

where it is assumed that the series may be truncated after  $M$  terms. Measuring the polar angle from the  $z$ - axis and the azimuthal angle from the  $x$ - axis (in the  $x - y$ - plane) for both  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$ , we get the direction vectors

$$
\begin{array}{c}\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \sin \theta (\cos \psi \hat{\mathbf{i}} +\sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{j}}) + \cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{k}},\\ \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i = \sin \theta_i(\cos \psi_i\hat{\mathbf{i}} +\sin \psi_i\hat{\mathbf{j}}) + \cos \theta_i\hat{\mathbf{k}}, \end{array} \tag{14.8}
$$

and

$$
\Phi (\theta ,\psi ,\theta_{i},\psi_{i}) = 1 + \sum_{m = 1}^{M}A_{m}P_{m}[\cos \theta \cos \theta_{i} + \sin \theta \sin \theta_{i}\cos (\psi -\psi_{i})]. \tag{14.9}
$$

Using a relationship between Legendre polynomials [1], one may separate the directional dependence in the last relationship by

$$
\begin{array}{l}{P_m[\cos \theta \cos \theta_i + \sin \theta \sin \theta_i\cos (\psi -\psi_i)] = P_m(\cos \theta)P_m(\cos \theta_i)}\\ {+2\sum_{n = 1}^{m}\frac{(m - n)!}{(m + n)!} P_n^m (\cos \theta)P_n^m (\cos \theta_i)\cos m(\psi -\psi_i),} \end{array} \tag{14.10}
$$

where the  $P_n^m$  are associated Legendre polynomials. Thus, the scattering phase function may be rewritten as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\Phi (\theta ,\psi ,\theta_{i},\psi_{i}) = 1 + \sum_{m = 1}^{M}A_{m}P_{m}(\cos \theta)P_{m}(\cos \theta_{i})}\\ {+2\sum_{m = 1}^{M}\sum_{n = 1}^{m}A_{m}\frac{(m - n)!}{(m + n)!} P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta)P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta_{i})\cos m(\psi -\psi_{i}).} \end{array} \tag{14.11}
$$

For a one- dimensional plane- parallel geometry, the intensity does not depend on azimuthal angle, and we may carry out the  $\psi_i$ - integration in equation (14.4). This integration leads to a one- dimensional scattering phase function of

$$
\Phi (\theta ,\theta_{i}) = \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})d\psi_{i} = 1 + \sum_{m = 1}^{M}A_{m}P_{m}(\cos \theta)P_{m}(\cos \theta_{i}), \tag{14.12}
$$

since  $\int_0^{2\pi}\cos m(\psi - \psi_i)d\psi_i = 0$ . The radiative source then becomes

$$
S(\tau^{\prime},\theta) = (1 - \omega)I_{b}(\tau^{\prime}) + \frac{\omega}{2}\int_{0}^{\pi}I(\tau^{\prime},\theta_{i})\Phi (\theta ,\theta_{i})\sin \theta_{i}d\theta_{i}. \tag{14.13}
$$

For linear- anisotropic scattering, with

$$
\Phi (\pmb {\xi}\cdot \hat{\pmb{s}}_i) = 1 + A_1P_1(\hat{\pmb{s}}\cdot \hat{\pmb{s}}_i) = 1 + A_1\hat{\pmb{s}}\cdot \hat{\pmb{s}}_i,\quad M = 1, \tag{14.14}
$$

and, using the definitions for incident radiation and radiative heat flux, equations (10.32) and (10.52), respectively, equation (14.13) reduces to

$$
S(\tau^{\prime},\theta) = (1 - \omega)I_{b}(\tau^{\prime}) + \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\left[G(\tau^{\prime}) + A_{1}q(\tau^{\prime})\cos \theta \right]. \tag{14.15}
$$

We may now simplify the equation of radiative transfer, equation (14.1), using the geometric relations  $\tau_{s} = \tau /\cos \theta$  and  $\tau_{s}^{\prime} = \tau^{\prime} / \cos \theta$  (see Fig. 14- 1a),

$$
\frac{1}{\beta}\frac{dI}{ds} = \frac{dI}{d\tau_s} = \cos \theta \frac{dI}{d\tau} = (1 - \omega)I_b - I + \frac{\omega}{2}\int_0^\pi I(\tau ,\theta_i)\Phi (\theta ,\theta_i)\sin \theta_id\theta_i. \tag{14.16}
$$

Similarly, the expression for intensity, equation (14.2), may be simplified to

$$
I^{+}(\tau ,\theta) = I_{1}(\theta)e^{-\tau /\cos \theta} + \int_{0}^{\tau}S(\tau^{\prime},\theta)e^{-(\tau -\tau^{\prime}) / \cos \theta}\frac{d\tau^{\prime}}{\cos\theta},\quad 0< \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}, \tag{14.17}
$$

where the intensity is denoted by  $I^{+}$  since equation (14.17) is limited to directions with wall intensities emanating from the lower wall, at  $\tau = 0$  ("positive" directions). Here the radiative source  $S(\tau^{\prime},\theta)$  is given by equation (14.5) for isotropic scattering (or no scattering with  $\omega = 0$ ), by equation (14.15) for linear- anisotropic scattering, and by equations (14.12) and (14.13) for general anisotropic scattering.

A similar relationship is readily developed for intensity emanating from the top wall (traveling into "negative" directions). With  $\tau_{s}^{\prime} = - (\tau_{L} - \tau^{\prime}) / \cos \theta$  and  $\tau_{s} = - (\tau_{L} - \tau) / \cos \theta$  (keeping in mind that  $\cos \theta < 0$  for "negative" directions,  $\theta >\pi /2$ ) we obtain (see Fig. 14- 1b)

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I^{-}(\tau ,\theta) = I_{2}(\theta)e^{(\tau_{L} - \tau) / \cos \theta} + \int_{\tau_{L}}^{\tau}S(\tau^{\prime},\theta)e^{(\tau^{\prime} - \tau) / \cos \theta}\frac{d\tau^{\prime}}{\cos\theta}}\\ {= I_{2}(\theta)e^{(\tau_{L} - \tau) / \cos \theta} - \int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}S(\tau^{\prime},\theta)e^{(\tau^{\prime} - \tau) / \cos \theta}\frac{d\tau^{\prime}}{\cos\theta},\quad \frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \pi ,} \end{array} \tag{14.18}
$$

where  $I_{2}(\theta)$  is the intensity leaving the wall at  $\tau = \tau_{L}$  (Wall 2). It is customary (and somewhat more compact) to rewrite equations (14.16) through (14.18) in terms of the direction cosine  $\mu = \cos \theta$ , or

$$
\mu \frac{dI}{d\tau} +I = (1 - \omega)I_b + \frac{\omega}{2}\int_{-1}^{1}I(\tau ,\mu_i)\Phi (\mu ,\mu_i)d\mu_i = S(\tau ,\mu), \tag{14.19}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I^{+}(\tau ,\mu) = I_{1}(\mu)e^{-\tau /\mu} + \int_{0}^{\tau}S(\tau^{\prime},\mu)e^{-(\tau -\tau^{\prime}) / \mu}\frac{d\tau^{\prime}}{\mu},\qquad 0< \mu < 1,}\\ {I^{-}(\tau ,\mu) = I_{2}(\mu)e^{(\tau_{L} - \tau) / \mu} - \int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}S(\tau^{\prime},\mu)e^{(\tau^{\prime} - \tau) / \mu}\frac{d\tau^{\prime}}{\mu},\qquad -1< \mu < 0.} \end{array} \tag{14.20b}
$$

For heat transfer purposes the incident radiation,  $G$ , and radiative heat flux,  $q$ , are of interest. From the definition of incident radiation, equation (10.32), it follows that

$$
\begin{array}{l}{G(\tau) = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}I(\tau ,\theta)\sin \theta d\theta d\psi = 2\pi \int_{-1}^{+1}I(\tau ,\mu)d\mu}\\ {= 2\pi \left[\int_{-1}^{0}I^{-}(\tau ,\mu)d\mu +\int_{0}^{+1}I^{+}(\tau ,\mu)d\mu \right]}\\ {= 2\pi \left[\int_{0}^{1}I^{-}(\tau , - \mu)d\mu +\int_{0}^{1}I^{+}(\tau ,\mu)d\mu \right]}\\ {= 2\pi \left\{\int_{0}^{1}I_{1}(\mu)e^{-\tau /\mu}d\mu +\int_{0}^{1}I_{2}(-\mu)e^{-(\tau_{L} - \tau) / \mu}d\mu \right.}\\ {\left. + \int_{0}^{1}\left[\int_{0}^{\tau}S(\tau ',\mu)e^{-(\tau -\tau ') / \mu}d\tau ' + \int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}S(\tau ', - \mu)e^{-(\tau ' - \tau) / \mu}d\tau '\right]\frac{d\mu}{\mu}\right\} .} \end{array} \tag{14.21}
$$

Similarly, for the radiative heat flux for a plane- parallel medium, equation (10.52),

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q(\tau) = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}I(\tau ,\theta)\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\psi = 2\pi \int_{-1}^{+1}I(\tau ,\mu)\mu d\mu}\\ {= 2\pi \left\{\int_{0}^{1}I_{1}(\mu)e^{-\tau /\mu}d\mu -\int_{0}^{1}I_{2}(-\mu)e^{-(\tau_{L} - \tau) / \mu}d\mu \right.}\\ {\left. + \int_{0}^{1}\left[\int_{0}^{\tau}S(\tau ',\mu)e^{-(\tau -\tau ') / \mu}d\tau ' - \int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}S(\tau ', - \mu)e^{-(\tau ' - \tau) / \mu}d\tau '\right]d\mu \right\} .} \end{array} \tag{14.22}
$$

During a large part of this chapter we shall study the solution to equations (14.21) and (14.22) for a number of different situations. We shall assume either that the temperature across the medium and, therefore,  $I_{b}(\tau)$  is known or that radiative equilibrium prevails,  $dq / d\tau = 0$ . In either case we are interested in the direction- integrated form of the equation of transfer, equation (14.1), which has been given by equation (10.59) as

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = \kappa (4\pi I_b - G), \tag{14.23}
$$

or, for the present one- dimensional case after division by extinction coefficient  $\beta$  (and remembering that  $\kappa /\beta = 1 - \sigma_{\mathrm{s}} / \beta$ ),

$$
\frac{dq}{d\tau} = (1 - \omega)(4\pi I_b - G). \tag{14.24}
$$

We note in passing that, up to this point, all relations, and in particular equations (14.21), (14.22), and (14.24), hold on a total basis for a gray medium and on a spectral basis for any medium. If radiative equilibrium prevails, then  $dq / d\tau = 0$  or, in the presence of a heat source,

$$
\frac{dq}{d\tau} = \frac{\dot{Q}^{\prime\prime\prime}}{\beta} (\tau), \tag{14.25}
$$

where  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}$  is local heat generation per unit time and volume. Equation (14.25) is valid only for total radiative heat flux and may, therefore, in this form be applied only to gray media. For such a case we see that the incident radiation is closely related to the blackbody intensity (and, therefore, temperature) by

$$
4\pi I_{b}(\tau) = G(\tau) + \frac{\dot{Q}^{\prime\prime\prime}}{\kappa} (\tau). \tag{14.26}
$$

# 14.3 PLANE LAYER OF A NONSCATTERING MEDIUM

# Enclosure with Black Bounding Surfaces

Since this is the most basic of cases, we shall rederive the relationships for this simple problem. From equation (14.3), with  $\omega = 0,$  it follows that  $S(\tau^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})$  ; for black bounding surfaces, the intensity leaving the lower plate is  $I_{1}(\theta) = I_{b1}$  and the intensity leaving the top plate is  $I_{2}(\theta) = I_{b2}$  . Thus, for this simple case, neither radiative source nor boundary intensities are direction- dependent. Equations (14.17) and (14.18) may then be rewritten as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{I^{+}(\tau,\theta)=I_{b1}e^{-\tau/\cos\theta}+\int_{0}^{\tau}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})e^{-(\tau-\tau^{\prime})/\cos\theta}\frac{d\tau^{\prime}}{\cos\theta},\qquad\quad 0< \theta< \frac{\pi}{2},}}\\ {{I^{-}(\tau,\theta)=I_{b2}e^{(\tau_{L}-\tau)/\cos\theta}-\int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})e^{(\tau^{\prime}-\tau)/\cos\theta}\frac{d\tau^{\prime}}{\cos\theta},\qquad\frac{\pi}{2}< \theta< \pi.}}\end{array} \tag{14.27b}
$$

Making the substitution  $\mu = \cos \theta$  transforms this to

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{I^{+}(\tau,\mu)=I_{b1}e^{-\tau/\mu}+\frac{1}{\mu}\int_{0}^{\tau}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})e^{-(\tau-\tau^{\prime})/\mu}d\tau^{\prime},}}&{{\qquad 0< \mu< 1,}}\\ {{I^{-}(\tau,\mu)=I_{b2}e^{(\tau_{L}-\tau)/\mu}-\frac{1}{\mu}\int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})e^{(\tau^{\prime}-\tau)/\mu}d\tau^{\prime},}}&{{\qquad-1< \mu< 0.}}\end{array} \tag{14.28b}
$$

From the definition for incident radiation it follows, from equation (14.21), that

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{G(\tau)=2\pi\left[\int_{-1}^{0}I^{-}(\tau,\mu)d\mu+\int_{0}^{1}I^{+}(\tau,\mu)d\mu\right]}}\\ {{\quad=2\pi\left[I_{b1}\int_{0}^{1}e^{-\tau/\mu}d\mu+I_{b2}\int_{0}^{1}e^{-(\tau_{L}-\tau)/\mu}d\mu\right.}}\\ {{\quad\left.+\int_{0}^{\tau}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})\int_{0}^{1}e^{-(\tau-\tau^{\prime})/\mu}\frac{d\mu}{\mu}d\tau^{\prime}+\int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})\int_{0}^{1}e^{-(\tau^{\prime}-\tau)/\mu}\frac{d\mu}{\mu}d\tau^{\prime}\right].}}\end{array} \tag{14.29}
$$

Taking advantage of the fact that wall intensities and radiative sources do not depend on direction, we have taken these terms out of the direction integrals and reversed the order of integration for the terms describing medium emission.

A similar relationship may be established for radiative heat flux, from equation (14.22), as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{{q(\tau)=2\pi\bigg[I_{b1}\int_{0}^{1}e^{-\tau/\mu}\mu d\mu-I_{b2}\int_{0}^{1}e^{-(\tau_{L}-\tau)/\mu}\mu d\mu}}\\ {{\qquad+\int_{0}^{\tau}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})\int_{0}^{1}e^{-(\tau-\tau^{\prime})/\mu}d\mu d\tau^{\prime}-\int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})\int_{0}^{1}e^{-(\tau^{\prime}-\tau)/\mu}d\mu d\tau^{\prime}\bigg].}}\end{array} \tag{14.30}
$$

We see that none of the important parameters  $G,q,$  and  $I_{b}$  depends on direction, and that direction  $\mu$  enters equations (14.29) and (14.30) only as a dummy integration variable. We may write these equations in more compact form by introducing the exponential integral of order  $n$

$$
E_{n}(x) = \int_{1}^{\infty}e^{-xt}\frac{dt}{t^{n}} = \int_{0}^{1}\mu^{n - 2}e^{-x / \mu}d\mu . \tag{14.31}
$$

Since exponential integrals are of great importance in radiative transfer, a sketch of them is shown in Fig. 14- 2, and a somewhat more detailed discussion is given in Appendix E. For

![](images/3f66bd1fbac236c199831b05a4a60c1c1be255dc741dee3e145b5aa0d805320b.jpg)  
FIGURE 14-2 General behavior of exponential integrals  $E_{n}(x)$ .

our present purposes, we note that exponential integrals behave somewhat like "generalized negative exponentials" and that

$$
E_{n}(0) = \int_{1}^{\infty}\frac{dt}{t^{n}} = \frac{1}{n - 1}, \tag{14.32}
$$

$$
\frac{d}{dx} E_{n}(x) = -E_{n - 1}(x); \quad \text{or} \quad E_{n}(x) = \int_{x}^{\infty} E_{n - 1}(x) dx. \tag{14.33}
$$

Substituting equation (14.31) into equations (14.29) and (14.30) then leads to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{G(\tau) = 2\pi \bigg[I_{b1}E_2(\tau) + I_{b2}E_2(\tau_L - \tau) + \int_0^\tau I_b(\tau ')E_1(\tau -\tau ')d\tau ' + \int_\tau^{\tau_L}I_b(\tau ')E_1(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau '\bigg],}\\ {(14.34)}\\ {q(\tau) = 2\pi \bigg[I_{b1}E_3(\tau) - I_{b2}E_3(\tau_L - \tau) + \int_0^\tau I_b(\tau ')E_2(\tau -\tau ')d\tau ' - \int_\tau^{\tau_L}I_b(\tau ')E_2(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau '\bigg].} \end{array} \tag{14.35}
$$

# Medium with Specified Temperature Field

If radiative heat transfer is not so dominant that conduction and/or convection can be neglected, the problem of finding the temperature distribution and heat fluxes is always nonlinear. For the simplest case of a gray medium with constant properties, the incident radiation, as calculated from equation (14.21), is proportional to temperature to the fourth power, while the conductive and/or convective terms are proportional to temperature itself. Therefore, the temperature field must always be determined through an iterative procedure. In general, this involves guessing a temperature field, which is then used to determine incident radiation  $G$  [from equation (14.34)] and divergence of radiative heat flux  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}$  [from equation (14.24)]. This radiative source term is then substituted into the equation for overall conservation of energy, equation (10.72), from which an improved temperature field is determined. This process is then repeated until the temperature field has converged to within specified criteria. The treatment of combined radiation together with conduction and/or convection is discussed in more detail in Chapter 22. There are also some important industrial applications where outright knowledge

of the temperature field may be assumed, for example, swirling combustion chambers that are essentially isothermal as a result of very strong convection.

For a gray medium equations (14.34) and (14.35) give the total incident radiation  $G$  and radiative flux  $q$ . The radiative source term then follows from

$$
\frac{dq}{d\tau} = (1 - \omega)(4\pi I_b - G). \tag{14.36}
$$

For a nongray medium equations (14.34) and (14.35) provide only spectral values,  $G_{\lambda}$  and  $q_{\lambda}$ , and the total radiative source must be found through integration of

$$
\frac{dq}{dz} = \int_0^\infty \kappa_\lambda (4\pi I_{b\lambda} - G_\lambda)d\lambda . \tag{14.37}
$$

# Medium at Radiative Equilibrium

If other modes of heat transfer are negligible, or are not considered, the temperature distribution is unknown and must be determined from the statement of radiative equilibrium,  $dq / dz = 0$ . This is a total (spectrally integrated) heat flux and, to make the problem tractable, we will limit ourselves to a gray medium [i.e., equations (14.34) and (14.35) deal with total properties, or  $I_{b} = n^{2}\sigma T^{4} / \pi$ ]. We find  $q(\tau) = \text{const}$  and, from equation (14.26),  $G = 4\pi I_{b} = 4n^{2}\sigma T^{4}$ . Equation (14.34) now becomes an integral equation governing the temperature distribution within the medium, or

$$
T^{4}(\tau) = \frac{1}{2}\biggl [T_{1}^{4}E_{2}(\tau) + T_{2}^{4}E_{2}(\tau_{L} - \tau) + \int_{0}^{\tau_{L}}T^{4}(\tau^{\prime})E_{1}(|\tau^{\prime} - \tau |)d\tau^{\prime}\biggr ]. \tag{14.38}
$$

Since the heat flux,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q(\tau) = 2n^{2}\sigma T_{1}^{4}E_{3}(\tau) - 2n^{2}\sigma T_{2}^{4}E_{3}(\tau_{L} - \tau)}\\ {+2\int_{0}^{\tau}n^{2}\sigma T^{4}(\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau -\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime} - 2\int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}n^{2}\sigma T^{4}(\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau^{\prime} - \tau)d\tau^{\prime},} \end{array} \tag{14.39}
$$

does not vary across the medium, it may be evaluated at any location, conveniently chosen as  $\tau = 0$ :

$$
q = n^{2}\sigma T_{1}^{4} - 2n^{2}\sigma T_{2}^{4}E_{3}(\tau_{L}) - 2\int_{0}^{\tau_{L}}n^{2}\sigma T^{4}(\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime}. \tag{14.40}
$$

The difference between equations (14.40) and (14.39) is that equation (14.40) is only valid for radiative equilibrium, and equation (14.39) is valid for the more general case of any gray medium between black plates. For an overall solution the temperature field is found first by solving the integral equation (14.38), after which knowledge of the temperature field is used to determine radiative heat flux from equation (14.39). Unfortunately, no closed- form solution exists to integral equations such as (14.38); a solution has to be found by numerical and/or approximate means. Before proceeding to a solution it is advantageous to reduce the number of parameters in equations (14.38) and (14.39) to a minimum. We introduce a nondimensional emissive power or temperature

$$
\Phi_{b}(\tau) = \frac{T^{4}(\tau) - T_{2}^{4}}{T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4}}, \tag{14.41}
$$

and a nondimensional radiative heat flux

$$
\Psi_{b} = \frac{q}{n^{2}\sigma(T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4})}. \tag{14.42}
$$

FIGURE 14-3 Nondimensional temperature distribution for a gray medium at radiative equilibrium between isothermal plates.

If we substitute these expressions into equations (14.38) and (14.39) and use equations (14.32) and (14.33), we find that

$$
\begin{array}{l}\Phi_{b}(\tau) = \frac{1}{2}\left[E_{2}(\tau) + \int_{0}^{\tau_{L}}\Phi_{b}(\tau^{\prime})E_{1}(|\tau -\tau^{\prime}|)d\tau^{\prime}\right],\\ \displaystyle \Psi_{b}(\tau) = 2\left[E_{3}(\tau) + \int_{0}^{\tau}\Phi_{b}(\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau -\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime} - \int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}\Phi_{b}(\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau^{\prime} - \tau)d\tau^{\prime}\right], \end{array} \tag{14.43}
$$

or

$$
\Psi_{b} = 1 - 2\int_{0}^{\tau_{L}}\Phi_{b}(\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime}. \tag{14.45}
$$

Besides the independent variable  $\tau$ , only one parameter, the medium's optical thickness  $\tau_{L}$ , appears in the governing equations for  $\Phi_{b}$  and  $\Psi_{b}$ : Once  $\Phi_{b}$  has been determined for a given  $\tau_{L}$ , the temperature field and radiative heat flux may be determined for any combination of surface temperatures. Equation (14.43) is a Fredholm integral equation and is readily solved by any of the methods described in Section 5.6. The numerical solution to equations (14.43) and (14.45) was first given by Heaslet and Warming [2]. Figure 14- 3 shows the nondimensional temperature field for a range of optical thicknesses. Some representative nondimensional fluxes are given in Table 14.1.

Examination of Fig. 14- 3 shows that, for radiative equilibrium, there may be a temperature discontinuity at the walls. In the limiting case of a transparent medium,  $\tau_{L} \to 0$ , we have  $\Phi_{b} = \frac{1}{2}$  or  $T^{4} \to (T_{1}^{4} + T_{2}^{4}) / 2 = \mathrm{const}$ , with corresponding temperature jumps at the boundaries (strictly speaking, a transparent or nonparticipating medium,  $\tau_{L} = 0$ , could have any temperature distribution since it would not enter the calculations). The temperature slip decreases as the optical thickness increases until it vanishes for  $\tau_{L} \to \infty$ . In that optically thick limit the nondimensional emissive power profile becomes linear. The situation is not unlike conduction in a rarefied gas: When the mean free path for collision (absorption) is very large, molecules (photons) travel between plates without interference with an average energy equal to the average of surface

temperatures (emissive powers). If the mean free path becomes very small compared with physical dimensions, the conductive flux obeys Fourier's law and the diffusion limit is reached.

# Gray, Diffuse Boundaries

If the walls are not black, but are gray, diffuse emitters and reflectors, the entire development of this section still holds, except that the fluxes leaving the bottom and top plates are no longer  $\pi I_{b1}$  and  $\pi I_{b2}$ , but must be replaced by the radiosities  $J_{1}$  and  $J_{2}$ , respectively:

$$
G(\tau) = 2J_{1}E_{2}(\tau) + 2J_{2}E_{2}(\tau_{L} - \tau) + 2\pi \int_{0}^{\tau}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})E_{1}(\tau -\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime} + 2\pi \int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})E_{1}(\tau^{\prime} - \tau)d\tau^{\prime}, \tag{14.46}
$$

$$
q(\tau) = 2J_{1}E_{3}(\tau) - 2J_{2}E_{3}(\tau_{L} - \tau) + 2\pi \int_{0}^{\tau}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau -\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime} - 2\pi \int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau^{\prime} - \tau)d\tau^{\prime}. \tag{14.47}
$$

The radiosities, accounting for emission as well as diffuse reflection, may be related to the Planck function through equation (5.26) as

$$
{\bf q}_{w}\cdot \hat{\bf n} = \frac{\epsilon_{w}}{1 - \epsilon_{w}}\left(\pi I_{bw} - J_{w}\right), \tag{14.48}
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{rl}\tau = 0: & q_1 = \frac{\epsilon_1}{1 - \epsilon_1}\big(n^2\sigma T_1^4 -J_1\big),\\ \tau = \tau_c: & q_2 = -\frac{\epsilon_2}{1 - \epsilon_2}\big(n^2\sigma T_2^4 -J_2\big). \end{array} \tag{14.49b}
$$

# Medium with Specified Temperature Field

For nonblack surfaces the equations for incident radiation and radiative flux are coupled through the radiosity. First, sticking equations (14.49) into equation (14.47) one can determine the unknown radiosities, after which incident radiation is calculated. The radiative source term is then evaluated as for black surfaces.

Example 14.1. A gray, nonscattering medium with refractive index  $n = 1$  is contained between two parallel, gray plates. The medium is isothermal at temperature  $T_{m}$ , with constant absorption coefficient  $\kappa$ . The two plates are both isothermal at temperature  $T_{w}$ , have the same gray- diffuse emittance  $\epsilon$ , and are spaced a distance  $L$  apart. Determine the radiative heat flux between the plates as well as its divergence.

# Solution

The radiative heat flux is determined from equation (14.47) with  $\tau = \kappa z$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q(\tau) = 2J_wE_3(\tau) - 2J_wE_3(\tau_L - \tau) + 2\sigma T_m^4\int_0^\tau E_2(\tau -\tau ')d\tau ' - 2\sigma T_m^4\int_\tau^{\tau_L}E_2(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau '}\\ {= 2J_wE_3(\tau) - 2J_wE_3(\tau_L - \tau) + 2\sigma T_m^4\left[E_3(\tau -\tau ')\right]_0 + E_3(\tau ' - \tau ')\left|_{\tau}^{\tau_L}\right]}\\ {= (J_w - \sigma T_m^4)2[E_3(\tau) - E_3(\tau_L - \tau)],} \end{array}
$$

where we have made use of the symmetry of the problem, i.e.,  $J_{1} = J_{2} = J_{w}$ , and  $\pi I_{bm} = \sigma T_m^4 =$  const. The necessary relationship between surface flux, temperature, and radiosity has been given by equation (14.48), or for the plane slab at  $\tau = 0$ ,

$$
q(0) = \frac{\epsilon}{1 - \epsilon} (\sigma T_w^4 -J_w) = (J_w - \sigma T_m^4)[1 - 2E_3(\tau_L)].
$$

Solving for  $J_{w}$ , we find

$$
J_{w} = \frac{\sigma T_{w}^{4} + (1 / \epsilon - 1)[1 - 2E_{3}(\tau_{L})]\sigma T_{m}^{4}}{1 + (1 / \epsilon - 1)[1 - 2E_{3}(\tau_{L})]},
$$

and

$$
\frac{q(\tau)}{\sigma(T_w^4 - T_m^4)} = \frac{2[E_3(\tau) - E_3(\tau_L - \tau)]}{1 + (1 / \epsilon - 1)[1 - 2E_3(\tau_L)]}.
$$

The divergence of the flux may be evaluated by first calculating the incident radiation from equation (14.55) and then using equation (14.36). While this method is preferable for numerical and/or multidimensional calculations, it is more convenient here simply to differentiate the above expression for the heat flux. Thus,

$$
\frac{dq}{d\tau} (\tau)\big / \sigma (T_w^4 -T_m^4) = -\frac{2[E_2(\tau) + E_2(\tau_L - \tau)]}{1 + (1 / \epsilon - 1)[1 - 2E_3(\tau_L)]}.
$$

If  $T_{w} > T_{m}$ , then  $dq / d\tau$  is always negative: The flux is positive at  $\tau = 0$  (going into the medium), zero at the midplane, and turning more and more negative as the  $\tau = \tau_{L}$  plate is approached.

# Medium at Radiative Equilibrium

We will again limit our discussion to a gray medium. Replacing  $\pi I_{bi} = n^2\sigma T_i^4$  by  $J_{i}$  in the nondimensionalized equations for radiative equilibrium, equations (14.41) and (14.42), and setting  $q_{1} = q_{2} = q =$  const transforms equation (14.45) into

$$
\frac{q}{J_1 - J_2} = \Psi_b = 1 - 2\int_0^{\tau_L}\Phi_b(\tau ')E_2(\tau ')d\tau ',
$$

and from equation (14.49)

$$
J_{1} - J_{2} = n^{2}\sigma (T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4}) - \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} +\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} -2\right)q.
$$

Thus,

$$
q = \Psi_{b}(J_{1} - J_{2}) = \Psi_{b}\left[n^{2}\sigma (T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4}) - \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} +\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} -2\right)q\right],
$$

or

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{n^2\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = \frac{\Psi_b}{1 + \Psi_b\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} + \frac{1}{\epsilon_2} - 2\right)}. \tag{14.50}
$$

Similarly, for the nondimensional temperature distribution one obtains

$$
\Phi (\tau) = \frac{T^4(\tau) - T_2^4}{T_1^4 - T_2^4} = \frac{\Phi_b(\tau) + \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_2} - 1\right)\Psi_b}{1 + \Psi_b\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} + \frac{1}{\epsilon_2} - 2\right)}. \tag{14.51}
$$

Example 14.2. A gray, nonscattering medium with refractive index  $n = 1$  and an absorption coefficient  $\kappa = 0.1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  is contained between two isothermal cylinders. The inner cylinder is hot  $(T_{1} = 2000\mathrm{K})$  and highly reflective  $(\epsilon_{1} = 0.1)$ ; the outer cylinder is a strong absorber  $(\alpha_{2} = \epsilon_{2} = 0.9)$ , and it must be kept relatively cool  $(T_{2}\leq 400\mathrm{K})$ . The gap between the two cylinders is  $25\mathrm{cm}$ . Assuming that conductive and convective heat transfer can be neglected as compared to radiation, and assuming that the cylinders have large diameters  $(D_{1} > 25\mathrm{cm})$ , determine the necessary cooling rate for the outer cylinder to avoid overheating.

# Solution

Since the thickness of the medium is small as compared with the diameters of the cylinders, we may model the gap as a one- dimensional plane- parallel slab of optical thickness  $\tau_{\mathrm{L}} = 0.1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}\times 25\mathrm{cm} = 2.5$ . Thus, from Table 14.1  $\Psi_{b} = 0.3401$  and from equation (14.50)

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = \frac{0.3401}{1 + 0.3401\left(\frac{1}{0.1} + \frac{1}{0.9} - 2\right)} = 0.0830,
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}{q_{\mathrm{min}}} & = & {\Psi_{\sigma}\left(T_1^4 -T_2^4,\mathrm{max}\right)}\\ {} & = & {0.0830\times 5.670\times 10^{-12}(2000^4 -400^4)\mathrm{W / cm}^2 = 7.52\mathrm{W / cm}^2.} \end{array}
$$

# 14.4 PLANE LAYER OF A SCATTERING MEDIUM

# Isotropic Scattering

For isotropic scattering the source function is found from equation (14.5) as

$$
S(\tau) = (1 - \omega)I_b(\tau) + \frac{\omega}{4\pi} G(\tau), \tag{14.52}
$$

and the  $I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})$  in equations (14.46) and (14.47) must be replaced by  $S(\tau^{\prime})$

$$
\begin{array}{l}{G(\tau) = 2J_1E_2(\tau) + 2J_2E_2(\tau_{\mathrm{L}} - \tau) + 2\pi \int_0^\tau S(\tau ')E_1(\tau -\tau ')d\tau ' + 2\pi \int_\tau^\tau S(\tau ')E_1(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau ',}\\ {q(\tau) = 2J_1E_3(\tau) - 2J_2E_3(\tau_{\mathrm{L}} - \tau) + 2\pi \int_0^\tau S(\tau ')E_2(\tau -\tau ')d\tau ' - 2\pi \int_\tau^\tau S(\tau ')E_2(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau '.} \end{array} \tag{14.54}
$$

# Medium with Specified Temperature Field

In the presence of isotropic scattering equation (14.53) becomes an integral equation for the unknown  $G(\tau)$ . Defining a general nondimensional function similar to equation (14.41),

$$
\Phi (\tau) = \frac{\pi S(\tau) - J_2}{J_1 - J_2}, \tag{14.55}
$$

equation (14.53) may be simplified to

$$
\Phi (\tau) = (1 - \omega)\frac{\pi I_b(\tau) - J_2}{J_1 - J_2} +\frac{\omega}{2}\bigg[E_2(\tau) + \int_0^{\tau_L}\Phi (\tau)E_1(\tau ') - \tau |)d\tau '\bigg]. \tag{14.56}
$$

Equation (14.56) reduces to equation (14.43) for the case of  $\omega \rightarrow 1$  (purely scattering medium). For such a medium thermal radiation is decoupled from the temperature field (since there is no emission), and radiative equilibrium prevails regardless of the temperature distribution. This behavior is also seen from equation (14.24), which states that  $dq / d\tau = 0$  if  $\omega = 1$ , regardless of  $I_{b}(\tau)$ .

Similarly, equation (14.54) may be nondimensionalized as

$$
\Psi (\tau) = \frac{q(\tau)}{J_1 - J_2} = 2\bigg[E_b(\tau) + \int_0^\tau \Phi (\tau ')E_2(\tau -\tau ')d\tau ' - \int_\tau^{\tau_L}\Phi (\tau ')E_2(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau '\bigg]. \tag{14.57}
$$

Once a solution for  $\Phi (\tau)$  has been obtained, the radiative flux is determined from equation (14.57), and incident radiation and radiative source term are found through equation (14.55).

# Medium at Radiative Equilibrium

In the case of radiative equilibrium in a gray medium (and assuming no internal heat generation takes place) equation (14.26) further simplifies the source function to

$$
S(\tau) = (1 - \omega)I_b(\tau) + \frac{\omega}{4\pi} G(\tau) = I_b(\tau). \tag{14.58}
$$

Thus all relations developed in the previous section on radiative equilibrium are equally valid for isotropically scattering media with optical thickness  $\begin{array}{r}\tau = \int_0^\tau \beta dz \end{array}$  based on the extinction coefficient rather than the absorption coefficient. For a gray medium at radiative equilibrium there is no distinction between absorption and isotropic scattering: Any energy absorbed at  $\tau$  must be reemitted isotropically at the same location, although at different wavelengths; any isotropically scattered energy is simply redirected isotropically (without change of wavelength). Since a gray medium is "colorblind" it cannot distinguish between emission and isotropic scattering. However, for the purely scattering case,  $\omega \rightarrow 1$  there is no emission and, therefore,  $I_{b}$  no longer enters the calculations. For this extreme case the  $T^4 (\tau)$  in equations (14.41) and (14.51) should be replaced by  $G(\tau) / 4n^2\sigma$

# Anisotropic Scattering

For demonstrative purposes we will only consider the case of a gray slab at radiative equilibrium with linear- anisotropic scattering. The source function is then given by equation (14.15), which reduces to

$$
S(\tau ,\mu) = I_b(\tau) + \frac{A_1\omega}{4\pi} q\mu . \tag{14.59}
$$

Therefore, equations (14.21) and (14.22) become

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\frac{G(\tau)}{4\pi} = I_b(\tau) = \frac{J_1}{2\pi} E_2(\tau) + \frac{J_2}{2\pi} E_2(\tau_L - \tau) + \frac{1}{2}\int_0^\tau I_b(\tau ')E_1(\tau -\tau ')d\tau '}\\ {+\frac{1}{2}\int_\tau^{\tau_L}I_b(\tau ')E_1(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau ' + \frac{A_1\omega}{8\pi} q[E_3(\tau_L - \tau) - E_3(\tau)],}\\ {q(\tau) = q = 2J_1E_3(\tau) - 2J_2E_3(\tau_L - \tau) + 2\pi \bigg[\int_0^\tau I_b(\tau ')E_2(\tau -\tau ')d\tau '}\\ {-\int_\tau^{\tau_L}I_b(\tau ')E_2(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau ' + \frac{A_1\omega}{2} q\bigg[\frac{2}{3} -E_4(\tau) - E_4(\tau_L - \tau)\bigg].} \end{array} \tag{14.61}
$$

$$

The problem of radiative equilibrium in a one- dimensional, plane- parallel, anisotropically scattering medium has been solved by Modest and Azad [3]. They considered full Mie- anisotropic scattering for a number of particulate clouds, whose relevant parameters have been given in Chapter 12, Table 12.1. Figure 14- 4 shows representative results for radiative heat fluxes and temperature distributions in Clouds 1 and 2. Also included are results for linear- anisotropic scattering (approximating the phase functions as indicated in Fig. 12- 6), using the exact relations, equations (14.62) and (14.63), as well as the differential approximation (to be discussed in the following two chapters). It was observed that approximating a complicated phase function by a linear- anisotropic one (after removing forward- and backward- scattering peaks) always leads to accurate results for heat transfer applications.

# 14.5 RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN SPHERICAL MEDIA

In a plane- parallel medium, if the temperature field (as well as any radiative property) varies only in the direction normal to the plates, the problem is one- dimensional. If the polar angle

![](images/d6f02e368859dfd9578b52a2657c7daaea1906cbb6db58610cb754729cd4a11b.jpg)  
FIGURE 14-5 Coordinates for a one-dimensional spherical medium.

$\theta$  is measured from the direction normal to the plates, the radiative intensity depends only on the spatial coordinate  $z$  and polar angle  $\theta$  (but not on azimuthal angle  $\psi$ , because of symmetry). A similar situation exists in a one- dimensional spherical medium. Let the temperature field vary only in the radial direction  $r$ , but not with polar angle  $\theta_{s}$  or azimuthal angle  $\psi_{s}$  (where the subscripts  $s$  have been added to emphasize that these angles specify position in a spherical coordinate system, and are independent of angles  $\theta$  and  $\psi$ , which are employed to describe direction). If the polar direction angle  $\theta$  is measured from the radial position vector as shown in Fig. 14- 5, then the radiative intensity depends only on polar angle  $\theta$  and—owing to symmetry—not on azimuthal angle  $\psi$ . However, unlike in the plane layer of Fig. 14- 1, in spherical symmetry the polar angle changes as a beam travels in the direction of  $\S$  through the medium (with  $\theta$  steadily decreasing with increasing path length  $s$ ). Therefore, with intensity depending on radial location  $r$  and direction angle  $\theta$ , the left- hand side of equation (14.1) must be expressed<sup>5</sup> as

$$
\mathfrak{s}\cdot \nabla I = \frac{dI}{ds} = \frac{\partial I}{\partial r}\frac{dr}{ds} +\frac{\partial I}{\partial\theta}\frac{d\theta}{ds}. \tag{14.64}
$$

From inspection of Fig. 14- 5, we find that  $\cos \theta = dr / ds$ . Also, from the law of sines,

$$
\frac{\sin\theta}{r^{\prime}d\theta_{s}} = \frac{\sin\theta^{\prime}}{r d\theta_{s}}\quad \mathrm{or}\quad r\sin \theta = r^{\prime}\sin \theta^{\prime} = \mathrm{const} \tag{14.65}
$$

along  $s$ . Differentiating this relation gives

$$
dr\sin \theta +r\cos \theta d\theta = 0,\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \frac{d\theta}{dr} = -\frac{\tan\theta}{r}. \tag{14.66}
$$

Substituting both relations into equation (14.64) leads to

$$
\frac{dI}{ds} = \cos \theta \frac{\partial I}{\partial r} (r,\theta) - \frac{\sin\theta}{r}\frac{\partial I}{\partial\theta} (r,\theta), \tag{14.67}
$$

or, if the shorthand  $\mu = \cos \theta$  is preferred,

$$
\frac{dI}{ds} = \mu \frac{\partial I}{\partial r} (r,\mu) + \frac{1 - \mu^2}{r}\frac{\partial I}{\partial\mu} (r,\mu), \tag{14.68}
$$

where we have used  $d\mu = - \sin \theta d\theta$ . Substituting equation (14.68) into equations (14.1) and (14.3), we obtain, with  $\tau = \int_0^r\beta dr$ ,

$$
\mu \frac{\partial I}{\partial\tau} (\tau ,\mu) + \frac{1 - \mu^2}{\tau}\frac{\partial I}{\partial\mu} (\tau ,\mu) = S(\tau ,\mu) - I(\tau ,\mu), \tag{14.69}
$$

where the radiative source for linear- anisotropic scattering has been given by equation (14.15).

The problem of one- dimensional heat transfer through a spherical medium was first considered by Sparrow and coworkers [4], who investigated radiative equilibrium in a gray nonscattering medium contained between concentric black spheres. They assumed that there was uniform heat generation within the medium and that both surfaces had identical and constant temperatures. Ryhming [5] considered the same problem, but without heat generation and with the two surfaces at different temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ . The condition of black walls was relaxed by Viskanta and Crosbie [6], who considered a nonscattering, gray, heat- generating medium between two gray, isothermal spheres of radius  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$ , respectively (and at temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , and with gray diffuse emittances  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$ ). They found that the temperature field, in terms of emissive power  $E_{b}$ , may be calculated from

$$
E_{b}(\tau) = J_{1} + (J_{2} - J_{1})\Phi (\tau) + \frac{\dot{Q}^{\prime\prime\prime}}{\kappa}\Phi_{s}(\tau). \tag{14.70}
$$

Here  $J_{1}$  and  $J_{2}$  are the radiosities of the two spherical surfaces, and  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}$  is the (uniform) heat generation within the medium.  $\Phi (\tau)$  is the nondimensional emissive power for a medium without heat generation, determined from

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\Phi (\tau) = \frac{E_b(\tau) - J_1}{J_2 - J_1} = \frac{1}{2\tau}\left[g(\tau) + \int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2}K(\tau ,t)\Phi (t)dt\right],}\\ {g(\tau) = \tau_2E_2(\tau_2 - \tau) - \sqrt{\tau_2^2 - \tau_1^2} E_2\left(\sqrt{\tau_2^2 - \tau_1^2} +\sqrt{\tau^2 - \tau_1^2}\right)}\\ {+E_3(\tau_2 - \tau) - E_3\left(\sqrt{\tau_2^2 - \tau_1^2} +\sqrt{\tau^2 - \tau_1^2}\right),}\\ {K(\tau ,t) = \left[E_1(|\tau -t|) - E_1\left(\sqrt{\tau_2^2 - \tau_1^2} +\sqrt{\tau^2 - \tau_1^2}\right)\right]t.} \end{array} \tag{14.73}
$$

$\Phi_{s}(\tau)$  is the nondimensional emissive power for a medium with uniform heat generation, but with both surfaces having the same radiosity,  $J_{1}$ , obtained from

$$
\Phi_{s}(\tau) = \frac{E_{b} - J_{1}}{\dot{Q}^{\prime\prime\prime} / \kappa} = \frac{1}{4} +\frac{1}{2\tau}\int_{\tau_{1}}^{\tau_{2}}K(\tau ,t)\Phi_{s}(t)dt. \tag{14.74}
$$

Once the functions  $\Phi (\tau)$  and/or  $\Phi_{s}(\tau)$  have been determined, the radiative heat fluxes can be calculated from

$$
\tau^2 g(\tau) = (J_1 - J_2)\tau_1^2\Psi (\tau) + \frac{\dot{Q}^{\prime\prime\prime}}{\kappa}\left[\frac{\tau^3}{3} -\tau_1^2\Psi_s(\tau)\right], \tag{14.75}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{l}\Psi (\tau) = \frac{2}{\tau_1^2}\left[h(\tau) + \int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2}H(\tau ,t)\Phi (t)dt\right],\\ \displaystyle \Psi_s(\tau) = \frac{1}{\tau_1^2}\left[\frac{\tau^3}{3} -2\int_{\tau_1}^{\tau_2}H(\tau ,t)\Phi_s(t)dt\right], \end{array} \tag{14.76}

where  $\operatorname {sgn}(t) = t / |t| = \pm 1,$  depending on the sign of  $t$  . Solutions to  $\Phi ,\Psi ,\Phi_{s},$  and  $\Psi_{s}$  have been tabulated by Viskanta and Crosbie [6] for a number of radius ratios  $R_{1} / R_{2}$  and optical thicknesses  $\tau_{2}$  . Their results for the nondimensional flux functions  $\Psi$  and  $\Psi_{s}$  are given in Table 14.2. As for the plane slab, the statement of radiative equilibrium,

$$
\frac{1}{\tau^2}\frac{d}{d\tau} (\tau^2 q) = \frac{\dot{Q}'''}{\kappa}, \tag{14.80}
$$

implies that  $\Psi$  and  $\Psi_{s}$  are constants, and equations (14.76) and (14.77) may be evaluated for any arbitrary value of  $\tau$

It remains to eliminate the radiosities  $J_{1}$  and  $J_{2}$  from equation (14.75) for the case of nonblack boundaries. Similar to the development for parallel plates, equations (14.48) through (14.50), we have

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}\tau = \tau_1: & & q_1 = \frac{\epsilon_1}{1 - \epsilon_1}\left(n^2\sigma T_1^4 -J_1\right),\\ \tau = \tau_2: & & -q_2 = \frac{\epsilon_2}{1 - \epsilon_2}\left(n^2\sigma T_2^4 -J_2\right). \end{array} \tag{14.81b}
$$

Performing an energy balance (i.e., stating that energy coming in at Sphere 1, plus energy generated in the volume between spheres, equals energy going out at Sphere 2), we obtain

$$
4\pi R_1^2 q_1 + \dot{Q}'''\frac{4}{3}\pi (R_2^3 -R_1^3) = 4\pi R_2^2 q_2,
$$

or

$$

$$

Substituting equation (14.82) into (14.81) leads to

$$
\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} -1\right)q_1 + \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_2} -1\right)\left[\left(\frac{\tau_1}{\tau_2}\right)^2 q_1 + \frac{1}{3}\frac{\dot{Q}'''}{\kappa}\frac{\tau_2^3 - \tau_1^3}{\tau_2^2}\right] = n^2\sigma (T_1^4 -T_2^4) - (J_1 - J_2),
$$

or

$$

$$

which may be employed to eliminate the radiosities from equation (14.75).

More recently, a few investigators have considered somewhat more involved situations. The governing integral equations for an isotropically scattering spherical medium were first stated by Pomraning and Siewert [7]. These equations were used by Thynell and Özisik [8] to investigate the gray isotropically scattering solid sphere with gray, diffusely reflecting boundary. Their analysis applied to any given temperature fields or variable internal heat generation. Finally, the problem of nondiffuse reflectance at the outer face, obeying Fresnel's laws, was investigated by Wu and Wang [9] for an isothermal, isotropically scattering, solid sphere.

Example 14.3. A gray, nonscattering medium with refractive index  $n = 1$  and an absorption coefficient  $\kappa = 0.1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  is contained between two concentric isothermal spheres with radii  $R_{1} = 25\mathrm{cm}$  and  $R_{2} = 50\mathrm{cm}$ . The inner sphere is hot  $(T_{1} = 2000\mathrm{K})$  and highly reflective  $(\epsilon_{1} = 0.1)$ ; the outer sphere is a strong absorber  $(\alpha_{2} = \epsilon_{2} = 0.9)$ , which must be kept relatively cool  $(T_{2} = 400\mathrm{K})$ . Assuming that conductive and convective heat transfer can be neglected as compared with radiation, determine the necessary cooling rate.

# Solution

We have the situation of one- dimensional radiative equilibrium between concentric spheres, and equation (14.75) applies with  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} = 0$ . With  $R_{1} / R_{2} = 25 / 50 = 0.5$  and  $\tau_{2} = \kappa R_{2} = 0.1\times 50 = 5$  we obtain, from Table 14.2,  $\Psi = 0.5797$ . The radiosities are eliminated with equation (14.83) so that

$$
\tau^2 q = \sigma (T_1^4 -T_2^4)\tau_1^2\Psi -\left[\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} -1 + \left(\frac{\tau_1}{\tau_2}\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_2} -1\right)\right]\tau_1^2 q\Psi ,
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{r}\frac{\tau_1^2q}{\tau_1^2\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = \frac{q_1}{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = \frac{\Psi}{1 + \left[\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} - 1 + \left(\frac{\tau_1}{\tau_2}\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_2} - 1\right)\right]\Psi}\\ = \frac{0.5797}{1 + \left[\frac{1}{0.1} - 1 + 0.5^2\left(\frac{1}{0.9} - 1\right)\right]0.5797} = 0.0930. \end{array}
$$

This result should be compared with the value of 0.0830 found in Example 14.2 for the identical situation between parallel plates. The flux density at the inner sphere then turns out to be

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q_1 = 0.0930\sigma (T_1^4 -T_2^4)}\\ {= 0.0930\times 5.670\times 10^{-12}(2000^4 -400^4)\mathrm{W / cm}^2 = 8.42\mathrm{W / cm}^2.} \end{array}
$$

# 14.6 RADIATIVE TRANSFER IN CYLINDRICAL MEDIA

We shall now briefly consider the case of a one- dimensional cylindrical medium, with temperature and radiative properties varying only in the radial direction  $r$ , but not with axial position  $z$  or azimuthal angle  $\psi_{c}$  (where we have again added the subscript  $c$  to emphasize that this angle specifies position in the cylindrical coordinate system, and is independent of azimuthal direction angle  $\psi$ ). For this geometry it is advantageous to place the direction coordinate system such that polar angle  $\theta$  is measured from the positive  $z$ - axis, while the azimuthal angle  $\psi$  is measured in the  $r$ -  $\psi_{c}$ - plane perpendicular to it, as shown in Fig. 14- 6. Measuring the azimuthal angle from the radial coordinate as indicated in the figure, we recognize that radiative intensity may vary with radial position  $r$  and both direction angles  $\theta$  and  $\psi$ . Therefore, similar to equation (14.64), we have

$$

$$

From symmetry, it follows that  $I(r,\theta ,\psi) = I(r,\theta , - \psi) = I(r,\pi - \theta ,\psi)$ . Inspecting Fig. 14- 6, we find

$$
\cos \psi = \frac{dr}{ds\sin\theta},\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \frac{dr}{ds} = \sin \theta \cos \psi , \tag{14.85}

FIGURE 14-6 Coordinates for a one-dimensional cylindrical medium.

where  $ds\sin \theta$  is the projection of  $ds$  into the  $r - \psi_c$ - plane. Traveling along a beam in the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  we see that, similar to the spherical case, the azimuthal angle  $\psi$  steadily decreases (instead of  $\theta$  in the spherical case, see Fig. 14- 5). Therefore, replacing  $\theta$  by  $\psi$  in equation (14.66), we find

$$
\frac{d\psi}{dr} = -\frac{\tan\psi}{r},\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \frac{d\psi}{ds} = \frac{d\psi}{dr}\frac{dr}{ds} = -\frac{\sin\theta\sin\psi}{r}. \tag{14.86}
$$

On the other hand, traveling along  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , we see that the angle with the  $\mathbf{z}$ - axis remains unchanged, or  $d\theta /ds = 0$ . Sticking these relations into equation (14.84) yields

$$
\frac{dI}{ds} = \sin \theta \left[\cos \psi \frac{\partial I}{\partial r} (r,\theta ,\psi) - \frac{\sin\psi}{r}\frac{\partial I}{\partial\psi} (r,\theta ,\psi)\right]. \tag{14.87}
$$

The equation of transfer appropriate for the one- dimensional cylindrical medium follows then from equations (14.1) and (14.3) as

$$
\sin \theta \left[\cos \psi \frac{\partial I}{\partial\tau} (\tau ,\theta ,\psi) - \frac{\sin\psi}{\tau}\frac{\partial I}{\partial\psi} (\tau ,\theta ,\psi)\right] = S(\tau ,\theta ,\psi) - I(\tau ,\theta ,\psi), \tag{14.88}
$$

where again  $\tau = \int_0^r\beta dr$ . This relationship can also be found from the left- hand side of equation (14.84) by recognizing (cf. Fig. 14- 6) that

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \sin \theta \cos \psi \hat{\mathbf{e}}_r + \sin \theta \sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\psi_c} + \cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{e}}_z,}\\ {\psi +\psi_c = \mathrm{const~along~}\hat{\mathbf{s}},} \end{array} \tag{14.89b}
$$

and using, for cylindrical coordinates,

$$
\nabla = \frac{\partial}{\partial r}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_r + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial\psi_c}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\psi_c} + \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_z,
$$

with  $d\psi_{c} = - d\psi$  and  $\partial I / \partial z = 0$ . The general form for the radiative source function is given by equation (14.3); for linear- anisotropic scattering, equation (14.15) remains valid with  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_r\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} = \cos \theta$  (valid for slab and sphere, cf. Figs. 14- 1 and 14- 5) replaced by  $\hat{\mathbf{e}}_r\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} = \sin \theta \cos \psi$  (valid for the cylinder, cf. Fig. 14- 6), or

$$
S(\tau ,\theta ,\psi) = (1 - \omega)I_b(\tau) + \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\left[G(\tau) + A_1q(\tau)\sin \theta \cos \psi \right]. \tag{14.90}

The problem of one- dimensional heat transfer through a cylindrical medium was first considered by Heaslet and Warming [10]. They investigated the case of an isotropically scattering medium contained within an isothermal black cylindrical container. Two cases were treated:  $(i)$  radiative equilibrium with uniform heat generation within the medium, and  $(ii)$  an isothermal medium. While they displayed a few graphical results, no tabulated results were given.

The solution for a one- dimensional, gray, linear- anisotropically scattering cylinder with arbitrary, but specified, temperature distribution has been given by Azad and Modest [11], using a different approach. We list here their solution for the simple case of no scattering  $(\omega = 0)$  , for which

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q(\tau) = \left[n^{2}\sigma T^{4}(\tau_{R}) - J_{w}\right]F(\tau ,\tau_{R})}\\ {-\int_{0}^{\tau}\frac{d}{d\tau^{\prime}} (n^{2}\sigma T^{4})\frac{\tau^{\prime}}{\tau} F(\tau^{\prime},\tau)d\tau^{\prime} - \int_{\tau}^{\tau_{R}}\frac{d}{d\tau^{\prime}} (n^{2}\sigma T^{4})F(\tau ,\tau^{\prime})d\tau ,} \end{array} \tag{14.91}
$$

with

$$
F(\tau ,\tau^{\prime}) = -\frac{4}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi /2}\exp \left[-\frac{\tau}{\sin\theta}\left(\cos \psi +\sqrt{\left(\frac{\tau^{\prime}}{\tau}\right)^{2} - \sin^{2}\psi}\right)\right]\sin^{2}\theta \cos \psi d\theta d\psi . \tag{14.92}
$$

Equation (14.91) is very similar to the equivalent expression for the one- dimensional slab, equation (14.39) (after integration by parts): Instead of the relatively simple (and widely tabulated) exponential integral  $E_{3}(\tau^{\prime} - \tau)$  we have another, somewhat more complicated geometric function,  $F(\tau ,\tau^{\prime})$  . For an isothermal cylinder equation (14.91) may be evaluated in explicit form at  $\tau = \tau_{R},$  with  $F(\tau_{R},\tau_{R})$  expressed in terms of modified Bessel functions. Some representative results of equation (14.91) for  $\tau = \tau_{R}$  have been tabulated in Table 14.3.

Thermal radiation between concentric cylinders was first treated by Kesten [12], who considered a nonscattering, gray gas with known temperature distribution. The case of a gray, isotropically scattering medium at radiative equilibrium between concentric cylinders has been studied by Pandey and Cogley [13] and Loyalka [14]. The governing equations become rather involved and will not be reproduced here. Because of this complexity, both solutions are not quite exact: Pandey and Cogley used some approximate geometric functions, while Loyalka used a simple variational approach to solve the governing integral equation. Comparison with the "exact" Monte Carlo solution by Perlmutter and Howell [15] shows that Loyalka's results may essentially be taken as exact. Some representative results for the nondimensional radiative

For nonblack walls the radiosities may be eliminated from equation (14.93) in precisely the same fashion as was done for concentric spheres. From equation (14.83), with  $A_{1} / A_{2} = R_{1} / R_{2} = \tau_{1} / \tau_{2}$  and  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} = 0$ ,

$$

and

$$
\frac{q_1}{n^2\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = \frac{\Psi}{1 + \left[\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} - 1 + \frac{\tau_1}{\tau_2}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_2} - 1\right)\right]\Psi}. \tag{14.94}
$$

Example 14.4. Repeat Example 14.3 for the case of concentric cylinders.

# Solution

With  $\tau_{2} = 5$  and  $\tau_{1} = 2.5$  we have  $\tau_{2} - \tau_{1} = 2.5$  and, after interpolating (somewhat nonlinearly) between values from Table 14.4 for  $\tau_{2} - \tau_{1} = 2.0$  and  $\tau_{2} - \tau_{1} = 3.0$ ,  $\Psi \simeq 0.48$ . Thus,

$$
\frac{q_1}{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = \frac{0.48}{1 + \left[\frac{1}{0.1} - 1 + 0.5\left(\frac{1}{0.9} - 1\right)\right]0.48} = 0.0898,
$$

and

$$
q_{1} = 0.0898\times 5.670\times 10^{-12}(2000^{4} - 400^{4}) = 8.13W / \mathrm{cm}^{2}.
$$

We observe that, for identical conditions, the heat loss is greatest between concentric spheres, followed by concentric cylinders, and finally by parallel plates. Also, from Tables 14.2 and 14.4 we see that heat loss increases with decreasing radius ratio  $R_{1} / R_{2}$ . This observation may be explained by the fact that, per unit area, the surface of an (inner) sphere exchanges heat with a larger area on the (outer) sphere  $(A_{2} / A_{1} = R_{2}^{2} / R_{1}^{2})$  than is the case for concentric cylinders  $(A_{2} / A_{1} = R_{2} / R_{1})$  or parallel plates  $(A_{2} / A_{1} = 1)$ . The same argument applies to decreasing radius ratios.

# 14.7 NUMERICAL SOLUTION OF THE GOVERNING INTEGRAL EQUATIONS

The governing integral equations may be solved with several analytical and/or numerical techniques, which will not be discussed in this text in any detail.

An example of analytical techniques is the use of Chandrasekhar's  $X-$  and Y- functions, based on the principle of invariance, which is described in some detail in Chandrasekhar's book [16]. For example, Heaslet and Warming [2] expressed the nondimensional temperature  $\Phi_b$  in equation (14.43) in terms of moments of these  $X-$  and  $Y$  - functions. The moments are determined by numerical quadrature, using tabulated values for Chandrasekhar's  $X-$  and  $Y$  - functions. Case's normal- mode expansion technique [17, 18] is to linear integral equations what separationof- variables is to partial differential equations. The technique was originally developed for neutron transport theory, and has been applied to radiative heat transfer by Ferziger and Simmons [19, 20] and Siewert and Ozisik [21- 27]. A detailed account may be found in the book by Ozisik [28]. Siewert and coworkers [29,30] have further developed Case's normal- mode approach, by finding solutions in terms of power series. This approach, known as the  $F_{N}$  - method, was also originally applied to neutron transport, and only later to thermal radiation [31].

Numerical solutions to the governing integral equations may be found by a variety of methods. The simplest such method is the standard numerical quadrature as discussed in Section 5.6. Since integrands often contain singularities [cf. equation (14.43)], these must be removed before quadrature can be applied [2]. The problem of singularities may also be overcome by approximating the unknown variable in functional form, which allows the analytical evaluation of such integrals. For example, Ozisik and coworkers [32- 35] solved the governing integral equation for several plane- parallel problems with the Galerkin method [36]. In this method, the unknown dependent variable [say,  $\Phi (\tau)$  in equation (14.43)] is approximated by a series of independent functions  $\phi_{i}(\tau)$  , that is,

$$
\Phi (\tau) = C_1\phi_1(\tau) + C_2\phi_2(\tau) + \dots = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}C_i\phi_i(\tau), \tag{14.95}
$$

where the  $C_i$  are unknown constants. These are determined by multiplying the governing equation by each of the functions  $\phi_{i}(\tau)$  , followed by integration over the entire domain, resulting in  $N$  simultaneous algebraic equations for the unknown constants. Most often the independent functions in equation (14.95) are chosen to be powers in the independent variable, for example,  $\phi_{i}(\tau) = \tau^{i - 1}$ $(i = 1,2,\ldots)$  , although Legendre polynomials have also been used [37], in order to exploit the orthogonality properties of such polynomials. The Galerkin method offers results of great accuracy even for series truncated after very few terms, albeit at the price of very tedious analytical or numerical integrations. For more general geometries the use of the related finite element method becomes more practical, as applied by Reddy and Murty [38].

A somewhat simpler method is the point collocation method together with approximating the unknown variable by piecewise- continuous splines. In this method the unknown dependent variable, say  $\Phi (\tau)$  , is approximated by a spline function involving  $N + 1$  nodal values  $\Phi_i =$ $\Phi (\tau_i),i = 0,1,2,\ldots ,N$  For example, if standard cubic splines are employed [39],

$$
\begin{array}{r}\Phi = \Phi_i + B_i(\tau -\tau_i) + C_i(\tau -\tau_i)^2 +D_i(\tau -\tau_i)^3,\\ \tau_i\leq \tau \leq \tau_{i + 1},i = 0,1,\ldots ,N - 1, \end{array} \tag{14.96}
$$

where the constants  $B_{i},C_{i},$  and  $D_{i}$  depend on all values of  $\Phi_i$  and are readily found through standard software packages resident on most computers. More sophisticated splines, such as  $B$  - splines [40- 42] or Chebyshev polynomials [43], result in more complicated expressions. Equation (14.96) is now substituted into the governing integral equation, and the piecewise integrals are evaluated analytically. Applying the governing equation to the  $N + 1$  nodal points (point collocation) results in  $N + 1$  simultaneous, linear algebraic equations for the unknown  $\Phi_i$

# Problems

14.1 The gap between two parallel black plates at  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , respectively, is filled with a particle- laden gas. Radiative equilibrium prevails, and the particle loading is a fixed volume fraction, with particles manufactured from two different materials (one a specular reflector, the other a diffuse reflector, both having the same  $\epsilon$ ). Sketch the nondimensional heat flux  $\Psi = q / \sigma (T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4})$  vs. particle size (but keeping volume fraction constant).

14.2 Consider radiative equilibrium in a one- dimensional, gray, nonscattering, plane- parallel medium bounded by isothermal black plates at temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ . To make a simple closed- form solution possible for the determination of the heat flux between the plates, it has been proposed to replace the radiative- equilibrium slab by a constant temperature slab, with its temperature evaluated at  $T_{\mathrm{av}}^{4} = \frac{1}{2} (T_{1}^{4} + T_{2}^{4})$ . Under what optical conditions is this a good idea, if ever?

To determine this compare the different "exact" solutions for various optical thicknesses, say,  $\tau_{L} = 0$ , 1, 5.

14.3 Consider a space enclosed by infinite, diffuse- gray parallel plates filled with a gray nonscattering medium. The surfaces are isothermal (both at  $T_{w}$ ), and there is uniform and constant heat generation within the medium per unit volume,  $\hat{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}$ . Conduction and convection are negligible so that  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = \hat{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}$ . Set up the integral equations describing temperature and heat flux distribution in the enclosure, i.e., show that

$$
\begin{array}{l}\Phi (\tau) = \frac{\sigma T^4 - J_w}{\hat{Q}^{\prime\prime\prime} / 4\kappa} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\tau_L}\Phi (\tau ')E_1(|\tau -\tau '|)d\tau ',\\ \displaystyle \Psi (\tau) = \frac{q}{\hat{Q}^{\prime\prime\prime} / \kappa} = \tau -\frac{\tau_L}{2}. \end{array}
$$

14.4 A semi- infinite, gray, isotropically scattering medium, originally at a temperature of  $0\mathrm{K}$ , is subjected to collimated irradiation with a constant heat flux  $q_{0}$  normal to its nonreflecting surface. Set up the integral relationships governing steady- state temperature and radiative heat flux within the medium,

assuming radiative equilibrium. Hint: Collimated irradiation with heat flux  $q_{0}$  has the radiative intensity

$$
I_{0}(\theta ,\psi) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{q_{0}}{2\pi\sin\theta\delta\theta^{\prime}}, & 0\leq \theta < \delta \theta ,0\leq \psi \leq 2\pi ,\\ 0, & \mathrm{elsewhere.} \end{array} \right.
$$

14.5 Two large, isothermal gray plates at  $T_{1} = 2000\mathrm{K}$ ,  $T_{2} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  with  $\epsilon = \epsilon_{1} = \epsilon_{2} = 0.5$  are separated by a gap of width  $L = 1\mathrm{m}$  filled with purely (isotropically) scattering particles. If the heat flux between the plates has been measured as  $223.3\mathrm{kW} / \mathrm{m}^2$ , what is the medium's scattering coefficient?

14.6 Consider two parallel, black, isothermal plates spaced  $1\mathrm{m}$  apart with  $T_{1} = 2000\mathrm{K}$  and  $T_{2} = 1000\mathrm{K}$ . The medium between the plates is gray and at radiative equilibrium with a nonconstant absorption coefficient of

$$
\kappa = \kappa_{0} + \kappa_{1}^{\prime}z;\quad \kappa_{0} = 10^{-2}\mathrm{cm}^{-1},\quad \kappa_{1}^{\prime} = 2\times 10^{-4}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}.
$$

The medium does not scatter.

(a) What is the heat flux between the plates?  
(b) What is the temperature at the medium's center  $(z = \frac{1}{2} L)$ ?

14.7 An infinite, black, isothermal plate bounds a semi- infinite space filled with black spheres. At any given distance,  $z$ , away from the plate the particle number density is identical, namely  $N_{T} = 6.3662\times 10^{8}\mathrm{m}^{- 3}$ . However, the radius of the suspended spheres diminishes monotonically away from the surface as

$$
a = a_0e^{-z / L};\quad a_0 = 10^{-4}\mathrm{m},\quad L = 1\mathrm{m}.
$$

(a) Determine the absorption coefficient as a function of  $z$  (you may make the large-particle assumption).  
(b) Determine the optical coordinate as a function of  $z$ . What is the total optical thickness of the semi-infinite space?  
(c) Assuming that radiative equilibrium prevails, determine the heat loss from the plate.

14.8 The radiative heat transfer between two isothermal, black plates at temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$  and separated by a nonparticipating gas is to be minimized. Enough of a black material is available to place a  $1\mathrm{mm}$  thick radiation shield between the plates. Alternatively, the same amount of material could be used in the form of small spheres of  $0.1\mathrm{mm}$  radius to be suspended between the plates. Which possibility results in lower heat flux, assuming conduction and convection to be negligible?

14.9 Two infinite, isothermal plates at temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$  are separated by a cold, gray medium of optical thickness  $\tau_{L} = \kappa_{L}$  (no scattering).

(a) Calculate the radiative heat flux at the bottom plate and the top plate, and the net radiative energy going into the gray medium, assuming that both plates are black.  
(b) Repeat 
(a), but assume that both plates have the same temperature  $T$ , and that both plates are gray with equal emittance  $\epsilon$  (diffuse emission and reflection).

14.10 A semi- infinite, absorbing- emitting, nonscattering medium at uniform temperature is in contact with a gray- diffuse wall at  $T_{\mathrm{g}}$  and with emittance  $\epsilon_{w}$ .

(a) The medium is gray, and has a constant absorption coefficient. Determine the net radiative heat flux at the wall.  
(b) Let the medium be nongray with nonconstant absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{\lambda}$ , and the wall be nongray and nondiffuse with spectral, directional emittance  $\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}$ . How would this affect the wall heat flux?

14.11 A  $1\mathrm{m}$  thick, isothermal slab bounded by two cold black plates has a temperature of  $3000\mathrm{K}$ , and a nongray absorption coefficient that can be approximated by

$$
\kappa_{\lambda} = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}0, & \lambda < 2\mu \mathrm{m},\\ 0.20\mathrm{cm}^{-1}, & \lambda >2\mu \mathrm{m}. \end{array} \right.
$$

Calculate the total heat loss by radiation from the slab (in  $\mathrm{W / cm}^2$ ).

14.12 Consider  $(a)$  two parallel plates,  $(b)$  two concentric spheres, and  $(c)$  two concentric cylinders. The bottom/inner surface needs to dissipate a heat flux of  $30\mathrm{W / cm^2}$  and has a gray- diffuse emittance  $\epsilon_{1} = 0.5$ . The top/outer surface is at  $T_{2} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  with  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.8$ . The medium in between the surfaces is gray and nonscattering  $(\kappa = 0.1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1})$ , has a thickness of  $L = 5\mathrm{cm}$ , and is at radiative equilibrium. Determine the temperature at the bottom/inner surface necessary to dissipate the supplied heat for the three different cases (the radii of the inner cylinder and sphere are  $R_{1} = 5\mathrm{cm}$ ). Discuss the results.

14.13 Consider a very hot sphere of a nongray gas of radius  $R = 1\mathrm{m}$  in  $0\mathrm{K}$  surroundings that have been evacuated. The gas has a single absorption- emission band in the infrared, with an absorption coefficient

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & \eta < 3000\mathrm{cm}^{-1} = \eta_{0}\\ \kappa_{0}e^{-(\eta -\eta_{0}) / \omega}, & \eta >3000\mathrm{cm}^{-1}, \end{array} \right.
$$

where  $\kappa_{0} = 1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ,  $\omega = 200\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . During cool- down the sphere is always isothermal, and remains of constant size (i.e., constant density  $\rho = 1000\mathrm{g / m^3}$ ). The heat capacity of the gas is  $c_{p} = 1\mathrm{kJ / kgK}$ . Determine the time required to cool the gas from  $T_{i} = 6000\mathrm{K}$  to  $T_{e} = 1000\mathrm{K}$ . Sketch qualitatively the behavior of  $\Psi = q / \sigma T^{4}$  vs.  $T$ .

Hint: To make an analytical solution possible, you may make the following assumptions:

(a)  $\mathrm{Ein}(x) = \int_0^1 (1 - e^{-x})d\xi /\xi = E_1(x) + \ln x + \gamma_E\simeq \ln x + \gamma_E$  (for sufficiently large  $x$ ; see also Appendix E). 
(b) Wien's distribution may be used.

14.14 It is proposed to construct a high- temperature heating element by guiding hot combustion gases through a silicon carbide tube. The outside of the SiC tube then radiates heat toward the load. Such devices are known as "radiant tubes." For the design of such a radiant tube you may make the following assumptions:

(a) The combustion gas inside the radiant tube is essentially gray and isothermal with  $\kappa = 0.2\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$  and  $T_{\mathrm{gas}} = 2000\mathrm{K}$ . 
(b) The silicon carbide tube wall is essentially isothermal and of negligible thickness, with a gray-diffuse emittance of 0.8 on both sides. 
(c) The long tube is contained in a large furnace with a background temperature of  $1000\mathrm{K}$ .

Determine the necessary tube diameter to achieve a radiant heating rate of  $100\mathrm{kW}$  per m length of tube.

# CHAPTER 15

# APPROXIMATE SOLUTION METHODS FOR ONE-DIMENSIONAL MEDIA

Because of their importance and their relative simplicity, the cases of gray (or spectral), plane- parallel, or other one- dimensional media bounded by isothermal, gray, diffusely emitting and reflecting walls have been studied extensively. Even for the simplest case the exact solution can only be cast implicitly in the form of an integral equation, thus prompting the development of numerous approximate solution techniques. These approximate methods may roughly be classified into those applicable for limiting conditions (cold medium approximation, optically thin approximation, optically thick approximation) and those making approximations for the directional distribution of intensity (two- flux approximation, moment method). In the following we shall discuss a few of these methods as applied to the one- dimensional case of a medium contained between isothermal gray surfaces. In principle, all of these methods could also be applied to more complicated geometries, although such an extension is not obvious for all of them (and may, indeed, be very tedious). We shall assume that the medium is gray and, therefore, not carry along any spectral subscripts on intensity and other quantities; however, all of the methods discussed here are equally valid on a spectral basis.

# 15.1 THE OPTICALLY THIN APPROXIMATION

The exact integral equations describing incident radiation  $G$  and radiative heat flux  $q$  for a gray medium (or on a spectral basis) confined between two isothermal, gray- diffuse, and parallel plates were developed with equations (14.21) and (14.22) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{G(\tau) = 2J_1E_2(\tau) + 2J_2E_2(\tau_\tau -\tau) + 2\pi \int_0^\tau S(\tau ')E_1(\tau -\tau ')d\tau ' + 2\pi \int_{\tau}^{J_L}S(\tau ')E_1(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau ',}\\ {q(\tau) = 2J_1E_3(\tau) - 2J_2E_3(\tau_\tau -\tau) + 2\pi \int_0^\tau S(\tau ')E_2(\tau -\tau ')d\tau ' - 2\pi \int_{\tau}^{J_L}S(\tau ')E_2(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau ',} \end{array} \tag{15.2}
$$

where  $J_{1}$  and  $J_{2}$  are the radiosities at the two surfaces and the radiative source  $S(\tau)$  has been assumed to be independent of direction [limiting us to isotropic scattering, see equation (14.5)].

We shall now assume that the medium is optically thin, i.e.,  $\tau_{L}\ll 1$  . If we want to evaluate  $q$  accurately up to  $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$  [i.e., neglecting terms of  $\mathcal{O}(\tau^2)$  or smaller], we must evaluate the  $E_{3}$  in equation (15.2) accurate up to  $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$  , while it is sufficient to evaluate  $E_{2}$  (and  $S$  ) accurate up to  $\mathcal{O}(1)$  [since the integration itself is  $\mathcal{O}(\tau)]$  . Thus, with

$$
\begin{array}{r}E_{2}(x) = 1 + \mathcal{O}(x),\qquad E_{3}(x) = \frac{1}{2} -x + \mathcal{O}(x^{2}), \end{array}
$$

we get

$$
q(\tau)\simeq J_1(1 - 2\tau) - J_2(1 - 2\tau_L + 2\tau) + 2\pi \bigg[\int_0^\tau S(\tau ')d\tau ' - \int_\tau^{\tau_L}S(\tau ')d\tau '\bigg]. \tag{15.3}
$$

Evaluating the radiative source, equation (14.5),

$$
S = (1 - \omega)I_{b}(\tau) + \frac{\omega}{4\pi} G(\tau), \tag{15.4}
$$

implies evaluating  $G(\tau)$  accurate up to  $\mathcal{O}(1)$ , i.e., from equation (15.1),

$$
G(\tau) = 2J_{1} + 2J_{2} + \mathcal{O}(\tau) \tag{15.5}
$$

[keeping in mind that, while  $\begin{array}{r}\lim_{x\to 0}E_1(x)\to \infty ,\lim_{x\to 0}xE_1(x)\to 0] \end{array}$  .Either the blackbody intensity,  $I_{b}(\tau),$  is "known" (by considering other modes of heat transfer), or we have  $S = I_{b} =$ $G / 4\pi = (J_{1} + J_{2}) / 2\pi$  (radiative equilibrium in an almost transparent gray medium). Thus, the radiative heat flux for an optically thin slab is:

$I_{b}(\tau)$  specified:

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {q(\tau) = J_{1}[1 - 2(1 - \omega)\tau -\omega \tau_{L}] - J_{2}[1 + 2(1 - \omega)\tau -(2 - \omega)\tau_{L}]}\\ & {\qquad +2\pi (1 - \omega)\bigg[\int_{0}^{\tau}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime} - \int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}I_{b}(\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime}\bigg];} \end{array} \tag{15.6}
$$

Radiative equilibrium:

$$
q = (J_{1} - J_{2})(1 - \tau_{L}) = \mathrm{const}. \tag{15.7}
$$

If the temperature of the medium is specified, we are usually interested in the divergence of the radiative heat flux, or  $dq / dz$  (the radiative source within the overall energy equation). From equation (14.24)

$$
\frac{dq}{d\tau} = (1 - \omega)(4\pi I_b - G). \tag{15.8}
$$

In order to predict  $dq / dz$  accurate to  $\mathcal{O}(\tau)$ , we must specify  $G$  accurate to  $\mathcal{O}(1)$  [since we are using  $\tau$  rather than  $z$  as the independent variable in equation (15.8)]. Thus, from equation (15.5)

$$
\frac{dq}{d\tau} = 2(1 - \omega)(2\pi I_b - J_1 - J_2). \tag{15.9}
$$

Equation (15.6) may be interpreted physically: Intensity leaving the surfaces (radiosities  $J_{1}$  and  $J_{2}$ ) is attenuated by absorption and scattering, but the attenuation is linear since the strength of the radiosities is diminished very little (i.e., every point within the medium has essentially the same incident radiation and, therefore, attenuation rate). The integral terms describe emission within the medium, traveling up (+) and down (- ). Emission is virtually unattenuated by self- absorption since the extinction coefficient is too low. Equation (15.7) shows no dependence on scattering albedo  $\omega$ : In a gray medium at radiative equilibrium it is not possible to distinguish between absorption and isotropic scattering. If a photon is absorbed at a certain location, the same amount of energy must immediately be reemitted isotropically. Since the (different) wavelength of emission cannot be detected for a gray medium, this process is equivalent to isotropic scattering.

# 15.2 THE OPTICALLY THICK APPROXIMATION DIFFUSION APPROXIMATION)

A particularly simple expression for the radiative heat flux can be obtained if the slab is optically thick, or  $\tau_{L}\gg 1$  .We note from equation (15.2) that the radiative source  $S$  is accompanied by an exponential integral that acts as a weight function. If the medium is optically thick, this exponential integral decays very rapidly over a short (geometrical) distance away from  $\tau^{\prime} = \tau$  To exploit this fact we first rewrite equation (15.2) by changing the integration variable  $\tau^{\prime}$  to  $\tau^{\prime \prime} = |\tau - \tau^{\prime}|$  ..

$$
q(\tau) = 2J_{1}E_{3}(\tau) - 2J_{2}E_{3}(\tau_{L} - \tau) + 2\pi \int_{0}^{\tau}S(\tau -\tau^{\prime \prime})E_{2}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} - 2\pi \int_{0}^{\tau_{L} - \tau}S(\tau +\tau^{\prime \prime})E_{2}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime}. \tag{15.10}
$$

We shall now assume that we are a large optical distance away from either of the surfaces, i.e.,  $\tau \gg 1$  and  $\tau_{L} - \tau \gg 1$  . Under these conditions the influence of the boundaries  $(J_{1}$  and  $J_{2}$  ) becomes negligible and the integration limit may be replaced by infinity [since  $E_{2}(\tau^{\prime \prime})\simeq 0$  beyond the actual limits]. Thus,

$$
q(\tau)\simeq 2\pi \int_{0}^{\infty}S(\tau -\tau^{\prime \prime})E_{2}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} - 2\pi \int_{0}^{\infty}S(\tau +\tau^{\prime \prime})E_{2}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime}, \tag{15.11}
$$

where the arguments in  $q$  and  $S$  simply denote a physical location between the two plates. Since  $E_{2}(\tau^{\prime \prime})$  is expected to vanish a very short geometrical distance away from  $\tau^{\prime \prime} = 0$  (or  $\tau^{\prime} = \tau$  ), the radiative source can vary only slightly over this distance. Therefore, we may expand  $S$  into a Taylor series as

$$
S(\tau \pm \tau^{\prime \prime}) = S(\tau)\pm \tau^{\prime \prime}\left(\frac{dS}{d\tau}\right)_{\tau} + \frac{(\tau^{\prime\prime})^{2}}{2}\left(\frac{d^{2}S}{d\tau^{2}}\right)_{\tau}\pm \dots .
$$

Substituting this expression into equation (15.11) leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\frac{q(\tau)}{2\pi} = S(\tau)\int_{0}^{\infty}E_{2}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} - \frac{dS}{d\tau}\int_{0}^{\infty}\tau^{\prime \prime}E_{2}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^{2}S}{d\tau^{2}}\int_{0}^{\infty}(\tau^{\prime \prime})^{2}E_{2}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} - + \dots}\\ {-S(\tau)\int_{0}^{\infty}E_{2}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} - \frac{dS}{d\tau}\int_{0}^{\infty}\tau^{\prime \prime}E_{2}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} - \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^{2}S}{d\tau^{2}}\int_{0}^{\infty}(\tau^{\prime \prime})^{2}E_{2}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} - - \dots}\\ {= -2\frac{dS}{d\tau}\int_{0}^{\infty}xE_{2}(x)dx + \mathcal{O}\Big(\frac{1}{\tau^{3}}\Big).} \end{array}
$$

Evaluating the integral we get, using the relations for exponential integrals in Appendix E,

$$
\int_0^\infty xE_2(x)dx = -xE_3(x)\bigg|_0^\infty +\int_0^\infty E_3(x)dx = -E_4(x)\bigg|_0^\infty = \frac{1}{3},
$$

and

$$
q(\tau) = -\frac{4\pi}{3}\frac{dS}{d\tau}. \tag{15.12}
$$

For a nonscattering medium, or a gray medium at radiative equilibrium,  $S = I_{b},$  and equation (15.12) reduces to

$$
q(\tau) = -\frac{4\pi}{3}\frac{dI_b}{d\tau}. \tag{15.13}
$$

For the general case of an isotropically scattering medium the radiative source must be determined from equation (15.4) by first determining the incident radiation  $G(\tau)$  from equation (15.1). Following the same procedure as for  $q(\tau)$ , we get

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\frac{G(\tau)}{2\pi} = S(\tau)\int_{0}^{\infty}E_{1}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} - \frac{dS}{d\tau}\int_{0}^{\infty}\tau^{\prime \prime}E_{1}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^{2}S}{d\tau^{2}}\int_{0}^{\infty}(\tau^{\prime \prime})^{2}E_{1}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} - + \dots}\\ {+S(\tau)\int_{0}^{\infty}E_{1}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} + \frac{dS}{d\tau}\int_{0}^{\infty}\tau^{\prime \prime}E_{1}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} + \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^{2}S}{d\tau^{2}}\int_{0}^{\infty}(\tau^{\prime \prime})^{2}E_{1}(\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} + + \dots}\\ {= 2S(\tau)\int_{0}^{\infty}E_{1}(\tau^{\prime \prime})d\tau^{\prime \prime} + \mathcal{O}\bigg(\frac{1}{\tau^{2}}\bigg) = 2S(\tau),} \end{array} \tag{15.14}
$$

or

$$
\frac{G}{4\pi} = S = (1 - \omega)I_b + \omega \frac{G}{4\pi}
$$

and

$$
S(\tau) = \frac{G}{4\pi} (\tau) = I_b(\tau).
$$

Thus, for an optically thick, isotropically scattering medium equation (15.13) holds, whether the medium is at radiative equilibrium or not, and the heat flux, on a spectral basis, is determined from

$$
q_{\eta} = -\frac{4\pi}{3\beta_{R}}\frac{dI_{b\eta}}{dz}, \tag{15.15}
$$

or, after integration over wavenumbers, the total heat flux from

$$
q = -\frac{4\sigma}{3\beta_R}\frac{d(n^2T^4)}{dz}, \tag{15.16}
$$

where  $\beta_{R}$  is the Rosseland- mean extinction coefficient as defined in equation (11.188). Equations (15.15) and (15.16) are commonly known as the Rosseland approximation, since they were originally derived by Rosseland [1], or the diffusion approximation, since equation (15.16) is of the same type as Fourier's law of heat diffusion and Fick's law of mass diffusion.

The diffusion approximation is extremely convenient to use. One may even define a "radiative conductivity"

$$
k_{R} = \frac{16n^{2}\sigma T^{3}}{3\beta_{R}}, \tag{15.17}
$$

so that

$$
q = -k_{R}\frac{dT}{dz}, \tag{15.18}
$$

and the radiation problem reduces to a simple conduction problem with strongly temperature- dependent conductivity. Similar to Fourier's law, equation (15.15) may be extended to three- dimensional geometries by writing

$$
\mathbf{q}_{\eta} = -\frac{4\pi}{3\beta_{\eta}}\nabla I_{b\eta}, \tag{15.19}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{q} = -\frac{4\sigma}{3\beta_R}\nabla (n^2 T^4) = -k_R\nabla T. \tag{15.20}
$$

However, it is important to keep in mind that the diffusion approximation is not valid near a boundary, where it often fails quite miserably. In practice, the method is useful only in optically extremely thick situations (for example, heat transfer through hot glass and other semitransparent materials).

Example 15.1. Consider a gray, isothermal medium at temperature  $T$ , confined between two parallel, black, isothermal plates both at temperature  $T_{w}$ . Determine the radiative heat flux as a function of distance across the layer, using the diffusion approximation.

# Solution

From equation (15.16) we find  $q \equiv 0$  everywhere inside the medium, while  $q \to \infty$  at both surfaces (because of the temperature jump there). The diffusion approximation is clearly inadequate in the optical vicinity of walls, in particular if temperature discontinuities are present.

Example 15.2. Now consider a gray medium contained between two black, isothermal cylinders. The inner cylinder has a radius of  $R_{1}$  and is at temperature  $T_{1}$ . The outer cylinder has a radius of  $R_{2}$  and is at temperature  $T_{2}$ . The medium absorbs and emits but does not scatter radiation, and radiative equilibrium prevails. Determine temperature profile and heat flux across the medium.

# Solution

From the condition of radiative equilibrium,

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = \frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr} (rq) = 0,
$$

we find  $rq = C_{1}^{\prime} = \mathrm{const}$ , or  $q = C_{1}^{\prime} / r = C_{1} / \tau$  if the optical coordinate  $\tau = \kappa r$  is used. Thus, from equation (15.13)

$$
q = \frac{C_1}{\tau} = -\frac{4\sigma}{3}\frac{dT^4}{d\tau}
$$

(assuming a refractive index of unity). We may integrate this expression to find

$$
\sigma T^4 = -\frac{3}{4} C_1\ln \tau +C_2, \tag{15.21}
$$

or, using the boundary conditions  $T = T_{1}$  at  $r = R_{1}$  and  $T = T_{2}$  at  $r = R_{2}$ ,

$$
\frac{T^4 - T_1^4}{T_2^4 - T_1^4} = \frac{\ln(\tau / \tau_1)}{\ln(\tau_2 / \tau_1)},
$$

and

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = \frac{4}{3\tau\ln(\tau_2 / \tau_1)}. \tag{15.22}
$$

As seen by comparison with the exact and other approximate solutions in Fig. 15- 1, equation (15.22) does reasonably well for optically thick situations, but fails for the optically thin limit as  $\kappa \to 0$ , where  $\Psi \to \infty$  [as opposed to the correct limit,  $\Psi (R_{1}) = 1$ ].

# Deissler's Jump Boundary Conditions

When we derived equation (15.13) we assumed that the medium was optically thick  $(\tau_{L} \gg 1)$  and that we were far removed from a boundary  $(\tau \gg 0, \tau_{L} - \tau \gg 0)$ . But in the examples we assumed that equation (15.13) holds also at the walls and found the temperature profile by using the boundary temperatures (Example 15.2). The examples showed that this assumption is not very good. Deissler [2] argued that, while flux must be conserved [and, therefore, equation (15.13) must hold at the surface if it holds inside the medium adjacent to it], no radiative principle states that the temperature of the surface and adjacent medium must be continuous (as already known

![](images/46111238dd8ed08d93bf6298fd553f31fd3801efdbba9dc81c24d10980f20e19.jpg)

from the exact solution).1 To develop a boundary condition, he used the same principles that were applied to equation (15.10) and the development following it, and applied them to a point at the boundary. For  $\tau = 0$  equation (15.10) becomes (with  $\tau_{L} \gg 1$ )

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q(0) = J_1 - 2\pi \int_0^\infty S(\tau '')E_2(\tau '')d\tau ''}\\ {= J_1 - 2\pi \left[S(0)\int_0^\infty E_2(\tau '')d\tau '' + \frac{dS}{d\tau} (0)\int_0^\infty \tau ''E_2(\tau '')d\tau ''\right.}\\ {\left. + \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2S}{d\tau^2} (0)\int_0^\infty (\tau '')^2 E_2(\tau '')d\tau '' + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\tau^3}\right)\right].} \end{array}
$$

Using equation (15.15) this expression becomes

$$
q(0) = J_{1} - \pi I_{b}(0) - \frac{2\pi}{3}\frac{dI_{b}}{d\tau} (0) - \frac{\pi}{2}\frac{d^{2}I_{b}}{d\tau^{2}} (0) + \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\tau^{3}}\right). \tag{15.23}
$$

Deissler truncated the series after the second derivative since doing so gives the same level of approximation as equation (15.13). Substituting equation (15.13) into equation (15.23) leads to

$$
J_{1} = \pi I_{b}(0) - \frac{2\pi}{3}\frac{dI_{b}}{d\tau} (0) + \frac{\pi}{2}\frac{d^{2}I_{b}}{d\tau^{2}} (0). \tag{15.24}
$$

For radiative equilibrium of a one- dimensional slab this further simplifies to

$$
J_{1} - \pi I_{b}(0) = -\frac{2\pi}{3}\frac{dI_{b}}{d\tau} (0) = \frac{1}{2} q(0) = \frac{1}{2} q, \tag{15.25}
$$

since  $q =$  const and, therefore,  $d^{2}I_{b} / d\tau^{2} = 0$

The jump boundary condition may be generalized to multidimensional geometries [2]:

$$
J_{w}(\mathbf{r}_{w}) = \pi I_{b}(\mathbf{r}_{w}) - \frac{2\pi}{3}\frac{\partial I_{b}}{\partial\tau_{z}} (\mathbf{r}_{w}) + \frac{\pi}{4}\left(2\frac{\partial^{2}I_{b}}{\partial\tau_{z}^{2}} +\frac{\partial^{2}I_{b}}{\partial\tau_{x}^{2}} +\frac{\partial^{2}I_{b}}{\partial\tau_{y}^{2}}\right)(\mathbf{r}_{w}), \tag{15.26}
$$

where  $\tau_z$  is, as before, an optical coordinate measured in the direction of the outward surface normal, and  $\tau_x$  and  $\tau_y$  are optical coordinates tangential to the surface.

Example 15.3. Repeat Example 15.2 using Deissler's jump boundary conditions.

# Solution

For a cylindrical coordinate system, equation (15.26) becomes2

$$
\begin{array}{ll}\tau = \tau_1: & \sigma T_1^4 = \sigma T^4 -\frac{2}{3}\sigma \frac{dT^4}{d\tau} +\frac{\sigma}{4}\left(\frac{1}{\tau}\frac{dT^4}{d\tau} +2\frac{d^2T^4}{d\tau^2}\right),\\ \displaystyle \tau = \tau_2: & \sigma T_2^4 = \sigma T^4 +\frac{2}{3}\sigma \frac{dT^4}{d\tau} +\frac{\sigma}{4}\left(\frac{1}{\tau}\frac{dT^4}{d\tau} +2\frac{d^2T^4}{d\tau^2}\right) \end{array}
$$

[the change of sign in the second boundary condition is due to the fact that in equation (15.24)  $\tau$  is measured away from the surface, while at  $\tau_2$  it is measured toward the surface]. Utilizing the general diffusion solution for a one- dimensional cylinder at radiative equilibrium, equation (15.21), we find

$$
\begin{array}{ll}\tau = \tau_1: & \sigma T_1^4 = C_2 - \frac{3}{4} C_1\ln \tau_1 + \frac{C_1}{2\tau_1} +\frac{3C_1}{16\tau_1^2},\\ \displaystyle \tau = \tau_2: & \sigma T_2^4 = C_2 - \frac{3}{4} C_1\ln \tau_2 - \frac{C_1}{2\tau_2} +\frac{3C_1}{16\tau_2^2}. \end{array}
$$

From these two equations we obtain

$$
C_1 = \frac{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\frac{3}{4}\ln\frac{\tau_2}{\tau_1} + \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{\tau_1} + \frac{1}{\tau_2}\right) + \frac{3}{16}\left(\frac{1}{\tau_1^2} - \frac{1}{\tau_2^2}\right)},
$$

and, with  $q_{1} = C_{1} / \tau_{1},$

$$
\Psi = \frac{q_1}{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = 1 / \left[\frac{3\tau_1}{4}\ln \frac{\tau_2}{\tau_1} +\frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \frac{\tau_1}{\tau_2}\right) + \frac{3}{16\tau_1}\left(1 - \frac{\tau_1^2}{\tau_2^2}\right)\right].
$$

A plot of this nondimensional flux is also included in Fig. 15- 1.

# 15.3 THE SCHUSTER-SCHWARZSCHILD APPROXIMATION

A very simple solution method for a one- dimensional, plane- parallel slab was given independently by Schuster [3] and Schwarzschild [4]. While they limited their derivation to nonscattering media, the method is readily extended to include isotropic scattering, which we will consider here. The equation of transfer for a one- dimensional, plane- parallel, isotropically scattering, gray medium (or on a spectral basis) is, setting  $\Phi \equiv 1$  in equation (14.19),

$$
\mu \frac{dI}{d\tau} = (1 - \omega)I_b - I + \frac{\omega}{2}\int_{-1}^{+1}Id\mu , - 1< \mu < +1. \tag{15.27}
$$

Schuster and Schwarzschild assumed the radiative intensity to be isotropic, but different, over the upper and lower hemisphere, that is,

$$
I(\tau ,\mu) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}I^{-}(\tau), & -1< \mu < 0,\\ I^{+}(\tau), & 0< \mu < +1. \end{array} \right. \tag{15.28}
$$

Substituting this expression into equation (15.27) leads to

$$
\frac{dI}{d\tau} = (1 - \omega)I_b - I + \frac{\omega}{2} (I^- +I^+). \tag{15.29}
$$

Because of the approximation made for  $I$ , equation (15.29) can, of course, only be solved in an approximate way. Since intensity has been reduced to two unknown functions of space only, equation (15.29) must be reduced to two space- dependent equations. Integrating equation (15.29) over the upper and lower hemispheres, respectively, achieves this goal and results in

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\frac{1}{2}\frac{dI^{+}}{d\tau} = (1 - \omega)I_{b} - I^{+} + \frac{\omega}{2} (I^{-} + I^{+}),}\\ {-\frac{1}{2}\frac{dI^{-}}{d\tau} = (1 - \omega)I_{b} - I^{-} + \frac{\omega}{2} (I^{-} + I^{+}),} \end{array} \tag{15.30b}
$$

subject to the boundary conditions

$$
\begin{array}{rl}\tau = 0: & I^{+} = J_{1} / \pi ,\\ \tau = \tau_{L}: & I^{-} = J_{2} / \pi , \end{array} \tag{15.31b}
$$

where  $J_{1}$  and  $J_{2}$  are the radiosities of the bounding plates. From the definitions for incident radiation and radiative heat flux we find

$$
G = 2\pi \int_{-1}^{1}I d\mu = 2\pi (I^{+} + I^{-}), \tag{15.32}
$$

and

$$
q = 2\pi \int_{-1}^{1}I\mu d\mu = \pi (I^{+} - I^{-}). \tag{15.33}
$$

$I^{+}$  and  $I^{- }$  are easily eliminated from equations (15.30) and their boundary conditions (by adding and subtracting the equations), leading to

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{dq}{d\tau} = (1 - \omega)(4\pi I_b - G),\\ \displaystyle \frac{dG}{d\tau} = -4q,\\ \displaystyle \tau = 0:G + 2q = 4J_1,\\ \displaystyle \tau = \tau_{L}:G - 2q = 4J_2. \end{array} \tag{15.36b}
$$

Example 15.4. Find an expression for the heat flux within a gray, nonscattering isothermal medium (temperature  $T$ ) confined between two isothermal, parallel, black plates at (the same) temperature  $T_{w}$ . Use the Schuster- Schwarzschild approximation.

# Solution

Differentiating equation (15.34) and using equation (15.35) gives

$$
\frac{d^2q}{d\tau^2} = -\frac{dG}{d\tau} = 4q,
$$

or

$$
q = C_{1}e^{2\tau} + C_{2}e^{-2\tau},
$$

subject to the boundary conditions

$$
\begin{array}{ll}\tau = 0: & 4\sigma T^4 -\frac{dq}{d\tau} +2q = 4\sigma T_w^4,\\ \displaystyle \tau = \tau_{L}: & 4\sigma T^4 -\frac{dq}{d\tau} -2q = 4\sigma T_w^4, \end{array}
$$

in which  $G$  has been eliminated using equation (15.34) and  $J_{1} = J_{2} = \sigma T_{w}^{4}$ . Substituting the expression for heat flux into the boundary condition gives

$$
\begin{array}{r}(2 - 2)C_1 + (2 + 2)C_2 = 4\sigma (T_w^4 -T^4),\\ -(2 + 2)C_1e^{2\tau_L} - (2 - 2)C_2e^{-2\tau_L} = 4\sigma (T_w^4 -T^4), \end{array}
$$

or

$$
C_2 = -C_1e^{2\tau_L} = \sigma (T_w^4 -T^4)
$$

and

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{\sigma(T^4 - T_w^4)} = e^{-2(\tau_L - \tau)} - e^{-2\tau_L}
$$

This nondimensional flux, evaluated at a wall, is plotted in Fig. 15- 2, along with the exact solution and another approximate method.

The Schuster- Schwarzschild approximation always goes to the correct optically thin limit  $(\tau_{L}\rightarrow 0)$ , since in that case the treatment is exact. Since it breaks up the intensity functions into two constant components for two directions, the method is also commonly referred to as the two- flux approximation. Obviously, the method is easily generalized to higher order (breaking up the  $4\pi$  directions in more than two components and directions, or discrete ordinates), as well as to multidimensional geometries. For example, six- flux methods have been used by Chin and Churchill [5] and by Shih and Chen [6]; a review of the six- flux method has been given by Chan [7]. The general discrete ordinates method will be discussed in detail in Chapter 17.

# 15.4 THE MILNE-EDDINGTON APPROXIMATION (MOMENT METHOD)

Another simple method for the case of a one- dimensional, plane- parallel medium has been developed independently by Milne [8] and Eddington [9]. The method is also commonly referred to as the differential approximation, especially when generalized to more complicated geometries. Starting from equation (15.27) they took the zeroth and first moments of the equation, i.e., they integrated equation (15.27) over all directions after multiplication with  $\mu^0 = 1$  (zeroth moment) and  $\mu^1 = \mu$  (first moment). Defining intensity moments as

$$
I_{k} = 2\pi \int_{-1}^{1}I\mu^{k}d\mu ,k = 0,1,\ldots \tag{15.37}
$$

leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{dI_1}{d\tau} = (1 - \omega)4\pi I_b - I_0 + \omega I_0 = (1 - \omega)(4\pi I_b - I_0),\\ \displaystyle \frac{dI_2}{d\tau} = -I_1, \end{array} \tag{15.39}
$$

or two equations in three unknowns,  $I_0, I_1,$  and  $I_2$ . To make the system determinate, a closing condition must be found, i.e., a relationship between  $I_0, I_1,$  and  $I_2$ . Milne and Eddington, like Schuster and Schwarzschild, assumed the intensity to be isotropic over both the upper and lower hemisphere. Thus,

$$
I_{k} = 2\pi \left(I^{-}\int_{-1}^{0}\mu^{k}d\mu +I^{+}\int_{0}^{1}\mu^{k}d\mu\right) = \frac{2\pi}{k + 1}\left[(-1)^{k}I^{-} + I^{+}\right], \tag{15.40}
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{r}I_2 = \frac{1}{3} I_0. \end{array} \tag{15.41}
$$

With  $G = I_0$  and  $q = I_1$  equation (15.41) transforms (15.38) and (15.39) to

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{dq}{d\tau} = (1 - \omega)(4\pi I_b - G),\\ \displaystyle \frac{dG}{d\tau} = -3q. \end{array} \tag{15.43}
$$

The boundary conditions are identical to those of the Schuster- Schwarzschild approximation, equation (15.31), again leading to

$$
\begin{array}{rl}\tau = 0: & G + 2q = 4J_1,\\ \tau = \tau_L: & G - 2q = 4J_2. \end{array} \tag{15.44b}
$$

In the case of radiative equilibrium we have  $dq / d\tau = 0$  and, therefore,  $G = 4\pi I_b$ . For this case equation (15.43) reduces to

$$
q = -\frac{4\pi}{3}\frac{dI_b}{d\tau}, \tag{15.45}
$$

which is the same as for the diffusion approximation (although the boundary conditions are different and, for large  $\tau_L$ , are carried to one additional order of accuracy in the diffusion approximation).

Example 15.5. Consider a gray medium with refractive index  $n = 1$ , confined between two isothermal, black, parallel plates at temperatures  $T_1$  and  $T_2$ , respectively. As in Example 15.2 the medium is at radiative equilibrium and absorbs and emits, but does not scatter radiation. Determine the heat flux between the plates using the differential approximation.

# Solution

For a gray, nonscattering medium at radiative equilibrium equations (15.42) and (15.43) reduce to

$$
\begin{array}{c}\frac{dq}{d\tau} = 4\sigma T^4 -G = 0,\quad \mathrm{or}\quad q = \mathrm{const},\\ \displaystyle \frac{dG}{d\tau} = -3q,\quad \mathrm{or}\quad G = 4\sigma T^4 = C - 3q\tau . \end{array}
$$

Applying the boundary conditions we get

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}\tau = 0: & C & +2q = 4\sigma T_1^4,\\ \tau = \tau_L: & C - 3q\tau_L - 2q = 4\sigma T_2^4, \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{3}{4}\tau_L}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l}{C = 4\sigma T_1^4 -2q,}\\ {}\\ {\Phi = \frac{T_1^4 - T^4}{T_1^4 - T_2^4} = \frac{2 + 3\tau}{4 + 3\tau_L}.} \end{array}
$$

It is easy to show that this result is identical to the one obtained from the diffusion approximation with Deissler's jump boundary conditions (for example, by letting  $\tau_{2} = \tau_{1} + \tau_{L}$  and  $\tau_{1}\to \infty$  in Example 15.3).

Example 15.6. Repeat Example 15.2 using the differential approximation.

# Solution

For the one- dimensional case of a medium at radiative equilibrium between concentric cylinders the divergence of the radiative heat flux is, in cylindrical coordinates,

$$
\frac{1}{\tau}\frac{d}{d\tau} (\tau q) = 4\sigma T^4 -G = 0,
$$

or

$$
q = \frac{C_1}{\tau}.
$$

Substituting this expression into equation (15.45) gives

$$
\sigma T^4 = -\textstyle \frac{3}{4} C_1\ln \tau +C_2,
$$

which is, of course, the same as for the diffusion approximation (since we have radiative equilibrium). Applying the boundary conditions (with  $G = 4\sigma T^4$ ) gives

$$
\begin{array}{rl}\tau = \tau_1: & -\frac{3}{4} C_1\ln \tau_1 + C_2 + \frac{C_1}{2\tau_1} = \sigma T_1^4,\\ \tau = \tau_2: & -\frac{3}{4} C_1\ln \tau_2 + C_2 - \frac{C_1}{2\tau_2} = \sigma T_2^4, \end{array}
$$

or

$$
C_1 = \frac{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{\tau_1} + \frac{1}{\tau_2}\right) + \frac{3}{4}\ln\frac{\tau_2}{\tau_1}}
$$

and

$$
\Psi = \frac{q_1}{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = 1\bigg / \bigg[\frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \frac{\tau_1}{\tau_2}\right) + \frac{3}{4}\tau_1\ln \frac{\tau_2}{\tau_1}\bigg].
$$

Results from the differential approximation are also included in Fig. 15- 1. Note that the diffusion approximation with jump conditions outperforms the differential approximation over a large range of optical depths (since it has a higher order boundary condition), but fails much more severely in optically thin cases.

Like the Schuster- Schwarzschild approximation, the Milne- Eddington approximation may be generalized to higher order as well as to more general geometries. It is then known as the moment method, in which the radiative intensity is approximated by

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_0(\mathbf{r}) + I_{1x}(\mathbf{r})s_x + I_{1y}(\mathbf{r})s_y + I_{1z}(\mathbf{r})s_z + I_{2xx}(\mathbf{r})s_x^2 +I_{2xy}(\mathbf{r})s_x s_y + \dots \\ & \qquad = I_0(\mathbf{r}) + \mathbf{I}_1(\mathbf{r})\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} +\mathbf{I}_2(\mathbf{r}):\hat{\mathbf{s}}\hat{\mathbf{s}} +\dots . \end{array} \tag{15.46}
$$

Here the  $s_x = \hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{1}} = \sin \theta \cos \psi , s_y = \hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{1}} = \sin \theta \sin \psi ,$  and  $s_z = \hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{k}} = \cos \theta$  are the direction cosines of the unit direction vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ .  $I_0$  is a scalar to be determined (related to  $G$ ),  $\mathbf{I}_1$  is a vector

(related to  $\mathbf{q}$ ),  $\mathbf{I}_2$  is a second- rank tensor (which may be related to radiation pressure), and so on. The unknowns are determined by taking moments of the equation of transfer, i.e., by integrating it over all directions after multiplication by  $1, s_x, s_y, s_z, s_x^2, s_x s_y, \ldots$ . The method has been shown by Krook [10] to be completely equivalent to the method of spherical harmonics (using spherical harmonics, which are functions of direction cosines, and exploiting their orthogonality properties). That method will be discussed in detail in Chapter 16.

# 15.5 THE EXPONENTIAL KERNEL APPROXIMATION

Another popular way to solve equations (15.1) and (15.2) in an approximate way is known as the exponential kernel approximation. In this method the kernels of the integrals  $[E_1$  in equation (15.1), and  $E_2$  in equation (15.2)], are approximated by functions of exponentials  $(e^x, \cosh x, \sinh x, \cos x, \sin x)$ . Since these functions have repetitive derivatives (except for constant factors), this fact enables us to eliminate the integrals from equations (15.1) and (15.2) and transform them into differential equations. We shall demonstrate the method here by solving equation (15.2) with a very simple approximate kernel of the form

$$
E_{2}(x)\simeq ae^{-bx}. \tag{15.47}
$$

More elaborate approximations could consist of a sum of exponentials, for example (as long as derivatives with respect to  $x$  are repetitive). To determine the "best" values for  $a$  and  $b$ , one could choose either to satisfy equation (15.47) at two selected points, or to satisfy equation (15.47) in an integral sense. How exactly the values of  $a$  and  $b$  are determined is somewhat arbitrary and should be decided by studying the problem at hand (is the medium optically thin, thick, covering all ranges?). The most common method of finding  $a$  and  $b$  is to take the zeroth and first moments of equation (15.47):

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\int_0^\infty E_2(x)dx = -E_3(x)\bigg|_0^\infty = \frac{1}{2} = a\int_0^\infty e^{-bx}dx = -\frac{a}{b} e^{-bx}\bigg|_0^\infty = \frac{a}{b},}\\ {\int_0^\infty xE_2(x)dx = \frac{1}{3} = a\int_0^\infty xe^{-bx}dx = \frac{a}{b^2},} \end{array}
$$

or

$$
a = \textstyle \frac{3}{4},\quad b = \textstyle \frac{3}{2},\quad E_2(x)\simeq \textstyle \frac{3}{4} e^{-3x / 2}.
$$

While  $E_1(x)$  and  $E_3(x)$  could be found in a similar fashion, it is usually preferred (for consistency, and numerical simplicity) to use the recursion formulae for exponential integrals, as given in Appendix E. Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{E_1(x) = -\frac{dE_2}{dx}\simeq \frac{9}{8} e^{-3x / 2},}\\ {E_3(x) = \int_x^\infty E_2(x)dx\simeq \frac{1}{2} e^{-3x / 2}.} \end{array}
$$

A plot of these approximations is given in Fig. 15- 3. With them equation (15.2) may be rewritten as

$$
q(\tau) = J_1e^{-3\tau /2} - J_2e^{-3(\tau_L - \tau) / 2} + \frac{3\pi}{2}\left[\int_0^\tau S(\tau ')e^{-3(\tau -\tau ') / 2}d\tau ' - \int_\tau^{\tau_L}S(\tau ')e^{-3(\tau ' - \tau) / 2}d\tau '\right]. \tag{15.48}
$$

Differentiating this equation twice with respect to  $\tau$  results in

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\frac{d^2q}{d\tau^2} = \frac{9}{4} J_1e^{-3\tau /2} - \frac{9}{4} J_2e^{-3(\tau_L - \tau) / 2} + 3\pi \frac{dS}{d\tau}}\\ {+\frac{27\pi}{8}\left[\int_0^\tau S(\tau ')e^{-3(\tau -\tau ') / 2}d\tau ' - \int_\tau^{\tau_L}S(\tau ')e^{-3(\tau ' - \tau) / 2}d\tau '\right],} \end{array} \tag{15.49}
$$

FIGURE 15-3 Approximations for exponential integrals.

or, using equation (15.48) to eliminate the integrals,

$$
\frac{d^2q}{d\tau^2} -\frac{9}{4} q = 3\pi \frac{dS}{d\tau} = 3\pi \frac{d}{d\tau}\left[(1 - \omega)I_b + \frac{\omega}{4\pi} G\right]. \tag{15.50}
$$

The source function is either known or must be determined by performing a similar procedure on equation (15.1). Equation (15.50) is a second- order differential equation and, thus, requires two boundary conditions (while an integral equation does not require any boundary conditions). The problem is overcome by substituting the solution to equation (15.50) back into equation (15.48). Since two boundary conditions are required it is sufficient to do this at two selected locations, say  $\tau = 0$  and  $\tau = \tau_{L}$ .

Example 15.7. Redo Example 15.5 using the exponential kernel approximation.

# Solution

For  $\omega = 0$  we have  $S = I_{b} = \sigma T^{4} / \pi$ , and for radiative equilibrium  $dq / d\tau = 0$  (and, therefore,  $d^{2}q / d\tau^{2} = 0$ ). Thus, from equation (15.50), we get

$$
q = -\frac{4\sigma}{3}\frac{dT^4}{d\tau} = \mathrm{const},
$$

which is the same as for the diffusion approximation as well as for the differential approximation. Integration gives

$$
\sigma T^4 = C - \textstyle \frac{3}{4} q\tau .
$$

Substituting this expression into equation (15.48) leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q = \sigma T_1^4 e^{-3\tau /2} - \sigma T_2^4 e^{-3(\tau_L - \tau) / 2} + \frac{3}{2}\left[\int_0^\tau \left(C - \frac{3}{4} q\tau '\right)e^{-3(\tau -\tau) / 2}d\tau ' - \int_{\tau}^{T_L}\left(C - \frac{3}{4} q\tau '\right)e^{-3(\tau ' - \tau) / 2}d\tau '\right]}\\ {= \left(\sigma T_1^4 -C - \frac{q}{2}\right)e^{-3\tau /2} - \left(\sigma T_2^4 -C + \frac{q}{2} +\frac{3}{4} q\tau_L\right)e^{-3(\tau_L - \tau) / 2} + q.} \end{array}
$$

Since this equation must hold for all values of  $\tau$ , both expressions within the parentheses must vanish,

$$
\begin{array}{l}\sigma T_1^4 = C + \frac{q}{2},\\ \sigma T_2^4 = C - \frac{q}{2} -\frac{3}{4}\tau_Lq, \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{3}{4}\tau_L}.
$$

This result is identical to the ones from the diffusion approximation with jump conditions, and from the differential approximation, Example 15.5.

Hint: Introduce a local Cartesian coordinate system at a point at the boundary, express any other  $r$ - location within the medium in terms of  $x, y, z$ , and transform the derivatives in equation (15.26) to  $r$ - derivatives; finally let  $x, y, z$  go to zero (since the derivatives at the boundary are needed).

15.2 The gap between two parallel black plates at  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , respectively, is filled with a particle- laden gas. Radiative equilibrium prevails, and the particle loading is a fixed volume fraction, with particles manufactured from two different materials (one a specular reflector, the other a diffuse reflector, both having the same  $\epsilon$ ). Sketch the nondimensional heat flux  $\Psi = q / \sigma (T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4})$  vs. particle size (but keeping volume fraction constant).

15.3 Consider radiative equilibrium of a gray, absorbing, emitting, and isotropically scattering medium contained between two isothermal, gray- diffuse, parallel plates spaced a distance  $L$  apart. Determine the nondimensional temperature variation within the medium,  $\Phi = (\sigma T^{4} - J_{2}) / (J_{1} - J_{2})$  for the optically thin case  $(\tau_{L} \ll 1)$ .

15.10 Consider a space enclosed by infinite, diffuse- gray, parallel plates  $1\mathrm{m}$  apart filled with a gray, nonscattering medium  $(\kappa = 5\mathrm{m}^{- 1})$ . The surfaces are isothermal (both at  $T_{w} = 500\mathrm{K}$  with emittance  $\epsilon_{w} = 0.6$ ), and there is uniform and constant heat generation within the medium per unit volume,  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} = 10^{6}\mathrm{W / m}^{3}$ . Conduction and convection are negligible such that  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = \dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}$ .

15.14 Consider  $(a)$  two parallel plates and  $(b)$  two concentric spheres. The bottom/inner surface needs to dissipate a heat flux of  $30\mathrm{W / cm}^2$  and has a gray- diffuse emittance  $\epsilon_{1} = 0.5$ . The top/outer surface is at  $T_{2} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  with  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.8$ . The medium in between the surfaces is gray and nonscattering  $(\kappa = 0.1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1})$ , has a thickness of  $L = 5\mathrm{cm}$ , and is at radiative equilibrium. Determine the temperature at the bottom/inner surface necessary to dissipate the supplied heat for the two different cases (the radius of the inner sphere is  $R_{1} = 5\mathrm{cm}$ ) using the Milne- Eddington approximation. Compare with the results of Problem 14.12.

15.15 A material produces an amount of heat that is constant per unit volume, i.e.,  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} = \text{const}$ . This heat production needs to be removed by thermal radiation. It is proposed to grind up the (fixed volume of) material into small particles, which are to be suspended evenly between two cold plates of (identical) emittance  $\epsilon$ . Since it is important to keep the overall temperature level in the particles as low as possible, should the particles be ground as fine as possible, as large as possible, or does some optimum radius exist? What is the optimum particle size, and what is the maximum temperature if this size is employed? You may assume one- dimensional parallel plates with a constant volume fraction of particles, black particles with relatively large size parameters, and you may use the Schuster- Schwarzschild approximation.

# CHAPTER 16

# THE METHOD OF SPHERICAL HARMONICS ( $P_N$ -APPROXIMATION)

# 16.1 INTRODUCTION

For a gray medium (or on a spectral basis) with known temperature distribution (or for the case of radiative equilibrium), the general problem of radiative transfer entails determining the radiative intensity from an integro- differential equation in five independent variables—three space coordinates and two direction coordinates—a prohibitive task. The method of spherical harmonics provides a vehicle to obtain an approximate solution of arbitrarily high order (i.e., accuracy), by transforming the equation of transfer into a set of simultaneous partial differential equations (PDEs). The approach was first proposed by Jeans [1] in his work on radiative transfer in stars. Further description of the method may be found in the books by Kourganoff [2], Davison [3], and Murray [4] (the latter two dealing with the closely related neutron transport theory). The spherical harmonics method is identical to the moment method described in Chapter 15, except that moments are taken in such a way as to take advantage of the orthogonality of spherical harmonics.

The great advantage of the method of spherical harmonics is the conversion of the governing equation to relatively simple partial differential equations. The drawback of the method is that low- order approximations are usually only accurate in media with near- isotropic radiative intensity, and accuracy improves only slowly for higher- order approximations while mathematical complexity increases extremely rapidly. This has prompted several researchers in the neutron transport community, notably Gelbard [5], to develop an approximate spherical harmonics method, known as the simplified  $P_N$ - approximation, or  $SP_N$ . While more readily taken to higher order, this method does not approach the exact solution in the limit.

It is a common misconception that the lowest- order  $P_1$ - approximation fails in optically thin media: as seen from Fig. 15- 2 or Example 16.2 below, when emission from a hot medium is considered, the  $P_1$ - approximation goes to the correct optically thin limit but may fail in the optically thick limit. Rather, the  $P_1$ - approximation loses accuracy, e.g., when an optically thin medium acts as a radiation barrier between hot and cold surfaces, in the presence of collimated irradiation, etc.

In this chapter we shall first develop the set of partial differential equations for the general  $P_N$ - method for one- dimensional plane- parallel media and their boundary conditions.2 Next we deal in more detail with the most popular  $P_1$ - approximation for arbitrary geometries. Then a brief presentation of the  $P_3$  and higher- order approximation is given. This is followed by a description of the  $SP_N$  scheme and, finally, the chapter concludes with a discussion of a number of variations on the  $P_N$ - approximation that attempt to overcome its inaccuracy in strongly anisotropic situations, most notably the modified differential approximation (MDA), which separates radiation emanating from walls from the radiation emanating from within the medium. While such methods deliver better accuracy, they are no longer the solution to a simple partial differential equation, but also require the evaluation of some integral correction factors.

# 16.2 GENERAL FORMULATION OF THE  $P_N$ -APPROXIMATION

We may think of the radiative intensity field  $I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})^3$  at location  $\mathbf{r}$  within the medium as the value of a scalar function on the surface of a sphere of unit radius, surrounding the point  $\mathbf{r}$ . Any such function may be expressed in terms of a two- dimensional generalized Fourier series as

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \sum_{l = 0}^{\infty}\sum_{m = -l}^{l}I_{l}^{m}(\mathbf{r})Y_{l}^{m}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}), \tag{16.1}
$$

where the  $I_{l}^{m}(\mathbf{r})$  are position- dependent coefficients and the  $Y_{l}^{m}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})$  are spherical harmonics, given by

$$
Y_{n}^{m}(\theta ,\phi) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\cos (m\psi)P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta), & \mathrm{for} m\geq 0,\\ \sin (m\psi)P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta), & \mathrm{for} m< 0, \end{array} \right. \tag{16.2}
$$

that satisfy Laplace's equation in spherical coordinates. Here  $\theta$  and  $\psi$  are the polar and azimuthal angles describing the direction unit vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , respectively, and the  $P_{l}^{m}$  are associated Legendre polynomials, given by

$$
P_{n}^{m}(\mu) = (-1)^{m}\frac{(1 - \mu^{2})^{|m| / 2}}{2^{n}n!}\frac{d^{n + |m|}}{d\mu^{n + |m|}} (\mu^{2} - 1)^{n}. \tag{16.3}
$$

We may substitute equation (16.1) into the general equation of radiative transfer, equation (10.24),

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla_{\tau}I + I = (1 - \omega)I_{b} + \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I(\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})d\Omega^{\prime}, \tag{16.4}
$$

where space coordinates have been nondimensionalized using the extinction coefficient, i.e.,  $d\tau = \beta ds$  (as indicated by the subscript  $\tau$  in  $\nabla_{\tau}$ ). Equation (16.4) requires the outgoing intensity to be specified everywhere along the surface of the enclosure. Equation (16.4) is multiplied by  $Y_{k}^{n}$  after also expanding the scattering phase function into a series of Legendre polynomials, equation (12.99), followed by integration over all directions. Exploiting the orthogonality properties of spherical harmonics [6] leads to infinitely many coupled partial differential equations in the unknown position- dependent functions  $I_{l}^{m}(\mathbf{r})$ .4 Up to this point the above representation is an exact method for the determination of the intensity field. To simplify the problem an approximation is now made by truncating the series in equation (16.1) after very few terms. By doing so, we have replaced the single unknown  $I$  (which is a function of space and direction) by

![](images/c6ccbdfda6972fea90c2dd04dce943bef845acf476e416cba174fc0f4c18c507.jpg)  
FIGURE 16-1 Coordinates for the one-dimensional plane-parallel medium.

FIGURE 16- 1 Coordinates for the one- dimensional plane- parallel medium.

$1 + 3 + \dots +(2N + 1) = (N + 1)^2$  unknown  $I_{l}^{m}$  that are functions of space only. Therefore, we need to replace equation (16.4) (a function of space and direction) by  $(N + 1)^2$  equations (which are functions of space only). This is achieved by multiplying equation (16.4) by  $Y_{k}^{m}$  and integrating over all directions.

The highest value for  $l$  retained,  $N$ , gives the method its order and its name. Most often employed is the  $P_{1}$  or differential approximation  $(l = 0,1)$ , while the  $P_{3}$ - approximation  $(l = 0,1,2,3)$  has been used a few times. It is known from neutron transport theory that approximations of odd order are more accurate than even ones of next highest order, so that the  $P_{2}$  approximation is never used. In most early developments and applications the  $P_{N}$ - method was derived only for the one- dimensional plane- parallel case, for example, as in Jeans [1], Kourganoff [2], and Krook [7]. Detailed derivations of the general three- dimensional case in Cartesian coordinates have been given by Davison [3] and by Cheng [8,9]. The extension to general coordinate systems has been given by Ou and Liou [10]. Another general three- dimensional derivation has been given by Condiff [11], who expanded the intensity in terms of polyadic Legendre polynomials given by Brenner [12], that is, Legendre functions  $P_{n}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})$  whose arguments are tensors of order  $n$  (rather than scalars). And, recently, Modest and Yang [13], have formulated the general three- dimensional  $P_{N}$ - approximation for Cartesian geometries in terms of elliptic second- order partial differential equations, which are readily incorporated into standard CFD codes.

# 16.3 THE  $P_{N}$ -APPROXIMATION FOR A ONE-DIMENSIONAL SLAB

We shall now develop the general  $P_{N}$ - method in some detail for the one- dimensional plane- parallel medium, in order to (i) shed further light on the general method, and (ii) facilitate the difficult problem of developing a consistent set of boundary conditions. For such a simple case the intensity does not depend on azimuthal angle  $\psi$  (assuming the polar angle  $\theta$  is measured from an axis perpendicular to the plates, as shown in Fig. 16- 1), i.e.,  $I_{l}^{m} = 0$  for  $m\neq 0$ . Thus, equation (16.1) may be simplified to

$$
I(\tau ,\mu)\simeq \sum_{l = 0}^{N}I_{l}(\tau)P_{l}(\mu), \tag{16.5}
$$

where we set  $\mu = \cos \theta$  and omitted the superscript  $0$  from  $I_{l}$  since it is no longer necessary. Equation (16.5) is approximate because the series is truncated beyond  $l = N$ , i.e., we assume  $I_{l}(\tau) = 0$  for all  $l > N$ . The scattering phase function for such a medium, expanded into Legendre polynomials, is [see equation (14.12)]

$$
\Phi (\mu ,\mu^{\prime}) = \sum_{m = 0}^{M}A_{m}P_{m}(\mu^{\prime})P_{m}(\mu), \tag{16.6}
$$

where  $M$  is the order of approximation for the phase function; and we find

$$
\int_{-1}^{1}\Phi (\mu ,\mu^{\prime})I(\tau ,\mu^{\prime})d\mu^{\prime} = \sum_{l = 0}^{N}I_{l}(\tau)\sum_{m = 0}^{M}A_{m}P_{m}(\mu)\int_{-1}^{1}P_{l}(\mu^{\prime})P_{m}(\mu^{\prime})d\mu^{\prime}. \tag{16.7}
$$

We may now utilize the orthogonality of Legendre polynomials (see, for example, Abramowitz and Stegun [14]), to write

$$
\int_{-1}^{1}P_{l}(\mu)P_{m}(\mu)d\mu = \frac{2\delta_{lm}}{2m + 1} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0 & \mathrm{for}m\neq l\\ \displaystyle 2m + 1 & \mathrm{for}m = l. \end{array} \right. \tag{16.8}
$$

Employing this orthogonality relation in equation (16.7) leads to

$$
\int_{-1}^{1}\Phi (\mu ,\mu^{\prime})I(\tau ,\mu^{\prime})d\mu^{\prime} = \sum_{l = 0}^{N}\frac{2A_{l}}{2l + 1} I_{l}(\tau)P_{l}(\mu), \tag{16.9}
$$

where it is implied that  $A_{l} = 0$  for  $l > M$ . (On the other hand, if  $M > N$ , the  $A_{l}$  for  $l = N + 1,\ldots ,M$  disappear and this information about the phase function is lost in the  $N$ th order approximation.) We may now recast the equation of transfer for the one- dimensional plane- parallel medium as

$$
\mu \frac{dI}{d\tau} +I(\tau) = (1 - \omega)I_{b}(\tau) + \frac{\omega}{2}\int_{-1}^{1}\Phi (\mu ,\mu^{\prime})I(\tau ,\mu^{\prime})d\mu^{\prime}, \tag{16.10}
$$

or

$$
\sum_{l = 0}^{N}\left[\frac{dI_l}{d\tau}\mu P_l(\mu) + I_l(\tau)P_l(\mu)\right] = (1 - \omega)I_b(\tau) + \omega \sum_{l = 0}^{N}\frac{A_lI_l(\tau)}{2l + 1} P_l(\mu). \tag{16.11}
$$

To exploit the orthogonality of the Legendre polynomials, we shall use the recursion relation [14]

$$
(2l + 1)\mu P_l(\mu) = lP_{l - 1}(\mu) + (l + 1)P_{l + 1}(\mu). \tag{16.12}
$$

Thus, we may recast equation (16.11) as

$$
\sum_{l = 0}^{N}\left\{\frac{I_l^{\prime}(\tau)}{2l + 1}\left[IP_{l - 1}(\mu) + (l + 1)P_{l + 1}(\mu)\right] + I_l(\tau)P_l(\mu)\right\} = (1 - \omega)I_b(\tau) + \sum_{l = 0}^{N}\frac{\omega A_lI_l(\tau)}{2l + 1} P_l(\mu), \tag{16.13}
$$

where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to  $\tau$ . Since we have introduced  $(N + 1)$  new variables,  $I_{0},I_{1},\ldots ,I_{N}$ , we need to convert equation (16.13) into  $(N + 1)$  equations independent of direction. Thus, multiplying by  $P_{k}(\mu)$ $(k = 0,1,\ldots ,N)$  and integrating over all  $\mu$  leads to

$$
\frac{k + 1}{2k + 3} I_{k + 1}^{\prime}(\tau) + \frac{k}{2k - 1} I_{k - 1}^{\prime}(\tau) + \left(1 - \frac{\omega A_k}{2k + 1}\right)I_k(\tau) = (1 - \omega)I_b(\tau)\delta_{0k},\\ k = 0,1,\ldots ,N, \tag{16.14}
$$

where equation (16.8) has been utilized. Equation (16.14) is a set of  $(N + 1)$  simultaneous first- order ordinary differential equations for the unknown functions  $I_{0}(\tau),I_{1}(\tau),\ldots ,I_{N}(\tau)$ . As such it requires a set of  $(N + 1)$  boundary conditions for its solution.

# 16.4 BOUNDARY CONDITIONS FOR THE  $P_{N}$ -METHOD

The equation of radiative transfer, equation (16.4), is a first- order partial differential equation in intensity, requiring a boundary condition of the type

$$
I(\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_w(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}})\quad \mathrm{for}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} >0 \tag{16.15}
$$

FIGURE 16-2 Prescribed boundary intensities for  $P_{N}$ -method.

everywhere on the surface, that is, the intensity leaving a surface (described by the vector  $\mathbf{r}_w$ ) must be prescribed in some fashion for all outgoing directions  $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} > 0$  (with  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$  being the outward surface normal), as shown in Fig. 16- 2.

When the  $P_{N}$ - approximation is applied [truncating equation (16.1) after  $l = N$ ] this boundary condition can no longer be satisfied and must be replaced by one that either satisfies equation (16.15) at selected directions  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  or satisfies it in an integral sense. Mark [15, 16] and Marshak [17] proposed two different sets of boundary conditions for the spherical harmonics method as applied to neutron transport within a one- dimensional plane- parallel medium.

# Mark's Boundary Condition

For a one- dimensional slab of optical thickness  $\tau_{L}$ , equation (16.15) may be rewritten as

$$
\begin{array}{rlr} & {} & {I(0,\mu) = I_{w1}(\mu),\qquad 0< \mu < 1,}\\ & {} & {I(\tau_L,\mu) = I_{w2}(\mu),\qquad -1< \mu < 0,} \end{array} \tag{16.16b}
$$

where  $I_{w1}$  and  $I_{w2}$  are the prescribed intensities at Surfaces 1  $(\tau = 0)$  and 2  $(\tau = \tau_{L})$ .<sup>6</sup>

The  $P_{N}$ - method for such a medium, equation (16.14), requires  $(N + 1)$  boundary conditions, say  $\frac{1}{2} (N + 1)$  each, at  $\tau = 0$  and  $\tau = \tau_{L}$  (assuming that  $N$  is odd). Noting that the equation

$$
P_{N + 1}(\mu) = 0 \tag{16.17}
$$

has precisely  $\frac{1}{2} (N + 1)$  roots  $\mu_i$  with values between 0 and 1, Mark suggested replacing the boundary conditions of equation (16.16) by

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{I(0,\mu = \mu_i) = I_{w1}(\mu_i),} & {i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{1}{2} (N + 1),}\\ {I(\tau_L,\mu = -\mu_i) = I_{w2}(-\mu_i),} & {i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{1}{2} (N + 1),} \end{array} \tag{16.18b}
$$

where the  $\mu_i$  are the positive roots of equation (16.17). A detailed explanation for this choice has been given by Mark [15, 16] and by Davison [3]. For example, for the  $P_{1}$ - approximation for a medium bounded by black walls we get with  $P_{2}(\mu) = \frac{1}{2} (3\mu^{2} - 1)$ ,  $\mu_{1} = 1 / \sqrt{3}$  and, from equation (16.5),

$$
\begin{array}{c}{I\left(0,\mu = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = I_0(0) + \frac{I_1(0)}{\sqrt{3}} = I_{b1},}\\ {I\left(\tau_L,\mu = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\right) = I_0(\tau_L) - \frac{I_1(\tau_L)}{\sqrt{3}} = I_{b2}.} \end{array} \tag{16.19b}
$$

One serious drawback of Mark's boundary conditions is the fact that they are difficult, if not impossible, to apply to more complicated geometries.

# Marshak's Boundary Conditions

An alternative set of boundary conditions for the one- dimensional plane- parallel  $P_N$ - approximation was proposed by Marshak, who suggested that equation (16.16) be satisfied in an integral sense by setting

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}\int_0^1 I(0,\mu)P_{2i - 1}(\mu)d\mu = \int_0^1 I_{w1}(\mu)P_{2i - 1}(\mu)d\mu , & i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{1}{2} (N + 1);\\ \displaystyle \int_{-1}^0 I(\tau_L,\mu)P_{2i - 1}(\mu)d\mu = \int_{-1}^0 I_{w2}(\mu)P_{2i - 1}(\mu)d\mu , & i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{1}{2} (N + 1). \end{array} \tag{16.20b}
$$

Again, the reason for choosing all the Legendre polynomials of odd order has been explained in detail by Marshak [17] and Davison [3]. Substituting equation (16.5) and assuming diffuse surfaces, i.e.,  $I_w = J_w / \pi$ , leads to

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}\sum_{l = 0}^{N}I_{l}(0)\int_{0}^{1}P_{l}(\mu)P_{2i - 1}(\mu)d\mu = \frac{J_{w1}}{\pi}\int_{0}^{1}P_{2i - 1}(\mu)d\mu , & i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{1}{2} (N + 1);\\ \displaystyle \sum_{l = 0}^{N}I_{l}(\tau_{L})\int_{-1}^{0}P_{l}(\mu)P_{2i - 1}(\mu)d\mu = \frac{J_{w2}}{\pi}\int_{-1}^{0}P_{2i - 1}(\mu)d\mu , & i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{1}{2} (N + 1). \end{array} \tag{16.21b}
$$

As an example we again consider the  $P_1$ - approximation for a medium bounded by black walls. Then, with  $P_1(\mu) = \mu$ ,

$$
\int_0^1 I(0,\mu)\mu d\mu = \int_0^1 [I_0(0) + I_1(0)\mu ]\mu d\mu = \int_0^1 I_{b1}\mu d\mu ,
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{r}I_0(0) + \frac{2}{3} I_1(0) = I_{b1},\\ I_0(\tau_L) - \frac{2}{3} I_1(\tau_L) = I_{b2}. \end{array} \tag{16.22b}
$$

We note that replacing the factor 2 in Marshak's boundary condition by a  $\sqrt{3}$  converts it to Mark's boundary condition.

One advantage of Marshak's boundary condition is that it may be extended to more general problems, although not painlessly. Note that the integration in equation (16.20) is carried out over all directions above the surface (i.e., a hemisphere) with the Legendre polynomials of equation (16.5) as weight factors. Thus, it appears natural to generalize the boundary condition to (see Fig. 16- 2)

$$
\begin{array}{r}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} >0}I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}})\overline{Y}_{2i - 1}^m (\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega = \int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} >0}I_w(\hat{\mathbf{s}})\overline{Y}_{2i - 1}^m (\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega ,\\ i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{1}{2} (N + 1),\quad \mathrm{all~relevant~}m, \end{array} \tag{16.23}
$$

where the  $\overline{Y}_{2i - 1}^m (\hat{\mathbf{s}})$  are expressed in terms of a local coordinate system, in which polar angle  $\theta '$  is measured from the surface normal (i.e.,  $\cos \theta ' = \hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}$ ), and azimuthal angle  $\psi '$  is measured on the surface, as indicated in Fig. 16- 2. The statement "all relevant  $m''$  rather than  $- i \leq m \leq +i$  appears in equation (16.23) since it may provide more boundary conditions than are required. For example, for a one- dimensional plane- parallel medium there is no azimuthal dependence,

![](images/46ccbd711ca0e9ad26a73c1c3c9872ed9d0d2527e719fc541b3c4a990707cc8c.jpg)  
FIGURE 16-3 Geometry for Example 16.1.

so that all  $I_{n}^{m}$  with  $m\neq 0$  vanish. and the only "relevant" value for  $m$  is  $m = 0$  .This leads to a single boundary condition on each surface for the  $P_{1}$  - approximation (as already seen to be correct), two for the  $P_{3}$  - approximation, and so on. Generally, equation (16.23) leads to too many boundary conditions in multidimensional situations. For example, for the  $P_{1}$  - approximation for a general three- dimensional medium without symmetry, equation (16.23) leads to three boundary conditions everywhere  $(i = 1,m = 0,\pm 1)$  , while only one is needed (as explained in the following section). Davison [3] has shown that the number of superfluous conditions is always at least one less than the possible  $m$  at  $\begin{array}{r}i = \frac{1}{2} (N + 1) \end{array}$  . Thus, on intuitive grounds it was accepted practice to satisfy equation (16.23) for all  $m$  for  $i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{1}{2} (N - 1),$  and for as many relevant  $m$  as possible for  $i = \frac{1}{2} (N + 1)$  . Recently, Modest [18] has shown that a self- consistent set of boundary conditions is obtained if, for  $\begin{array}{r}i = \frac{1}{2} (N + 1), \end{array}$  only the even values for  $m$  are chosen, discarding all odd  $m$

Example 16.1. Consider the infinite quarter- space  $\tau_{x} > 0,\tau_{z} > 0$  bounded by isothermal black surfaces at  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$  as shown in Fig. 16- 3. Develop the boundary conditions for the  $P_{1}$  - approximation at both surfaces (i.e.,  $\tau_{x} = 0$  and  $\tau_{z} = 0$  -

# Solution

For the  $P_{1}$  - approximation equation (16.1) reduces to

$$
I(\tau_{x},\tau_{z},\theta ,\psi) = I_{0}^{0}(\tau_{x},\tau_{z}) - I_{1}^{-1}(\tau_{x},\tau_{z})\sin \psi P_{1}^{-1}(\cos \theta) + I_{1}^{0}(\tau_{x},\tau_{z})P_{1}^{0}(\cos \theta) + I_{1}^{1}(\tau_{x},\tau_{z})\cos \psi P_{1}^{1}(\cos \theta).
$$

For this two- dimensional problem it is convenient to measure polar angle  $\theta$  from the  $\tau_{z}$  - axis, and azimuthal angle  $\psi$  in the  $\tau_{x} - \tau_{y}$  - plane from the  $\tau_{x}$  - axis. Then  $I(\psi) = I(- \psi)$  and, with  $P_{1}^{0}(\cos \theta) = \cos \theta ,$  and  $P_{1}^{1} = P_{1}^{- 1}(\cos \theta) = - \sin \theta ,$

$$
I(\tau_{x},\tau_{y},\theta ,\psi) = I_{0}^{0} + I_{1}^{0}\cos \theta -I_{1}^{1}\cos \psi \sin \theta ,
$$

since the term involving  $\sin \psi$  must vanish owing to symmetry. Therefore, equation (16.23) is able to provide two boundary conditions everywhere on the surface  $(i = 1$  and  $m = 0,1)$  , while we need only one (as to be developed in the next section). Thus, following the discussion of equation (16.23), we introduce local direction coordinate systems on the surfaces and satisfy equation (16.23) only for  $m = 0$  For the bottom surface,  $\tau_{z} = 0,$  the problem is simple since the surface normal is parallel to the  $\tau_{z}$  - axis, from which the polar angle is measured. Thus,

$$
\int_{\psi = 0}^{2\pi}\int_{\theta = 0}^{\pi /2}\left(I_0^0 +I_1^0\cos \theta -I_1^1\cos \psi \sin \theta\right)\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\psi = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi /2}I_{b1}\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\psi ,
$$

or

$$
I_0^0 (\tau_x,0) + \textstyle \frac{2}{3} I_1^0 (\tau_x,0) = I_{b1}.
$$

At the vertical surface  $(\tau_{x} = 0)$ $P_{1}^{0} = \cos \theta^{\prime}$  , where  $\theta^{\prime}$  is the angle between a direction vector and the surface normal  $\hat{\mathbf{n}} = \hat{\mathbf{1}}$  .Thus, with cos  $\theta^{\prime} = \hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{1}}$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \sin \theta (\cos \psi \hat{\mathbf{1}} +\sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{1}}) + \cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{k}},$  it follows that cos  $\theta^{\prime} = \sin \theta \cos \psi$  and

$$
\int_{\psi = -\pi /2}^{\pi /2}\int_{\theta = 0}^{\pi}\Big(I_0^0 +I_1^0\cos \theta -I_1^1\cos \psi \sin \theta \Big)\sin \theta \cos \psi \sin \theta d\theta d\psi = \pi \Big(I_0^0 -\frac{2}{3} I_1^1\Big) = \pi I_{b2},
$$

or

$$
I_0^0 (0,\tau_x) - \textstyle \frac{2}{3} I_1^1 (0,\tau_x) = I_{b2}.
$$

We shall see in the next section that  $I_0^0$  is directly proportional to incident radiation, while  $I_1^0$  and  $I_1^1$  are proportional to radiative heat flux into the  $\tau_{y}$  - and  $\tau_{x}$  - directions, respectively.

Davison [3] stated that for low- order approximations Marshak's boundary conditions would give superior results, but that for high- order approximations Mark's boundary conditions should be more accurate. However, subsequent numerical work by Pellaud [19] and Schmidt and Gelbard [20] showed Marshak's boundary condition leads to more accurate results, even in high- order approximations.

# 16.5 THE  $P_{1}$  -APPROXIMATION

If the series in equation (16.1) is truncated beyond  $l = 1$  (i.e.,  $I_{l}^{m}\equiv 0$  for  $l\geq 2$  ), we get the lowest- order, or  $P_{1},$  approximation, or

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_0^0 Y_0^0 +I_1^{-1}Y_1^{-1} + I_1^0 Y_1^0 +I_1^1 Y_1^1. \tag{16.24}
$$

From standard mathematical texts, such as MacRobert [21], or directly from equation (16.3) we find the associated Legendre polynomials as  $P_0^0 = 1,P_1^0 = \cos \theta ,P_1^1 = P_1^{- 1} = - \sin \theta ,$  and, using equation (16.2),

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\theta ,\psi) = I_0^0 +I_1^0\cos \theta +I_1^{-1}\sin \theta \sin \psi -I_1^1\sin \theta \cos \psi . \tag{16.25}
$$

We notice that equation (16.25) has four terms: The first term is independent of direction, the second is proportional to the  $\Xi$  - component of the direction vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \sin \theta \cos \psi \hat{\mathbf{1}} +\sin \theta \sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{1}} +$  cos  $\theta \hat{\mathbf{k}},$  the third is proportional to  $s_{y}$  and the last to  $s_{x}$  7 Each term is preceded by an unknown function of the space coordinates, which are to be determined. Equation (16.25) may be written more compactly by introducing two new functions,  $a$  (a scalar) and  $\mathbf{b}$  (a vector having three components) as

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = a(\mathbf{r}) + \mathbf{b}(\mathbf{r})\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}. \tag{16.26}
$$

The four unknowns-  $\mathcal{a}$  and the three components of  $\mathbf{b},$  or the four components of  $I_{n}^{m}$  can be related to physical quantities. Substituting equation (16.26) into the definition for incident radiation yields

$$
G(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{4\pi}I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega = a(\mathbf{r})\int_{4\pi}d\Omega +\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{r})\cdot \int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = 4\pi a(\mathbf{r}), \tag{16.27}
$$

since

$$
\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}\left( \begin{array}{c}\sin \theta \cos \psi \\ \sin \theta \sin \psi \\ \cos \theta \end{array} \right)\sin \theta d\theta d\psi = \left( \begin{array}{c}0\\ 0\\ 0 \end{array} \right) = \mathbf{0}. \tag{16.28}
$$

Similarly, substituting equation (16.26) into the definition for the radiative heat flux gives

$$
\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{4\pi}I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = a(\mathbf{r})\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega +\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{r})\cdot \int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = \frac{4\pi}{3}\mathbf{b}(\mathbf{r}), \tag{16.29}
$$

since

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}\left( \begin{array}{ccc}\sin^{2}\theta \cos^{2}\psi & \sin^{2}\theta \sin \psi \cos \psi & \sin \theta \cos \theta \cos \psi \\ \sin^{2}\theta \sin \psi \cos \psi & \sin^{2}\theta \sin^{2}\psi & \sin \theta \cos \theta \sin \psi \\ \sin \theta \cos \theta \cos \psi & \sin \theta \cos \theta \sin \psi & \cos^{2}\theta \end{array} \right)\times \sin \theta d\theta d\psi}\\ & {\quad \quad = \int_{0}^{\pi}\left( \begin{array}{ccc}\pi \sin^{2}\theta & 0 & 0\\ 0 & \pi \sin^{2}\theta & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 2\pi \cos^{2}\theta \end{array} \right)\sin \theta d\theta}\\ & {\quad \quad = \frac{4\pi}{3}\left( \begin{array}{ccc}1 & 0 & 0\\ 0 & 1 & 0\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array} \right) = \frac{4\pi}{3}\delta ,} \end{array} \tag{16.30}
$$

where  $\delta$  is the unit tensor, and  $\mathbf{b} \cdot \delta = \mathbf{b}$ . Therefore, we may rewrite equation (16.26) in terms of incident radiation and radiative heat flux as

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \frac{1}{4\pi} [G(\mathbf{r}) + 3\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{r})\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} ]. \tag{16.31}
$$

We find that, except for a constant factor,  $I_0^0$  is the incident radiation, while  $I_1^1, I_1^{- 1}$ , and  $I_1^0$  are the  $x$ ,  $y$ - , and  $z$ - components of the radiative heat flux, respectively. The preceding development is useful to show that equation (16.31) indeed corresponds to the lowest order of the  $P_N$ - approximation, equation (16.1). Of course, equation (16.31) should have physical significance and it should be possible to derive it from physical principles. This was done by Modest [22], who treated radiation as a "photon gas" with momentum and energy, and derived the intensity field through quantum statistics. He showed that the average photon velocity (which is proportional to heat flux) is inversely proportional to optical thickness, and that equation (16.31) holds for a location a large optical distance away from any points not at thermodynamic equilibrium (sharp temperature gradients, steps in temperature, etc.).

Now, substituting equation (16.31) into equation (16.4) and assuming linear- anisotropic scattering, $^8$

$$
\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}) = 1 + A_{1}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}, \tag{16.32}
$$

leads to

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{{\int_{4\pi}I(\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\Phi(\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})d\Omega^{\prime}=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}(G+3\mathbf{q}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})(1+A_{1}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})d\Omega^{\prime}}}\\ &{}&{=\frac{G}{4\pi}\left[\int_{4\pi}d\Omega^{\prime}+A_{1}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}d\Omega^{\prime}\right]+\frac{3\mathbf{q}}{4\pi}\cdot\left[\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}d\Omega^{\prime}+A_{1}\left(\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}d\Omega^{\prime}\right)\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}}\right]}\\ &{}&{=G+A_{1}\mathbf{q}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}}=G+A_{1}\mathbf{q}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{s}},\qquad(16.33)}\end{array} \tag{16.33}
$$

where equations (16.28) and (16.30) have been employed (and the last step is easily verified by, say, using Cartesian coordinates and carrying out the dot product). Thus, equation (16.4)

becomes

$$
\frac{1}{4\pi}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot [\hat{\mathbf{s}} (G + 3\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}})] + \frac{1}{4\pi} (G + 3\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}})\simeq (1 - \omega)I_{b} + \frac{\omega}{4\pi} (G + A_{1}\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}), \tag{16.34}
$$

where we were able to pull the direction vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  inside the gradient, since direction is independent of position. Multiplying equation (16.34) by  $Y_0^0 = 1$  and integrating over all solid angles gives

$$
\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \mathbf{q} = (1 - \omega)(4\pi I_{b} - G), \tag{16.35}
$$

where again equations (16.28) and (16.30) have been invoked. Equation (16.35) is, of course, identical to equation (10.59) since it does not depend on the functional form for intensity.

To obtain additional equations we may multiply equation (16.34) by  $Y_{1}^{m}$ $(m = - 1,0, + 1)$  or equivalently, by the components of the direction vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ . Choosing the latter and integrating over all directions leads to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\frac{1}{4\pi}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \left[G\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega +3\mathbf{q}\cdot \int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega \right] + \frac{1}{4\pi}\left[G\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega +3\mathbf{q}\cdot \int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega \right]}\\ {= (1 - \omega)I_{b}\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega +\frac{\omega}{4\pi}\left[G\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega +A_{1}\mathbf{q}\cdot \int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega \right].} \end{array} \tag{16.36}
$$

It is easy to show that  $\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = 0$  (and, indeed, the integral over any odd multiple of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ ) and, therefore, this equation reduces to

or

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\frac{1}{3}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot (G\delta) + \mathbf{q}\cdot \delta = \frac{\omega A_1}{3}\mathbf{q}\cdot \delta ,}\\ {}\\ {\nabla_{\tau}G = -(3 - A_1\omega)\mathbf{q}.} \end{array} \tag{16.37}
$$

Equations (16.35) and (16.37) are a complete set of one scalar and one vector equation in the unknowns  $G$  and  $\mathbf{q}$ , and are the governing equations for the  $P_{1}$  or differential approximation. The heat flux may be eliminated from these equations by taking the divergence of equation (16.37) after dividing by  $(1 - A_{1}\omega /3)$ :

$$
\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{1 - A_{1}\omega / 3}\nabla_{\tau}G\right) = -3\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \mathbf{q} = -3(1 - \omega)(4\pi I_{b} - G). \tag{16.38}
$$

If  $A_{1}\omega$  is constant (does not vary across the volume) this equation reduces to

$$
\nabla_{\tau}^{2}G - (1 - \omega)(3 - A_{1}\omega)G = -(1 - \omega)(3 - A_{1}\omega)4\pi I_{b}. \tag{16.39}
$$

Equation (16.39) is a Helmholtz equation, closely related to Laplace's equation, and is elliptic in nature (see, for example, a standard mathematics text such as Pipes and Harvill [23]). As such, it requires a single boundary condition specified everywhere on the enclosure surface.

If radiative equilibrium prevails, then  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = 0$ , and

$$
\nabla_{\tau}^{2}G = 0, \tag{16.40}
$$

or

$$
\nabla_{\tau}^{2}I_{b} = 0. \tag{16.41}
$$

In either case we get the elliptic Laplace's equation with the same boundary condition requirements. Once the incident radiation and/or blackbody intensity has been determined, the radiative heat flux is found from equation (16.37) as

$$
\mathbf{q} = -\frac{1}{3 - A_1\omega}\nabla_{\tau}G. \tag{16.42}
$$

Equation (16.23) can supply three boundary conditions for the  $P_{1}$ - approximation, while equations (16.39) or (16.40) only require a single one. Thus, following the discussion of Marshak's boundary condition, equation (16.23), we choose only the case of  $m = 0$  for the weight function in equation (16.23), with polar angle measured from the surface normal. Thus,

$$
\overline{\Upsilon}_1^0 (\hat{\mathbf{q}}) = P_1^0 (\cos \theta ') = \cos \theta ' = \hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}, \tag{16.43}
$$

where  $\theta^{\prime}$  is the polar angle of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  in the local coordinate system as shown in Fig. 16- 2. Physically, that is, without reference to the general  $P_{N}$ - approximation, this choice of boundary condition implies that the directional distribution of the outgoing intensity along the enclosure wall is satisfied in an integral sense, by requiring the normal heat flux to be continuous (from enclosure surface into the participating medium). Then the boundary condition becomes

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} >0}I_w(\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} d\Omega = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} >0}^{\pi /2}(G + 3\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} d\Omega}\\ {= \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{\psi ' = 0}^{2\pi}\int_{\theta ' = 0}^{\pi /2}\bigl (G + 3q_{t1}\sin \theta '\cos \psi ' + 3q_{t2}\sin \theta '\sin \psi ' + 3q_{t1}\cos \theta '\bigr)\cos \theta '\sin \theta 'd\theta}\\ {= \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{\pi /2}(G + 3q_{n}\cos \theta ')\cos \theta '\sin \theta 'd\theta ' = \frac{1}{4} (G + 2q_{n})} \end{array}
$$

or

$$
G + 2\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = 4\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} >0}I_w(\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} d\Omega . \tag{16.44}
$$

Here  $q_{t1}$  and  $q_{t2}$  are the two components of the heat flux vector tangential to the surface and  $q_{n} = \mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}$  is the normal component.

For an opaque surface which emits and reflects radiation diffusely,  $I_{w}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = J_{w} / \pi$ , where  $J_{w}$  is the surface's radiosity. Substituting this into equation (16.44) leads to

$$
G + 2\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \frac{4}{\pi} J_w\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi /2}\cos \theta '\sin \theta 'd\theta 'd\psi ' = 4J_w. \tag{16.45}
$$

Recalling equation (5.26),

$$
\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \frac{\epsilon}{1 - \epsilon}\left(\pi I_{bw} - J_w\right), \tag{16.46}
$$

equation (16.44) finally becomes

$$
2\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = 4J_w - G = \frac{\epsilon}{2 - \epsilon} (4\pi I_{bw} - G), \tag{16.47}
$$

where  $\epsilon$  is the local surface emittance. Modest [22] has shown that equation (16.47) also holds if the surface reflectance consists of purely diffuse and purely specular components, i.e., if

$$
\epsilon = 1 - \rho^d -\rho^s. \tag{16.48}
$$

Thus, within the accuracy of the  $P_{1}$ , or differential, approximation, the results for enclosures with diffusely and/or specularly reflecting surfaces are identical. Since equation (16.39) is a second- order equation in  $G$ , it is of advantage to eliminate  $\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}$  from the boundary condition using equation (16.42). Thus,

$$
-\frac{2 - \epsilon}{\epsilon}\frac{2}{3 - A_1\omega}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \nabla_\tau G + G = 4\pi I_{bw} \tag{16.49}
$$

is the correct boundary condition to go with equation (16.38) or (16.39). Equation (16.49) is known as a boundary condition of the third kind (since it incorporates both the dependent variable and its normal gradient). Appendix F provides subroutine P1sor for the solution to this system for a two- dimensional (rectangular or axisymmetric- cylindrical) enclosure.

# Summary of the  $P_{1}$ -Approximation

For convenience we will summarize here the pertinent equations and boundary conditions that constitute the  $P_{1}$ - approximation for a medium bounded by diffuse, gray walls. This can be done in two ways: (i) simultaneous first- order PDEs in incident radiation and radiative heat flux, or (ii) a single elliptic second- order PDE in incident radiation. The former is the preferred formulation for the case of radiative equilibrium in a gray medium; the latter is more useful if the temperature field is known (or must be found through iteration).

# Simultaneous Equations:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = \kappa (4\pi I_b - G), \tag{16.50a}
$$

$$
\nabla G = -(3\beta -A_1\sigma_s)\mathbf{q}, \tag{16.50b}
$$

$$
\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_w:\qquad 2\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = 4J_w - G = \frac{\epsilon}{2 - \epsilon} (4\pi I_{bw} - G). \tag{16.50c}
$$

Incident Radiation Formulation:

$$
\begin{array}{c}\frac{1}{3\kappa}\nabla \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\beta - A_1\sigma_s / 3}\nabla G\right) - G = -4\pi I_b,\\ \displaystyle \mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_w:\qquad -\frac{2 - \epsilon}{\epsilon}\frac{2}{3\beta - A_1\sigma_s}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \nabla G + G = 4\pi I_{bw}, \end{array} \tag{16.51b}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{q} = -\frac{1}{3\beta - A_1\sigma_s}\nabla G. \tag{16.52}
$$

Example 16.2. Consider an isothermal, gray slab at temperature  $T$  and of optical thickness  $\tau_{L}$ , bounded by two isothermal black surfaces at temperature  $T_{w}$ . The medium scatters linear- anisotropically. Determine an expression of the nondimensional heat flux as a function of the optical parameters.

# Solution

Since the temperature field is given we use the incident radiation formulation, and we may write equation (16.39) or equation (16.51a) as

or

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\frac{d^2G}{d\tau^2} -(1 - \omega)(3 - A_1\omega)G = -(1 - \omega)(3 - A_1\omega)4n^2\sigma T^4,}\\ {}\\ {G(\tau) = C_1\cosh \gamma \tau +C_2\sinh \gamma \tau +4n^2\sigma T^4,} \end{array}
$$

where

$$
\gamma = \sqrt{(1 - \omega)(3 - A_1\omega)}.
$$

Because of the symmetry of the problem it is advantageous to place the origin at the center of the slab, i.e.,  $- \tau_{L} / 2 \leq \tau \leq +\tau_{L} / 2$ . Then

$$
\frac{dG}{d\tau} (\tau = 0) = 0 = \gamma C_1\sinh (\gamma \times 0) + \gamma C_2\cosh (\gamma \times 0) + 0,
$$

or  $C_{2} = 0$ . Applying equation (16.49) [or (16.51b)] at  $\tau = \tau_{L} / 2$ , with  $\epsilon = 1$ , we get

$$
\frac{2}{3 - A_1\omega}\frac{dG}{d\tau} (\tau_L / 2) + G(\tau_L / 2) = 4n^2\sigma T_w^4,
$$

or

$$
\frac{2\gamma}{3 - A_1\omega} C_1\sinh \frac{1}{2}\gamma \tau_L + C_1\cosh \frac{1}{2}\gamma \tau_L + 4n^2\sigma T^4 = 4n^2\sigma T_w^4,
$$

$$
C_1 = -\frac{4n^2\sigma(T^4 - T_w^4)}{\cosh\frac{1}{2}\gamma\tau_L + 2\sqrt{\frac{1 - \omega}{3 - A_1\omega}}\sinh\frac{1}{2}\gamma\tau_L},
$$

$$

The heat flux is determined from equation (16.42) as

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{n^2\sigma(T^4 - T_w^4)} = -\frac{1}{n^2\sigma(T^4 - T_w^4)}\frac{1}{3 - A_1\omega}\frac{dG}{d\tau} = \frac{2\sinh\gamma\tau}{\sinh\frac{1}{2}\gamma\tau_L + \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{3 - A_1\omega}{1 - \omega}}\cosh\frac{1}{2}\gamma\tau_L}.

Some sample results for the heat flux at the wall  $(\tau = \tau_{L} / 2)$  are given in Fig. 16- 4. We note that in this case the  $P_{1}$ - approximation goes to the correct optically thin limit  $\Psi \to 4\tau /\tau_{L}$  (emission, but no self- absorption of emission), but not to the correct optically thick limit (since, as a result of the temperature step at the wall, there will always be an intensity discontinuity at the wall). In fact, for this problem the results of the  $P_{1}$ - approximation are worst (in absolute magnitude) close to that location.

Example 16.3. Let us look at a gray medium at radiative equilibrium placed between two black concentric cylinders of radius  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$  that are isothermal at temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ . For simplicity, we shall assume that the medium does not scatter  $(\sigma_{s} = 0)$ , and that its absorption coefficient,  $\kappa$ , is constant. We desire to find the heat flux from inner to outer cylinder as a function of the ratio  $R_{1} / R_{2}$  and the optical thickness of the medium,  $\tau_{12} = \tau_{2} - \tau_{1} = \kappa (R_{2} - R_{1})$ .

# Solution

For one- dimensional radiative equilibrium problems such as this, it is advantageous to use the simultaneous equation formulation, equations (16.50a) and (16.50b). Then, from equation (16.50a) we have, in cylindrical coordinates (with  $\omega = 0$  and  $\tau = \kappa r$ ),

$$
\frac{1}{\tau}\frac{d}{d\tau} (\tau q) = 4n^2\sigma T^4 -G = 0.
$$

If we multiply by  $\tau$  and integrate, we find

$$
\tau q = C_1\quad \mathrm{or}\quad q = \frac{C_1}{\tau}.
$$

Substituting this expression into equation (16.37) gives

$$
\frac{dG}{d\tau} = -3q = -\frac{3C_1}{\tau},
$$

$$
G = -3C_{1}\ln \tau +C_{2}.
$$

The boundary conditions are, from equation (16.47) with  $\epsilon = 1$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{rl}\tau = \tau_1: & 2\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = 2q = 4n^2\sigma T_1^4 -G,\\ \tau = \tau_2: & 2\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = -2q = 4n^2\sigma T_2^4 -G, \end{array}
$$

from which  $C_1$  and  $C_2$  may be determined as

$$
C_1 = \frac{4n^2\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)}{\frac{2}{\tau_1} + \frac{2}{\tau_2} + 3\ln\frac{\tau_2}{\tau_1}},\quad C_2 = 4n^2\sigma T_2^4 +C_1\left(\frac{2}{\tau_2} +3\ln \tau_2\right).
$$

Heat flux and temperature then follow as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\Psi = \frac{q}{n^2\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = \frac{2}{1 + \frac{\tau_2}{\tau_1} + \frac{3}{2}\tau_2\ln\frac{\tau_2}{\tau_1}}\left(\frac{\tau_2}{\tau_1}\right),\\ \Phi = \frac{T^4 - T_2^4}{T_1^4 - T_2^4} = \frac{1 + \frac{3}{2}\tau_2\ln\frac{\tau_2}{\tau}}{1 + \frac{\tau_2}{\tau_1} + \frac{3}{2}\tau_2\ln\frac{\tau_2}{\tau_1}}. \end{array}
$$

The resulting nondimensional heat flux,  $\Psi$ , evaluated at the inner cylinder, is shown in Fig. 16- 5 for the case of  $R_2 / R_1 = 2$  together with exact results (Table 14.4), results from the diffusion approximation with jump boundary condition (Example 15.3) and results from the  $P_1$ - approximation given by Bayazitoglu and Higenyi [24]. As expected, the  $P_1$ - approximation does well for optically thick media. For the optically thin case, however, as  $\kappa \to 0$  the heat flux goes to

$$
\Psi_{1}\rightarrow \frac{2}{1 + R_{2} / R_{1}}\frac{R_{2}}{R_{1}} = 2\bigg / \bigg(1 + \frac{R_{1}}{R_{2}}\bigg),
$$

while the correct answer should be  $\Psi_1 \to 1$ , as we know from Chapter 5, equation (5.35). Therefore, for  $R_1 / R_2 \to 1$  the correct optically thin limit is obtained (and the gap between such cylinders becomes a plane- parallel slab), while for small inner cylinders,  $R_1 / R_2 \ll 1$ , the error becomes larger and may be as large as 100%!

The  $P_1$ - approximation is a very popular method since it reduces the (spectral or gray) equation of transfer from a very complicated integral equation to a relatively simple partial differential equation, e.g., [25- 37]. The method is powerful (allowing nonblack surfaces, nonconstant

properties, anisotropic scattering, etc.), and the average heat transfer engineer is much better trained in solving differential equations than integral equations. Furthermore, if overall energy conservation (also a partial differential equation) is computed, compatibility of the solution methods is virtually assured. However, it is important to remember that the  $P_{1}$ - approximation may be substantially in error in optically thin media with strongly anisotropic intensity distributions, in particular in multidimensional geometries with large aspect ratios (i.e., long and narrow configurations) and/or when surface emission dominates over medium emission. Attempts to improve the method's accuracy, by modifying Marshak's boundary condition, were made by Liu and coworkers [38] and by Su [39]. In one- dimensional geometries accuracy can also be improved by applying the  $P_{1}$ - approximation separately to different solid angle ranges, as done by Mengüç and Subramaniam [40]. Most of the shortcomings of the  $P_{1}$ - approximation are overcome by the modified differential approximation discussed in Section 16.8 below.

# 16.6  $P_{3}$ -AND HIGHER-ORDER APPROXIMATIONS

The general  $P_{N}$ - approximation for one- dimensional absorbing/emitting, and anisotropically scattering cylindrical media has been given by Kofink [41], and the  $P_{3}$ - approximation for one- dimensional slabs, concentric cylinders, and concentric spheres has been developed in terms of moments by Bayazitoglu and Higenyi [24]. Higher- order solutions, up to  $P_{11}$ , for a gray, anisotropically scattering medium between concentric spheres have been considered by Tong and Swathi [42] (uniform heat generation) and by Li and Tong [43] (isothermal medium). One- dimensional fibrous material was considered by Tong and Li [44] and a packed bed by Wu and Chu [45].

For multidimensional geometries, the process described in equations (16.11) through (16.14) can also be carried out in three dimensions, as outlined by Davison [3], resulting in a set of  $(N + 1)^2$  simultaneous, first- order partial differential equations in the unknown  $I_{n}^{m}$ . The general  $P_{N}$ - formulation for three- dimensional Cartesian coordinate systems has been derived by Cheng [8, 9], including Marshak's boundary conditions for surfaces normal to one of the coordinates. A three- dimensional problem was solved by Park and coworkers, analyzing radiative equilibrium in a rectangular box filled with a gray, nonscattering medium [26]. Mengüç and Viskanta [46, 47] limited their development to the  $P_{3}$ - approximation in terms of moments (rather than spherical harmonics), but considered three- dimensional Cartesian coordinates [46] as well as axisymmetric cylindrical geometries [47]. The three- dimensional  $P_{N}$ - approximation for arbitrary coordinate systems has been derived by Ou and Liou [10]. With the exception of Cheng [8], no boundary conditions beyond a reference to equation (16.23) have been given in these publications.

Recently, Modest and coworkers [13,18,48] outlined a methodology that reduces the  $(N + 1)^2$  simultaneous equations of the standard  $P_{N}$ - formulation to  $N(N + 1) / 2$  simultaneous, second- order elliptic partial differential equations for a given odd order  $N$ , allowing for variable properties, anisotropic scattering, and arbitrary three- dimensional geometries. They further showed how to extract a completely defined, self- consistent set of boundary conditions from equation (16.23). The analysis is very tedious, to say the least, and we will present here only the final result for the (somewhat simpler) case of isotropic scattering. Defining a second- order operator

$$
\mathcal{L}_{xy} = \frac{1}{\beta}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{1}{\beta}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\right), \tag{16.53}
$$

etc., and eliminating spherical harmonics coefficients  $I_{n}^{m}$  of odd order  $n$ , leads to the following set of second- order PDEs:

Local and global coordinates for a two- dimensional enclosure.

the constants for  $k = 1$  and 3 undergo only minor changes, but for  $k = 2$  [involving two different anisotropy constants  $A_{m}$  from equation (16.6)] the operators become nonsymmetric.

Since the orientation of the Cartesian coordinate system is arbitrary, one would expect to see equation (16.54) to show similar operators in  $x$ ,  $y$ , and  $z$ . The reason that this is not the case is that the global direction angles  $(\theta , \psi)$  and, thus, the results for  $I_{n}^{m}$  are tied to the choice of the coordinate system, i.e., we may write

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \sum_{n}^{N}\sum_{m = -n}^{n}I_{n}^{m}(\mathbf{r})Y_{n}^{m}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \sum_{n}^{N}\sum_{m = -n}^{n}\bar{I}_{n}^{m}(\mathbf{r})\overline{Y}_{n}^{m}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}), \tag{16.55}
$$

where the barred values refer to a rotated coordinate system  $(x, y, z)$ .

Example 16.4. Consider an isothermal medium at temperature  $T$ , confined inside a two- dimensional enclosure as shown in Fig. 16- 6. The medium is gray and absorbs and emits, but does not scatter. Determine the set of governing equations for the  $P_{3}$ - approximation.

# Solution

For a two- dimensional problem with polar angle  $\theta$  measured from the  $\mathcal{Z}$  - axis we must have  $I(\theta ,\psi) =$ $I(\pi - \theta ,\psi)$  , i.e., all  $I_{n}^{m}$  , for which the accompanying associated Legendre polynomials  $P_{n}^{m}(\cos \theta)$  have an odd- power dependence on cos  $\theta_{j}$  must vanish. This is the case whenever  $n + m$  is odd. Therefore,  $I_{n}^{m} = 0$  for  $n + m =$  odd and, since the governing equations are cast in terms of even  $n$  terms with odd  $m$  in equations (16.54) vanish. Using this, and eliminating all terms with  $\mathcal{Z}$  - derivatives, we get from equations (16.54)

$$
\begin{array}{rlr} & {Y_0^0:(\mathcal{L}_{xx} - \mathcal{L}_{yy})e_1^{00}I_2^0 +(\mathcal{L}_{xy}^0 +\mathcal{L}_{yx})e_1^{00}I_2^{-2} + (\mathcal{L}_{xx} + \mathcal{L}_{yy})c_1^{00}I_2^0 +(\mathcal{L}_{xx}^0 +\mathcal{L}_{yy})c_2^{00}I_0^0 -I_0^0 = -I_b,}\\ & {Y_2^0:(\mathcal{L}_{xx} - \mathcal{L}_{yy})e_2^{20}I_2^2 +(\mathcal{L}_{xy}^0 +\mathcal{L}_{yx})e_2^{20}I_2^{-2} + (\mathcal{L}_{xx} + \mathcal{L}_{yy})c_2^{20}I_2^0 +(\mathcal{L}_{xx}^0 +\mathcal{L}_{yy})c_3^{20}I_0^0 -I_2^0 = 0,}\\ & {Y_2^2:(\mathcal{L}_{xx} - \mathcal{L}_{yy})2a_2^{22}I_2^0 +(\mathcal{L}_{xx}^0 +\mathcal{L}_{yy})c_2^{22}I_2^2 +(\mathcal{L}_{xx}^0 -\mathcal{L}_{yy})2a_3^{22}I_0^0 -I_2^2 = 0,}\\ & {Y_2^{-2}:(\mathcal{L}_{xy}^0 +\mathcal{L}_{yx})2a_2^{22}I_2^0 +(\mathcal{L}_{xx}^0 +\mathcal{L}_{yy})c_2^{22}I_2^{-2} + (\mathcal{L}_{xy}^0 +\mathcal{L}_{yx})2a_3^{22}I_0^0 -I_0^{-2} = 0.} \end{array}
$$

For  $n = 0$  the case of  $k = 3$  is not needed, since this leads to nonexistent  $I_{2}^{m}$ , and, similarly, for  $n = 2$  the case of  $k = 1$ , producing  $I_{4}^{m}$ , i.e., terms omitted in the  $P_{3}$ - approximation. In addition, all  $I_{n}^{m}$  with odd  $m$  and with  $m > n$  are dropped. Equations (16.54) are also valid for  $n = 2, m = \pm 1$ , but every term in these equations vanishes. Thus the above set constitutes the needed four equations for the four unknowns. The coefficients are evaluated from Table 16.1 as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{a_2^{22} = -\frac{1}{2\cdot 7\cdot 3} = -\frac{1}{22};a_3^{22} = \frac{1}{4\cdot 3\cdot 1} = \frac{1}{12};c_1^{00} = \frac{1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4}{4\cdot 5\cdot 3} = \frac{2}{5};c_2^{20} = -\frac{3\cdot 4\cdot 1\cdot 2}{2\cdot 7\cdot 3} = -\frac{4}{7};}\\ {c_1^{00} = -\frac{1\cdot 2}{2\cdot 5\cdot 3} = -\frac{1}{15};c_2^{00} = \frac{-1}{3\cdot (-1)} = \frac{1}{3};c_2^{20} = \frac{5}{7\cdot 3} = \frac{5}{21};c_2^{22} = \frac{9}{7\cdot 3} = \frac{3}{7};c_3^{20} = -\frac{1\cdot 2}{2\cdot 3\cdot 1} = -\frac{1}{3}.} \end{array}
$$

# Boundary Conditions

Equation set (16.54) consists of  $N(N + 1) / 2$  simultaneous, elliptic PDEs, requiring  $N(N + 1) / 2$  boundary conditions everywhere along the domain boundary, which must be determined from the general Marshak condition, equation (16.23). Unfortunately, equation (16.23) is cast in terms of a local coordinate system. Thus, in order to obtain a generic boundary condition for arbitrary geometries, the global spherical harmonics must be rotated into the local coordinate system. Such rotation, according to Euler's rotation theorem, may be described using three angles, which are called Euler angles. In the literature, there are several notation and rotation conventions for Euler angles. Here, the rotation  $(\alpha , \beta , \gamma)$  is used for three Euler angles following Varshalovich et al.'s definition [49]. In Varshalovich's convention, as shown in Fig. 16- 7, an arbitrary rotation is defined by Euler angles  $(\alpha , \beta , \gamma)$ , where the first rotation is by an angle  $\alpha$  about the  $z$ - axis, the second is by an angle  $\beta$  about the  $y'$ - axis, and the third is by an angle  $\gamma$  about the  $z'$ - axis. As indicated in Fig. 16- 7 all three rotations are, following the right- hand rule, in counterclockwise direction about the center axis. The three rotations can, in general, be carried out by (1) rotating  $x - y$  so that  $y'$  is perpendicular to  $\hat{\mathbf{n}} (\hat{\mathbf{n}}, \hat{\mathbf{y}} ') = 0$ ,

$$
\hat{\mathbf{r}}^{\prime} = \cos \alpha \hat{\mathbf{r}} +\sin \alpha \hat{\mathbf{r}},\quad \hat{\mathbf{y}}^{\prime} = -\sin \alpha \hat{\mathbf{r}} +\cos \alpha \hat{\mathbf{y}} \tag{16.57}
$$

and

$$
\tan \alpha = \frac{n_y}{n_x}, \tag{16.58}
$$

(2) rotating  $x' - z$  such that  $z'$  becomes parallel to  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$ , or

$$
\hat{\mathbf{k}}^{\prime} = \sin \beta \hat{\mathbf{r}}^{\prime} + \cos \beta \hat{\mathbf{k}} \tag{16.59}
$$

and  $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{k}} ' = 1$  gives

$$
(n_{x}\cos \alpha +n_{y}\sin \alpha)\sin \beta +n_{z}\cos \beta = 1. \tag{16.60}
$$

(3) The third rotation is arbitrary and serves to place the local  $\overline{x} -\overline{y}$ -coordinates into convenient locations.

Example 16.5. Determine the Euler angles for the local coordinate system for the boundary location indicated in Fig. 16- 6.

# Solution

To perform the transformation indicated in Fig. 16- 6 (with the global  $z$ - axis pointing toward the reader), the local surface normal is determined as

$$
\hat{\alpha} = -\sin \delta \hat{\mathbf{1}} +\cos \delta \hat{\mathbf{1}} +0\hat{\mathbf{1}}, \tag{16.61}
$$

and the first rotation angle  $\alpha$  follows from

$$
\tan \alpha = -\tan \delta ,\mathrm{or}\alpha = \delta \pm \frac{\pi}{2}. \tag{16.62}
$$

If we choose  $\alpha = \delta - \pi /2$  ( $\gamma^\prime$  points into the indicated  $\overline{x}$ - direction), the second rotation angle becomes

$$
\left[-\sin \delta \cos \left(\delta -\frac{\pi}{2}\right) + \cos \delta \sin \left(\delta -\frac{\pi}{2}\right)\right]\sin \beta = 1,\mathrm{or}\beta = \frac{3\pi}{2}. \tag{16.63}
$$

This has  $x^{\prime \prime}$  pointing out of the paper, and a final (optional) rotation of  $\gamma = \pi /2$  rotates  $x^{\prime \prime \prime}$  into the desired local  $\overline{x}$ - direction.

It can be shown that, for a given rotation, the spherical harmonics of order  $n$  are transformed into a linear combination of spherical harmonics of the same order  $n$ . Such an operation can be represented in the form of a rotation matrix, where each element of this matrix is a function of Euler angles,

$$
Y_{n}^{m^{\prime}}(\theta ,\phi) = \sum_{m = -n}^{n}\Delta_{mm^{\prime}}^{n}(\alpha ,\beta ,\gamma)Y_{n}^{m}(\theta ,\phi), \tag{16.64}
$$

where  $\Delta_{mm^{\prime}}^{n}(\alpha ,\beta ,\gamma)$  is the representation matrix of the rotation operation for the real spherical harmonics  $Y_{n}^{m}$  of order  $n$ . Blanco<sup>10</sup> et al. [50] developed a closed- form expression to specify all the elements based on so- called Wigner-  $D$  functions, from which the  $\Delta^{n}$  matrices can be obtained in terms of the Euler angles as

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\Delta_{mm^{\prime}}^{n} = \mathrm{sign}(m^{\prime})\Psi_{m}(\alpha)\Psi_{m^{\prime}}(\gamma)[d_{|m|,|m^{\prime}|}^{n}(\beta) + (-1)^{m^{\prime}}d_{|m|, - |m^{\prime}|}^{n}(\beta)]}\\ & {\qquad -\mathrm{sign}(m)\Psi_{-m}(\alpha)\Psi_{-m^{\prime}}(\gamma)[d_{|m|,|m^{\prime}|}^{n}(\beta) - (-1)^{m^{\prime}}d_{|m|, - |m^{\prime}|}^{n}(\beta)]} \end{array} \tag{16.65}
$$

where  $\mathrm{sign}(0) = 1$  and the function  $\Psi_{m}$  is defined as

$$
\Psi_{m}(\xi) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\cos m\xi , & \mathrm{for} m\geq 0,\\ \sin |m|\xi , & \mathrm{for} m< 0. \end{array} \right. \tag{16.66}
$$

To determine the  $\Delta^{n}$  matrices by equation (16.65) the  $d^{n}$  matrices are needed, which are modified versions of the real parts of the Wigner-  $D_{mm^{\prime}}^{n}$  functions, and may be calculated from

$$

$$

With the rotation of spherical harmonics between local and global coordinates as indicated by equation (16.64), relationships between  $I_{n}^{m}$  and  $\overline{I}_{n}^{m}$  can be revealed accordingly by expressing

intensity in terms of, both, local and global coordinates, as given by equation (16.55). This leads to

$$
I_{n}^{m} = \sum_{m^{\prime} = -n}^{n}\Delta_{mm^{\prime}}^{n}(\alpha ,\beta ,\gamma)I_{n}^{m^{\prime}},\mathrm{and}I_{n}^{m} = \sum_{m^{\prime} = -n}^{n}\bar{\Delta}_{mm^{\prime}}^{n}(-\gamma , - \beta , - \alpha)I_{n}^{m^{\prime}}, \tag{16.68}
$$

where the bar on the  $\bar{\Delta}_{mm^{\prime}}^{n}$  implies backward rotation from local to global coordinates, as indicated by the arguments. Substitution of equation (16.55) into (16.23), and assuming the surface intensity  $I_{w}$  to be diffuse, reduces the boundary conditions to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\sum_{n = 0}^{N}\left[\int_{0}^{1}P_{n}^{m}(\bar{\mu})P_{2i - 1}^{m}(\bar{\mu})d\bar{\mu}\right]\bar{I}_{n}^{m}(\tau_{w}) = \left[\int_{0}^{1}P_{2i - 1}(\bar{\mu})d\bar{\mu}\right]\delta_{m,0}I_{w},}\\ {i = 1,2,\dots, \frac{1}{2} (N + 1),\mathrm{all~e~e~e~v~a~n~t~}m.} \end{array} \tag{16.69}
$$

Before these boundary conditions can be applied to equations (16.54) the  $\bar{I}_{n}^{m}$  with odd  $n$  must be eliminated. Boundary conditions are usually formulated in terms of local normal and tangential gradients, and this leads to

In equations (16.70) and (16.72) it is implied that coefficients in front of nonsensical  $\overline{I}_n^m$  (i.e.,  $|m| > n)$  and  $p_{nj}^{m}$  with nonsensical subscripts  $(n< m)$  are zero. The  $p_{n,j}^{m}$  may be determined through recursion relationships [18] and are listed in Table 16.2 (scaled by a factor of  $10^{- m}$  ) for up to the  $P_{5}$  - approximation.

It remains to rotate the  $\overline{I}_n^m$  in equations (16.70) to global values  $I_{n}^{m}$ , which results in

Equations (16.73) are a set of  $(N + 2)(N + 1) / 2$  boundary conditions for  $N(N + 1) / 2$  variables  $I_{2l}^{m}$ $(l = 0,1,\dots,(N - 1) / 2;m = - 2l,\dots, + 2l)$ , containing normal as well as tangential derivatives, or  $N + 1$  too many. Commercial PDE solvers generally allow for boundary conditions containing normal derivatives. In principle, i.e., if the coefficients in front of the  $I_{2l}^{m}$  inside the normal derivatives form a nonsingular matrix, linear combination of the boundary conditions leads to a set of "natural" boundary conditions for each variable, or

$$
\begin{array}{r}\frac{\partial I_{2l}^{m}}{\partial\tau_{\overline{z}}} = f\left(I_{2l'}^{m'};\frac{\partial I_{2l'}^{m'}}{\partial\tau_{\overline{z}}};I' = 0,\dots \frac{1}{2} (N - 1);m' = -2l',\dots, + 2l'\right),\\ l = 0,\dots,\frac{1}{2} (N - 1),m = -2l',\dots, + 2l, \end{array} \tag{16.74}
$$

which can be used with FlexPDE [51] and other commercial programs. Modest [18] has shown that such a nonsingular matrix can be found only if, for the largest value of  $i = \frac{1}{2} (N + 1)$ , only the even values of  $m$  are employed (omitting the  $N + 1$  odd values). Therefore, the qualifier "all relevant  $m^{\prime \prime}$  in equations (16.69), (16.70), and (16.73) may be restated precisely as

$$
\mathrm{All~relevant}m = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}i = 1,2,\dots,\frac{1}{2} (N - 1), & \mathrm{all}m,\\ i = \frac{1}{2} (N + 1), & \mathrm{all}evenm, \end{array} \right. \tag{16.75}
$$

which supplies a consistent set of  $N(N + 1) / 2$  boundary conditions for an equal number of variables.

Other codes, such as PDE2D [52] or FDEM [53], use derivatives in global coordinates in the boundary conditions. In that case, the transformation to global  $I_{n}^{m}$  using equation (16.68) is carried out first, followed by elimination of odd orders. The resulting boundary conditions are given in [13].

Example 16.6. Determine the necessary boundary conditions for the problem of Example 16.4 for the surface location indicated in Fig. 16- 6. The surface is black and at temperature  $T_{w}$ .

# Solution

The boundary conditions are usually expressed in terms of local coordinates (i.e., in terms of gradients into the surface normal and tangential directions), either using local spherical harmonics  $\overline{I}_n^m$ , equation (16.70), followed by rotation to global spherical harmonics  $I_{n}^{m}$ , or by directly applying equation (16.73). We will follow the first track here. With local azimuthal angle  $\overline{\psi}$  defined from the  $\overline{x}$ - axis in the  $\overline{x} - \overline{y}$ - plane, for this two- dimensional problem independent of  $\overline{y}$  we must have  $I(\overline{\theta},\overline{\psi}) = I(\overline{\theta}, - \overline{\psi})$  and, therefore, all  $\overline{I}_n^m$  with negative  $m$  vanish. Thus, from equation (16.70), eliminating all terms with negative  $m$  and  $\overline{y}$ - gradients, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl} & {\overline{Y}_1^0:} & {p_{01}^0\overline{I}_0^0 +p_{21}^0\overline{I}_2^0 +\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{\overline{x}}}\left[v_{11}^0\overline{I}_1^1\right]} & {-\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{\overline{z}}}\left[w_{01}^0\overline{I}_0^0 +w_{11}^0\overline{I}_2^0\right] = I_{bw}p_{01}^0,}\\ & {\overline{Y}_1^1:} & {p_{21}^1\overline{I}_2^1 -\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{\overline{x}}}\left[2u_{01}^1\overline{I}_0^0 +2u_{11}^1\overline{I}_2^0 -v_{11}^1\overline{I}_2^2\right] - \frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{\overline{z}}}\left[w_{11}^1\overline{I}_2^1\right]} & {= 0,}\\ & {\overline{Y}_3^0:} & {p_{03}^0\overline{I}_0^0 +p_{23}^0\overline{I}_2^0 +\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{\overline{x}}}\left[v_{12}^0\overline{I}_2^1\right]} & {-\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{\overline{z}}}\left[w_{02}^0\overline{I}_0^0 +w_{12}^0\overline{I}_2^0\right] = I_{bw}p_{03}^0,}\\ & {\overline{Y}_3^2:} & {p_{23}^2\overline{I}_2^2 -\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{\overline{x}}}\left[u_{12}^2\overline{I}_2^1\right]} & {-\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{\overline{z}}}\left[w_{12}^2\overline{I}_2^2\right]} & {= 0.} \end{array}
$$

The equations for  $\overline{Y}_1^{- 1}$  and  $\overline{Y}_3^{- 2}$  contain only  $\overline{I}_n^m$  with negative  $m$  and, thus, vanish identically, leaving us with the proper four boundary conditions for the four unknown  $\overline{I}_n^m$ . The coefficients  $p_{nj}^m, u_{li}^m, v_{li}^m$ , and  $w_{li}^m$

are found from Table 16.2 [or, more easily from program pnbc.s.f90 in Appendix F] as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{p_{01}^{0}=\frac{1}{2},p_{21}^{0}=\frac{1}{8},p_{21}^{1}=\frac{3}{4},p_{03}^{0}=-\frac{1}{8},p_{23}^{0}=\frac{1}{8},p_{23}^{2}=\frac{15}{2};}\\ {u_{01}^{1}=\frac{-p_{11}^{1}}{2\cdot 1}=-\frac{1}{3},u_{11}^{1}=\frac{p_{11}^{1}-p_{31}^{1}}{2\cdot 5}=\frac{1}{10}\left(\frac{2}{3}-0\right)=\frac{1}{15},u_{12}^{2}=\frac{p_{13}^{2}-p_{33}^{2}}{2\cdot 5}=\frac{1}{10}\left(0-\frac{120}{7}\right)=-\frac{12}{7};}\\ {v_{11}^{0}=\frac{2\cdot 3p_{11}^{0}-2\cdot 3p_{31}^{0}}{2\cdot 5}=\frac{3}{5}\left(\frac{1}{3}-0\right)=\frac{1}{5},v_{11}^{1}=\frac{3\cdot 4p_{11}^{1}-1\cdot 2p_{31}^{1}}{2\cdot 5}=\frac{1}{10}\left(12\times\frac{2}{3}-0\right)=\frac{4}{5},}\\ {v_{12}^{0}=\frac{2\cdot 3p_{13}^{0}-2\cdot 3p_{33}^{0}}{2\cdot 5}=\frac{3}{5}\left(0-\frac{1}{7}\right)=\frac{3}{35},}\\ {w_{01}^{0}=\frac{1\cdot p_{11}^{0}}{1}=\frac{1}{3},w_{11}^{0}=\frac{2p_{11}^{0}+3p_{31}^{0}}{5}=\frac{1}{5}\left(\frac{2}{3}-0\right)=\frac{2}{15},w_{11}^{1}=\frac{3p_{11}^{1}+2p_{31}^{1}}{5}=\frac{1}{5}\left(3\times\frac{2}{3}+0\right)=\frac{2}{5},}\\ {w_{02}^{0}=\frac{1\cdot p_{13}^{0}}{1}=0,w_{12}^{0}=\frac{2p_{13}^{0}+3p_{33}^{0}}{5}=\frac{1}{5}\left(0+\frac{3}{7}\right)=\frac{3}{35},w_{12}^{2}=\frac{4p_{13}^{2}+1\cdot p_{33}^{2}}{5}=\frac{1}{5}\left(0+\frac{120}{7}\right)=\frac{24}{7}.}\end{array}
$$

Therefore, after normalization with the leading term,

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}\overline{Y}_1^0:\overline{I}_0^0 +\frac{1}{4} I_2^0 +\frac{2}{5}\frac{\partial\overline{I}_2^1}{\partial\tau_{\overline{x}}} & -\frac{2}{3}\frac{\partial\overline{I}_0^0}{\partial\tau_{\overline{z}}} -\frac{4}{15}\frac{\partial\overline{I}_2^0}{\partial\tau_{\overline{z}}} = I_{bw},\\ \overline{Y}_1^1:\overline{I}_2^1 +\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{\overline{x}}}\left[\frac{8}{9} I_0^0 -\frac{8}{45} I_2^0 +\frac{16}{15} I_2^2\right] - \frac{8}{15}\frac{\partial\overline{I}_2^1}{\partial\tau_{\overline{z}}} & = 0,\\ \overline{Y}_3^0:\overline{I}_0^0 -\frac{24}{35}\frac{\partial\overline{I}_2^1}{\partial\tau_{\overline{x}}} & +\frac{24}{35}\frac{\partial\overline{I}_2^0}{\partial\tau_{\overline{z}}} & = I_{bw},\\ \overline{Y}_3^2:\overline{I}_2^2 +\frac{8}{35}\frac{\partial\overline{I}_2^1}{\partial\tau_{\overline{x}}} & -\frac{16}{35}\frac{\partial\overline{I}_2^2}{\partial\tau_{\overline{z}}} & = 0. \end{array} \tag{16.76d}
$$

Next, the local  $\overline{I}_n^m$  must be converted to global  $I_n^m$  with equation (16.68). For  $n = 0$  this simply gives  $\overline{I}_0^0 = I_0^0$ , i.e.,  $I_0^0$  is nondirectional and does not vary with rotation, and we will drop the unnecessary superscript from  $I_0$ . Remembering that, in global coordinates,  $I_n^m$  with odd  $m$  vanish (as opposed to negative  $m$  in local coordinates), for  $n = 2$  this leads to

$$
\begin{array}{r}\overline{I}_2^0 = \bar{\Delta}_{0, - 2}^2 I_2^{-2} + \bar{\Delta}_{0,0}^2 I_2^0 +\bar{\Delta}_{0,2}^2 I_2^2,\\ \overline{I}_2^1 = \bar{\Delta}_{1, - 2}^2 I_2^{-2} + \bar{\Delta}_{1,0}^2 I_2^0 +\bar{\Delta}_{1,2}^2 I_2^2,\\ \overline{I}_2^2 = \bar{\Delta}_{2, - 2}^2 I_2^{-2} + \bar{\Delta}_{2,0}^2 I_2^0 +\bar{\Delta}_{2,2}^2 I_2^2. \end{array}
$$

The necessary  $\bar{\Delta}_{m,m'}^2 (- \gamma = - \frac{\pi}{2}, - \beta = - \frac{3\pi}{2}, - \alpha = \frac{\pi}{2} - \delta)$  are determined via backward rotation from equation (16.65) with

$$
\Psi_{m}\Bigl (-\frac{\pi}{2}\Bigr) = \left\{ \begin{array}{c c c}{{-1,}} & {{m = 2}} & {{}}\\ {{0,}} & {{1}} & {{}}\\ {{1,}} & {{0}} & {{}}\\ {{-1,}} & {{-1}} & {{}}\\ {{0,}} & {{-2}} & {{}} \end{array} \right.,\quad \Psi_{m^{\prime}}\Bigl (\frac{\pi}{2} -\delta \Bigr) = \left\{ \begin{array}{c c c}{{-\cos 2\delta,}} & {{m^{\prime} = 2}} & {{}}\\ {{\sin \delta ,}} & {{1}} & {{}}\\ {{1,}} & {{0}} & {{}}\\ {{\cos \delta ,}} & {{-1}} & {{}}\\ {{\sin 2\delta ,}} & {{-2}} & {{}} \end{array} \right.,
$$

and  $\cos \left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right) = \sin \left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right) = \cos \left(- \frac{3\pi}{4}\right) = - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ . The  $d_{mm'}^2$  follow from equation (16.67) after some painful algebra (or, more easily, by manipulating program Delta. f90 in Appendix F). Finally,

$$
\begin{array}{l}\overline{I}_2^0 = -3\sin 2\delta I_2^{-2} - \frac{1}{2} I_2^0 -3\cos 2\delta I_2^2,\\ \displaystyle \overline{I}_2^1 = -2\cos 2\delta I_2^{-2} + 2\sin 2\delta I_2^2,\\ \displaystyle \overline{I}_2^2 = \frac{1}{2}\sin 2\delta I_2^{-2} - \frac{1}{4} I_2^0 +\frac{1}{2}\cos 2\delta I_2^2. \end{array}
$$

Sticking this into equation (16.76) delivers the desired local boundary conditions as

$$
\begin{array}{r l r} & {\overline{{Y}}_{1}^{0}:} & {I_{0} - \frac{3}{4}\sin 2\delta I_{2}^{-2} - \frac{1}{8} I_{2}^{0} - \frac{3}{4}\cos 2\delta I_{2}^{2} - \frac{4}{5}\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{x}}\left[\cos 2\delta I_{2}^{-2} - \sin 2\delta I_{2}^{2}\right]}\\ & {} & {-\frac{2}{15}\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{x}}\left[5I_{0} - 6\sin 2\delta I_{2}^{-2} - I_{2}^{0} - 6\cos 2\delta I_{2}^{2}\right] = I_{w},}\\ & {\overline{{Y}}_{1}^{1}:} & {-2\cos 2\delta I_{2}^{-2} + 2\sin 2\delta I_{2}^{2} + \frac{8}{45}\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{x}}\left[5I_{0} - I_{2} + 6\sin 2\delta I_{2}^{-2} + 6\cos 2\delta I_{2}^{2}\right]}\\ & {} & {+\frac{48}{45}\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{x}}\left[\cos 2\delta I_{2}^{-2} - \sin 2\delta I_{2}^{2}\right] = 0,}\\ & {\overline{{Y}}_{3}^{0}:} & {I_{0} + 3\sin 2\delta I_{2}^{-2} + \frac{1}{2} I_{2}^{0} + 3\cos 2\delta I_{2}^{2} - \frac{48}{35}\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{x}}\left[\cos 2\delta I_{2}^{-2} - \sin 2\delta I_{2}^{2}\right]}\\ & {} & {-\frac{24}{35}\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{x}}\left[3\sin 2\delta I_{2}^{-2} + \frac{1}{2} I_{2}^{0} + 3\cos 2\delta I_{2}^{2}\right] = I_{w},}\\ & {\overline{{Y}}_{3}^{2}:} & {\frac{1}{2}\sin 2\delta I_{2}^{-2} - \frac{1}{4} I_{2}^{0} + \frac{1}{2}\cos 2\delta I_{2}^{2} - \frac{16}{35}\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{x}}\left[\cos 2\delta I_{2}^{-2} - \sin 2\delta I_{2}^{2}\right]}\\ & {} & {-\frac{4}{35}\frac{\partial}{\partial\tau_{x}}\left[2\sin 2\delta I_{2}^{-2} - I_{2}^{0} + 2\cos 2\delta I_{2}^{2}\right] = 0.} \end{array}
$$

Once all  $I_{n}^{m}$  for even  $n$  have been determined, the remaining  $I_{n}^{m}$  (odd  $n$ ) may be determined from relations given in Modest and Yang [13]. Normally, only incident radiation  $G = 4\pi I_{0}$  and radiative flux are of interest, the latter being related to the  $I_{1}^{m}$ : comparing equations (16.24), (16.25), and (16.31) and noting that higher- order terms drop out because of the orthogonality of spherical harmonics [14], leads to

$$
{\bf q}({\bf r}) = \int_{4\pi}I({\bf r},{\bf \hat{s}}){\bf \hat{s}}d\Omega = \frac{4\pi}{3}\left( \begin{array}{c}{-I_{1}^{1}}\\ {-I_{1}^{-1}}\\ {I_{1}^{0}} \end{array} \right), \tag{16.77}
$$

where the  $I_{1}^{m}$  are given by [13]

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I_1^0 = -\frac{\partial I_0}{\partial\tau_z} -\frac{2}{5}\frac{\partial I_2^0}{\partial\tau_z} +\frac{3}{5}\frac{\partial I_2^1}{\partial\tau_x} +\frac{3}{5}\frac{\partial I_2^{-1}}{\partial\tau_y},}\\ {I_1^1 = +\frac{\partial I_0}{\partial\tau_x} -\frac{1}{5}\frac{\partial I_2^0}{\partial\tau_x} -\frac{3}{5}\frac{\partial I_2^1}{\partial\tau_z} +\frac{6}{5}\frac{\partial I_2^2}{\partial\tau_x} +\frac{6}{5}\frac{\partial I_2^{-2}}{\partial\tau_y},}\\ {I_1^{-1} = +\frac{\partial I_0}{\partial\tau_y} -\frac{1}{5}\frac{\partial I_2^0}{\partial\tau_y} -\frac{3}{5}\frac{\partial I_2^{-1}}{\partial\tau_z} -\frac{6}{5}\frac{\partial I_2^2}{\partial\tau_y} +\frac{6}{5}\frac{\partial I_2^{-2}}{\partial\tau_x}.} \end{array} \tag{16.78b}
$$

Since equation (16.1) is valid for any coordinate system orientation, equations (16.77) and (16.78) are valid for both the global coordinate system  $(x - y - z, I_{n}^{m})$  as well as a local coordinate system at a boundary  $(\overline{x} - \overline{y} - \overline{z}, I_{n}^{m})$ .

Finally, for nonblack surfaces the boundary radiosity  $J_{w} = \pi I_{w}$  must be related to the wall's emissive power and/or net radiative flux. From equations (16.1) and (16.77) we have

$$
q_{n} = \frac{\epsilon\pi}{1 - \epsilon} [I_{bw} - I_{w}] = \frac{4\pi}{3} I_{1}^{0}, \tag{16.79}
$$

where  $\epsilon$  is the surface's emittance, and with  $I_{1}^{0}$  transformed to global  $I_{1}^{m}$  through equation (16.68). If the temperature of the surface,  $T_{w}$ , is specified,  $I_{w}$  is determined from

$$
I_{w} = I_{bw} - \frac{4}{3}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} -1\right)I_{1}^{0}. \tag{16.80}
$$

For three- dimensional geometries, it is obvious that anything but low- order approximations quickly become extremely cumbersome to deal with. Already the  $P_{3}$ - approximation may result in as many as six simultaneous partial differential equations (depending on the symmetry), and it includes cross- derivatives, which do not ordinarily occur in engineering problems (and which complicate numerical solutions). In addition, complicated boundary conditions need to be developed from equation (16.73). As a result of this complexity, very few multidimensional problems have been solved by the  $P_{3}$ - approximation, and apparently none by higher orders. First results using the new elliptic formulation of equations (16.54) and (16.73) have been reported by Modest and coworkers [13, 18, 48]. We shall limit ourselves here to a simple example for a one- dimensional plane- parallel slab.

Example 16.7. Consider an isothermal medium at temperature  $T$ , confined between two large, parallel black plates that are isothermal at the (same) temperature  $T_{w}$ . The medium is gray and absorbs and emits, but does not scatter. Determine an expression for the heat transfer rates within the medium using the  $P_{3}$ - approximation. Employ the results from the previous three examples.

# Solution

For such a one- dimensional problem it is, generally, advantageous to choose  $\tau_{z}$  as the (nondimensional) space coordinate between the plates, as was done in Example 16.2, since this will make all  $I_{n}^{m}$  vanish with  $m\neq 0$ . However, for demonstrative purposes, and to utilize results from the previous three examples, we will choose the global coordinate system of Fig. 16- 6, i.e., the problem becomes one- dimensional in the  $y$ - direction, with the bottom surface corresponding to  $\delta = 0$ , and the top to  $\delta = \pi$ . Since now we have no  $x$ - dependence we must have  $I(\theta ,\psi) = I(\theta ,\pi - \psi)$ , which implies that we will not have any odd positive or even negative  $n$  terms in equation (16.56a). Together with  $n + m =$  even (no  $z$ - dependence) that reduces the set of equations developed in Example 16.4 to

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{Y_0^0:} & {\frac{d^2}{d\tau_y^2}\Big(\frac{2}{5} I_2^2 +\frac{1}{15} I_2^0 -\frac{1}{3} I_0\Big) + I_0 = I_b,}\\ {Y_2^0:} & {\frac{d^2}{d\tau_y^2}\Big(\frac{4}{7} I_2^2 +\frac{5}{21} I_2^0 -\frac{1}{3} I_0\Big) - I_2^0 = 0,}\\ {Y_2^2:} & {\frac{d^2}{d\tau_y^2}\Big(\frac{3}{7} I_2^2 +\frac{1}{21} I_2^0 -\frac{1}{6} I_0\Big) - I_2^2 = 0,} \end{array}
$$

and all terms vanish for the  $Y_{2}^{- 2}$ - equation, i.e., we now have three equations in three unknowns (since  $I_{2}^{- 2} = 0$ ).

To exploit the symmetry of the problem, we choose the origin for  $\tau_{y}$  to be at the midpoint between the two plates. Then the first derivatives of all three unknowns will be zero at the midpoint:

$$
\tau_{y} = 0:\quad \frac{dI_{0}}{d\tau_{y}} = \frac{dI_{2}^{0}}{d\tau_{y}} = \frac{dI_{2}^{2}}{d\tau_{y}} = 0.
$$

The necessary second set of boundary conditions follows from Example 16.6 with  $\delta = 0$  at  $\tau_{y} = - \tau_{L} / 2$  (and  $\tau_{L}$  is the total optical thickness of the medium) as

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{\overline{Y}_1^0:} & {I_0 - \frac{1}{8} I_2^0 -\frac{3}{4} I_2^2 -\frac{2}{15}\frac{d}{d\tau_y}\left[5I_0 - I_2^0 -6I_2^2\right] = I_{w0},}\\ {\overline{Y}_3^0:} & {I_0 + \frac{1}{2} I_2^0 +3I_2^2 -\frac{12}{35}\frac{d^4}{d\tau_y}\left[I_2^0 +6I_2^2\right]} & {= I_{w0},}\\ {\overline{Y}_3^2:} & {-\frac{1}{4} I_2^0 +\frac{1}{2} I_2^2 +\frac{4}{35}\frac{d^4}{d\tau_y}\left[I_2^0 -2I_2^2\right]} & {= 0,} \end{array}
$$

with all terms in the  $\overline{Y}_{1}^{1}$  boundary condition vanishing. While the given set of three simultaneous ordinary differential equations in  $I_{0}, I_{2}^{0}$ , and  $I_{2}^{2}$ , together with their boundary conditions, can be solved as they are, we do know from Section 16.3 that, for a one- dimensional problem, there should be only

a single  $I_{n}^{m}$  for every  $n$  (i.e.,  $I_{n}^{0}$ ). Inspecting the governing equations and boundary conditions, we find that  $I_{2}^{0}$  and  $I_{2}^{2}$  always occur in one of two combinations, viz.

$$
\begin{array}{c}{I_2 = -\frac{1}{2}\left(I_2^0 +6I_2^2\right),}\\ {K_2 = I_2^0 -2I_2^2,} \end{array}
$$

where the factor  $- \frac{1}{2}$  was included for convenience (i.e.,  $I_{2}$  just so happens to be  $I_{2}^{0}$  for the case that the  $z$ - axis points from plate to plate). Then

$$
\begin{array}{c}{Y_0^0:}\\ {-\frac{1}{15} I_2'' - \frac{1}{3} I_0'' + I_0 = I_b,}\\ {Y_2^0 +6Y_2^2: - \frac{11}{21} I_2'' - \frac{2}{3} I_0'' + I_2 = 0,}\\ {Y_2^0 -2Y_2^2:}\frac{1}{7} K_2'' - K_2 = 0,} \end{array}
$$

where the primes have been introduced as shorthand for  $d / d\tau_{y}$ . The boundary conditions at  $\tau_{y} = - \tau_{L} / 2$  follow as

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{\overline{Y}_1^0:} & {I_0 + \frac{1}{4} I_2 - \frac{2}{3} I_0' - \frac{4}{15} I_2' = I_{bw},}\\ {\overline{Y}_3^0:} & {I_0 - I_2} & {+\frac{24}{35} I_2' = I_{bw},}\\ {\overline{Y}_3^2:} & {\frac{1}{2} K_2} & {+\frac{4}{35} K_2' = 0.} \end{array}
$$

It follows that  $K_{2} \equiv 0$ , since both its governing equation and its boundary conditions are homogeneous.  $I_{2}$  can be eliminated from the remaining equations: first we eliminate  $I_{2}^{\prime}$  from the first two equations, leading to

or

$$
\begin{array}{c}{-\frac{9}{55} I_0^{\prime \prime} + I_0 - \frac{14}{55} I_2 = I_b,}\\ {}\\ {I_2 = -\frac{9}{14} I_0^{\prime \prime} + \frac{55}{14} (I_0 - I_b).} \end{array}
$$

Differentiating twice and eliminating  $I_{2}^{\prime \prime}$  from the  $Y_{0}^{0}$  equation, we obtain

$$
\frac{3}{35} I_0^{(iv)} - \frac{6}{7} I_0^{\prime \prime} + I_0 = I_b.
$$

The general solution to the above equation (keeping in mind that  $I_{b} = \mathrm{const}$ ) is

$$
I_{0}(\tau_{y}) = I_{b} + (I_{bw} - I_{b})[C_{1}\cosh \lambda_{1}\tau_{y} + C_{2}\cosh \lambda_{2}\tau_{y} + C_{3}\sinh \lambda_{1}\tau_{y} + C_{4}\sinh \lambda_{2}\tau_{y}],
$$

where the constant factor  $(I_{bw} - I_{b})$  was included to make the  $C_{i}$  dimensionless. The  $\lambda_{1}$  and  $\lambda_{2}$  are the positive roots of the equation

$$
\frac{3}{35}\lambda^4 -\frac{6}{7}\lambda^2 +1 = 0,
$$

or  $\lambda_{1} = 1.1613$  and  $\lambda_{2} = 2.9413$ . With  $\tau_{y} = 0$  placed at the midpoint between the two plates  $I_{0}^{\prime}(0) = I_{0}^{\prime \prime \prime}(0) = 0$  and  $C_{3} = C_{4} = 0$ . The two needed boundary conditions at one of the plates, say at  $\tau = - \tau_{L} / 2$ , are found by again eliminating  $I_{2}$ , or

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}\overline{Y}_1^0: & I_0 + \frac{1}{4}\left[-\frac{9}{14} I_0'' + \frac{55}{14} (I_0 - I_b)\right] - \frac{2}{3} I_0' - \frac{4}{15}\left[-\frac{9}{14} I_0'' + \frac{55}{14} I_0'\right] = I_{bw},\\ \overline{Y}_3^0: & I_0 & -\left[-\frac{9}{14} I_0'' + \frac{55}{14} (I_0 - I_b)\right] & +\frac{24}{35}\left[-\frac{9}{14} I_0'' + \frac{55}{14} I_0'\right] = I_{bw}, \end{array}
$$

leading to

$$
I_{bw} - I_{b} = \frac{111}{56} (I_{0} - I_{b}) - \frac{12}{7} I_{0}^{\prime \prime} - \frac{9}{56} I_{0}^{\prime \prime \prime} + \frac{6}{35} I_{0}^{\prime \prime \prime \prime},
$$

$$
I_{bw} - I_{b} = -\frac{41}{14} (I_{0} - I_{b}) + \frac{132}{49} I_{0}^{\prime} + \frac{9}{14} I_{0}^{\prime \prime} - \frac{108}{245} I_{0}^{\prime \prime \prime \prime}.
$$

Now, substituting the solution for  $I_{0}$  into these boundary conditions leads to

$$
1 = a_{1}C_{1} + a_{2}C_{2} = b_{1}C_{1} + b_{2}C_{2},
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{l}{a_i = \Big(\frac{111}{56} -\frac{9}{56}\lambda_i^2\Big)\cosh \lambda_i\frac{\tau_i}{2} +\Big(\frac{12}{7}\lambda_i - \frac{6}{35}\lambda_i^3\Big)\sinh \lambda_i\frac{\tau_L}{2},\quad i = 1,2,}\\ {b_i = -\Big(\frac{11}{74} -\frac{9}{14}\lambda_i^2\Big)\cosh \lambda_i\frac{\tau_L}{2} -\Big(\frac{132}{49}\lambda_i - \frac{108}{245}\lambda_i^3\Big)\sinh \lambda_i\frac{\tau_L}{2},\quad i = 1,2.} \end{array}
$$

Finally, we get

$$
C_1 = \frac{b_2 - a_2}{a_1b_2 - a_2b_1},\qquad C_2 = \frac{a_1 - b_1}{a_1b_2 - a_2b_1}.
$$

The heat flux through the medium is determined from equations (16.77) and (16.78) as

$$
q(\tau_{y}) = -\frac{4\pi}{3} I_{1}^{-1} = -\frac{4\pi}{3}\left(\frac{\partial I_{0}}{\partial\tau_{y}} -\frac{1}{5}\frac{\partial I_{2}^{0}}{\partial\tau_{y}} -\frac{6}{5}\frac{\partial I_{2}^{2}}{\partial\tau_{y}}\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{3}\left(\frac{\partial I_{0}}{\partial\tau_{y}} +\frac{2}{5}\frac{\partial I_{2}}{\partial\tau_{y}}\right).
$$

Substituting for  $I_{2}$  we obtain

$$
q(\tau_{y}) = -\frac{4\pi}{3}\left(I_{0}^{\prime} - \frac{9}{35} I_{0}^{\prime \prime \prime} + \frac{11}{7} I_{0}^{\prime}\right),
$$

and the heat flux may be expressed in nondimensional form as

$$
\Psi = \frac{q(\tau_y)}{n^2\sigma((T_w^4 - T^4)} = -\frac{12}{35}\frac{10I_0' - I_0'''}{I_{bw} - I_b} = -\frac{12}{35}\sum_{i = 1}^{2}(10\lambda_i - \lambda_i^3)C_i\sinh \lambda_i\tau_y,
$$

where, for simplicity, it was assumed that the medium is gray, or  $I_{b} = n^{2}\sigma T^{4} / \pi$

The nondimensional heat flux at the top surface  $(\tau_{y} = \tau_{L} / 2)$  is shown in Fig. 16- 8, as a function of optical depth of the slab. The results are compared with those of the  $P_{1}$  or differential approximation (Example 16.2), and with the exact result,

$$
\Psi = 1 - 2E_{3}(\tau_{L}),
$$

which is readily found from equation (14.35). For this particular example the  $P_{1}$ - approximation is very accurate (maximum error  $\sim 15\%$ ) and, as to be expected, the  $P_{3}$ - approximation performs even better (maximum error  $\sim 7\%$ ).

It should be clear from the above example that  $P_{3}$ - and higher- order  $P_{N}$ - approximations quickly become very tedious, even for simple geometries. However,  $P_{3}$  results can be substantially more accurate than  $P_{1}$  results, particularly in optically thin media and/or geometries with large aspect ratios. Another example, shown in Fig. 16- 5, depicts nondimensional heat flux through a gray, nonscattering medium at radiative equilibrium, confined between infinitely long, concentric, black and isothermal cylinders, in which the  $P_{3}$ - solution of Bayazitoglu and Higenyi [24] is compared with the  $P_{1}$ - solution (Example 16.3). Observe that the  $P_{3}$ - approximation introduces roughly half the error of the  $P_{1}$ - method, which appears to be approximately true for all problems. One outstanding advantage of the  $P_{3}$ - method is that, once the problem has been formulated (setting up the governing equations suitable for a numerical solution), the increase in computer time required (compared with the  $P_{1}$ - method) is relatively minor. In addition,  $P_{3}$ - calculations are also usually very grid- compatible with conduction/convection calculations, if one must account for combined modes of heat transfer. Three additional two- dimensional examples will be presented in the final section of this chapter, comparing results from different orders and different schemes of the spherical harmonics method.

# 16.7 SIMPLIFIED  $P_{N}$ -APPROXIMATION

As noted in the previous section, higher- order  $P_{N}$ - formulations for anything but one- dimensional slabs become extremely cumbersome mathematically, and they also introduce cross- derivatives, which make a numerical solution considerable more involved. Facing these mathematical difficulties Gelbard [5] introduced the Simplified  $P_{N}$ - Approximation some 50 years ago, as an intuitive three- dimensional extension to the one- dimensional slab  $P_{N}$ - formulation, equation (16.14), and its Marshak boundary conditions, equations (16.21). Gelbard formulated his set of simplified-  $P_{N}$  or  $SP_{N}$  equations, such that they reduced to the standard  $P_{N}$ - approximation for a one- dimensional slab and some other narrow circumstances, but the method lacked any theoretical foundation, which impeded its acceptance. Theoretical justifications were found many years later by Larsen et al. [54] (showing  $SP_{N}$  to be an asymptotic correction to the diffusion approximation of Section 15.2) and by Pomraning [55] (showing the  $SP_{N}$  to be asymptotically related to the  $P_{N}$ - equations for the slab geometry). A fine review of the  $SP_{N}$ - method has recently been given by McClarran [56].

While the developments of Larsen and Pomraning provide theoretical credentials to the method, they are rather tedious, and we will here only provide the intuitive development of Gelbard, further developed for radiative heat transfer applications by Modest [57]. Depending on whether  $k$  is odd or even, Gelbard made the following substitutions in equations (16.14) and (16.21):

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl} & {k\mathrm{odd}:} & & {I_k(\tau)\to \mathbf{I}_k(\tau_x,\tau_y,\tau_z),} & & {I_k' = \frac{dI_k}{d\tau}\to \nabla_\tau \cdot \mathbf{I}_k,}\\ & {k\mathrm{even}:} & & {I_k(\tau)\to I_k(\tau_x,\tau_y,\tau_z),} & & {I_k' = \frac{dI_k}{d\tau}\to \nabla_\tau I_k,} \end{array} \tag{16.81b}
$$

i.e., for every odd  $k$  the  $I_{k}$  becomes a vector and differentiation is replaced by the divergence operator, while even  $I_{k}$  remain scalars and their differentiation is replaced by the gradient operator. Substituting equations (16.81) into equation (16.14) leads to

$$
\begin{array}{ll}{k = 0,2,\ldots ,N - 1} & {\mathrm{(even):}\qquad \frac{k + 1}{2k + 3}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \mathbf{I}_{k + 1} + \frac{k}{2k - 1}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \mathbf{I}_{k - 1} + \alpha_kI_k = \alpha_kI_b\delta_{0k},}\\ {} & {}\\ {k = 1,3,\ldots ,N} & {\mathrm{(odd):}\qquad \frac{k + 1}{2k + 3}\nabla_{\tau}I_{k + 1} + \frac{k}{2k - 1}\nabla_{\tau}I_{k - 1} + \alpha_k\mathbf{I}_k = 0,} \end{array} \tag{16.82b}
$$

where

$$
\alpha_{k} = 1 - \frac{\omega A_{k}}{2k + 1}. \tag{16.82c}
$$

Solving equation (16.82b) for  $\mathbf{I}_k$  and substituting the result into (16.82a) produces a set of simultaneous elliptic partial differential equations in the unknown scalars  $I_{k}$  (k even):

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & k = 0,2,\ldots ,N - 1\quad (\mathrm{even}):\\ & \quad \frac{(k + 1)(k + 2)}{(2k + 3)(2k + 5)}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{\alpha_{k + 1}}\nabla_{\tau}I_{k - 2}\right) + \frac{(k + 1)^2}{(2k + 3)(2k + 1)}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{\alpha_{k + 1}}\nabla_{\tau}I_{k}\right)\\ & \quad +\frac{k^2}{(2k - 1)(2k + 1)}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{\alpha_{k - 1}}\nabla_{\tau}I_{k}\right) + \frac{k(k - 1)}{(2k - 1)(2k - 3)}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{\alpha_{k - 1}}\nabla_{\tau}I_{k - 1}\right) = \alpha_{k}(I_{k} - I_{b}\delta_{0k}). \end{array} \tag{16.83}
$$

Similarly, sticking equations (16.81) into the  $P_N$  boundary conditions, equations (16.21), gives us a consistent set of conditions for the  $SP_N$ - equations:

$$
\begin{array}{r}\sum_{k\mathrm{even}}^{N - 1}I_k\int_0^1 P_k(\mu)P_{2i - 1}(\mu)d\mu +\sum_{k\mathrm{odd}}^N\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \mathbf{I}_k\int_0^1 P_k(\mu)P_{2i - 1}(\mu)d\mu = \frac{J_w}{\pi}\int_0^1 P_{2i - 1}(\mu)d\mu ,\\ i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{1}{2} (N + 1), \end{array} \tag{16.84}
$$

or, with the definition of the Legendre polynomial half- moments  $p_{n_k}^m$  given by equation (16.71),

$$
\sum_{k\mathrm{even}}^{N - 1}p_{k,2i - 1}^0 I_k + \sum_{k\mathrm{odd}}^N p_{k,2i - 1}^0\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \mathbf{I}_k = \frac{p_{0,2i - 1}^0}{\pi} J_w,i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{1}{2} (N + 1). \tag{16.85}
$$

Again, eliminating the odd  $\mathbf{I}_k$  with equation (16.82b), this set of boundary conditions reduces to

$$
\begin{array}{r}\sum_{k\mathrm{even}}^{N - 1}p_{k,2i - 1}^0 I_k - \sum_{k\mathrm{odd}}^N\frac{p_{k,2i - 1}^0}{\alpha_k}\left[\frac{k}{2k - 1}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \nabla_\tau I_{k - 1} + \frac{k + 1}{2k + 3}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \nabla_\tau I_{k + 1}\right] = \frac{p_{0,2i - 1}^0}{\pi} J_w\\ i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{1}{2} (N + 1). \end{array} \tag{16.86}
$$

No direct formula for intensity is derived, but one may assume a series of the form

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_0(\mathbf{r}) + \mathbf{I}_1(\mathbf{r})\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} +I_2(\mathbf{r})P_2^0 (\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + \ldots , \tag{16.87}
$$

which is no longer a complete series of orthogonal functions and, therefore, is not guaranteed to approach the exact answer in the limit. However, assuming this to be an orthogonal set, we can obtain incident radiation  $G$  and radiative flux  $\mathbf{q}$  from their definitions as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{G(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{4\pi}I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega = 4\pi I_0(\mathbf{r}),}\\ {\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{4\pi}I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = \frac{4\pi}{3}\mathbf{I}_1(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{4\pi}{3\alpha_1}\left[\nabla_\tau I_0 + \frac{2}{5}\nabla_\tau I_2\right].} \end{array} \tag{16.89}
$$

While equations (16.83) and (16.86) form a self- consistent set of  $(N + 1) / 2$  simultaneous elliptic partial differential equations and their boundary conditions, the problem can be further simplified by recognizing that the combination of variables

$$
J_{k} = \frac{k + 1}{2k + 1} I_{k} + \frac{k + 2}{2k + 5} I_{k + 2} \tag{16.90}
$$

appears repeatedly in both the governing equations and boundary conditions. In addition, inspection of Table 16.2 shows that  $p_{n,j}^{0} = 0$  if  $n + j =$  even, with the exception of  $n = j$ . Thus we may rewrite equations (16.83) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{k = 0,2,\ldots ,N - 1\quad (\mathrm{even}):}\\ {\frac{k + 1}{2k + 3}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{\alpha_{k + 1}}\nabla_{\tau}J_{k}\right) + \frac{k}{2k - 1}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{\alpha_{k - 1}}\nabla_{\tau}J_{k - 2}\right) = \alpha_{k}(I_{k} - I_{b}\delta_{0k}),} \end{array} \tag{16.91}
$$

and boundary conditions (16.86) as

$$
\frac{p_{2i - 1,2i - 1}^{0}}{\alpha_{2i - 1}}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \nabla_{\tau}J_{i - 2} = \sum_{k = 0}^{\frac{N - 1}{2}}p_{2k,2i - 1}^{0}I_{2k} - \frac{p_{0,2i - 1}^{0}}{\pi} J_{w},\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{1}{2} (N + 1). \tag{16.92}
$$

The  $I_{k}$  on the right- hand sides may be eliminated by inverting equation (16.90), starting with  $k = N - 1$  (and noting that  $I_{N + 1}\equiv 0$ ). This results in individual partial differential equations for each  $J_{k}$ , in which  $J_{l}$ $(l\neq k)$  occur only as source terms without derivatives. Once the  $J_{k}$  have been determined, incident radiation and radiative flux are obtained from equations (16.88) and (16.89) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{G(\mathbf{r}) = 4\pi \left[J_0(\mathbf{r}) - \frac{2}{3} J_2(\mathbf{r}) + \frac{24}{55} J_4(\mathbf{r}) - + \ldots \right],}\\ {\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{r}) = -\frac{4\pi}{3\alpha_1}\nabla_\tau J_0(\mathbf{r}).} \end{array} \tag{16.94}
$$

We will demonstrate this by looking in more detail at the  $SP_{1}$  - and  $SP_{3}$  - approximations (even orders, such as  $SP_{2}$  , have also been formulated [58], but- based on the development shown here- - appear to be as inappropriate as for the standard  $P_N$  - method).

# $SP_{1}$  -Approximation

With  $N = 1$  we obtain a single equation and a single boundary condition from equations (16.91) and (16.92), i.e.:

Governing equation:

$$
k = 0:\frac{1}{3}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{\alpha_{1}}\nabla_{\tau}J_{0}\right) = \alpha_{0}(I_{0} - I_{b}); \tag{16.95}
$$

Boundary condition:

$$
i = 1:\frac{p_{1,1}^{0}}{\alpha_{1}}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \nabla_{\tau}J_{0} = p_{0,1}^{0}(I_{0} - J_{w} / \pi). \tag{16.96}
$$

With  $p_{0,1}^{0} = \frac{1}{2}$  and  $p_{1,1}^{0} = \frac{1}{3}$  from Table 16.2, and  $I_{0} = J_{0}$  from equation (16.90), we obtain

$$
\frac{1}{3}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{\alpha_{1}}\nabla_{\tau}J_{0}\right) = \alpha_{0}(J_{0} - I_{b}), \tag{16.97}
$$

with boundary condition

$$
\frac{1}{3\alpha_1}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \nabla_\tau J_0 = \frac{1}{2} (J_0 - J_w / \pi). \tag{16.98}
$$

Not surprisingly, comparison with equations (16.38) and (16.49) and using  $G = 4\pi I_{0} = 4\pi J_{0}$  shows that the  $SP_{1}$  - approximation is identical to the  $P_{1}$  - method.

# $SP_{3}$ -Approximation

Setting  $N = 3$  we get two simultaneous equations and two boundary conditions: Governing equations:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{k=0:}&{\frac{1}{3}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{\alpha_{1}}\nabla_{\tau}J_{0}\right)=\alpha_{0}(I_{0}-I_{b})=\alpha_{0}\left(J_{0}-\frac{2}{3}J_{2}-I_{b}\right),}\\{k=2:}&{\frac{3}{7}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{\alpha_{3}}\nabla_{\tau}J_{2}\right)+\frac{2}{3}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot\left(\frac{1}{\alpha_{1}}\nabla_{\tau}J_{0}\right)=\alpha_{2}I_{2}=\frac{5}{3}\alpha_{2}J_{2},}\end{array} \tag{16.99b}
$$

or, subtracting  $2 \times$  equation (16.99a),

$$
k = 2:\frac{3}{7}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \left(\frac{1}{\alpha_{3}}\nabla_{\tau}J_{2}\right) = \left(\frac{5}{3}\alpha_{2} + \frac{4}{3}\alpha_{0}\right)J_{2} - 2\alpha_{0}(J_{0} - I_{b}). \tag{16.99c}
$$

Boundary conditions:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{i=1:}&{\frac{p_{1,1}^{0}}{\alpha_{1}}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\nabla_{\tau}J_{0}=p_{0,1}^{0}(I_{0}-J_{w}/\pi)+p_{2,1}^{0}I_{2},}\\{i=2:}&{\frac{p_{3,3}^{0}}{\alpha_{3}}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\nabla_{\tau}J_{2}=p_{0,3}^{0}(I_{0}-J_{w}/\pi)+p_{2,3}^{0}I_{2}.}\end{array} \tag{16.100a}
$$

With  $p_{2,1}^{0} = p_{2,3}^{0} = \frac{1}{8}, p_{3,3}^{0} = \frac{1}{7}, p_{0,2}^{0} = - \frac{1}{8},$  and eliminating the  $I_{k}$ , the boundary conditions become

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{i=1:}&{\frac{1}{3\alpha_1}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\nabla_\tau J_0=\frac{1}{2}(J_0-\frac{2}{3}J_2-J_w/\pi)+\frac{1}{8}\frac{5}{3}J_2=\frac{1}{2}(J_0-J_w/\pi)-\frac{1}{8}J_2,}\\{i=2:}&{\frac{1}{7\alpha_3}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot\nabla_\tau J_2=-\frac{1}{8}(J_0-\frac{2}{3}J_2-J_w/\pi)+\frac{1}{8}\frac{5}{3}J_2=-\frac{1}{8}(J_0-J_w/\pi)+\frac{7}{24}J_2.}\end{array} \tag{16.100d}
$$

Unlike the regular  $P_{3}$ - approximation,  $SP_{3}$  has only two, and nearly separated, elliptic partial differential equations: equations (16.99a) and (16.100c) for  $J_{0}$  and equations (16.99c) and (16.100d) for  $J_{2}$ , the only connection being the other  $J_{k}$  appearing in source terms.

Example 16.8. Repeat Examples 16.4, 16.6, and 16.7 using the  $SP_{3}$ - approximation.

# Solution

For a nonscattering medium without  $z$ - dependence equations (16.99) reduce to

$$
\begin{array}{r}\frac{1}{3} (\mathcal{L}_{xx} + \mathcal{L}_{yy})J_0 - J_0 = -\frac{2}{3} J_2 - I_b,\\ \frac{1}{7} (\mathcal{L}_{xx} + \mathcal{L}_{yy})J_2 - J_2 = -\frac{2}{3} (J_0 - I_b), \end{array}
$$

where we have used the operators defined in equation (16.53) for better comparison with the equivalent  $P_{3}$  set of Example 16.4.

The boundary conditions for a general location simplify to

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{1}{3}\frac{\partial J_0}{\partial\tau_{\overline{z}}} = \frac{1}{2} (J_0 - I_b) - \frac{1}{8} J_2,\\ \displaystyle \frac{1}{7}\frac{\partial J_2}{\partial\tau_{\overline{z}}} = -\frac{1}{8} (J_0 - I_b) + \frac{7}{24} J_2. \end{array}
$$

Finally, for the one- dimensional case with only  $y$ - dependence, and again taking advantage of the symmetry by placing  $\tau_{y} = 0$  at the midplane, the equations and boundary conditions further reduce to

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{1}{3} J_0'' - J_0 = -\frac{2}{3} J_2 - I_b,\\ \displaystyle \frac{1}{7} J_2'' - J_2 = -\frac{2}{3} (J_0 - I_b), \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{ll}\tau_y = 0: & J_0' = J_2' = 0,\\ \displaystyle \tau_y = -\tau_L / 2: & \frac{1}{3} J_0' = \frac{1}{2} (J_0 - I_{bw}) - \frac{1}{8} J_2,\\ \displaystyle \frac{1}{7} J_2' = -\frac{1}{8} (J_0 - I_{bw}) + \frac{7}{24} J_2. \end{array}
$$

The set of two simultaneous equations is readily reduced to one, by solving the first for  $J_{2}$ :

$$
J_{2} = \frac{3}{2} (J_{0} - I_{b}) - \frac{1}{2} J_{0}^{\prime \prime},
$$

then substituting for  $J_{2}$  and  $J_{2}^{\prime \prime}$  in the second, or

or

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\frac{1}{7}\left[\frac{3}{2} J_0^{\prime \prime} - \frac{1}{2} J_0^{(iv)}\right] - \left[\frac{3}{2} (J_0 - I_b) - \frac{1}{2} J_0^{\prime \prime}\right] = -\frac{2}{3} (J_0 - I_b),}\\ {}\\ {\frac{3}{35} J_0^{(iv)} - \frac{6}{7} J_0^{\prime \prime} + J_0 = I_b.} \end{array}
$$

Similarly, we eliminate  $J_{2}$  from the boundary conditions:

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\tau_y = 0:}\\ {\tau_y = -\tau_L / 2:}\\ {\frac{1}{7}\left[\frac{3}{2} J_0' - \frac{1}{2} J_0'''\right] = -\frac{1}{8} (J_0 - I_{bw}) + \frac{7}{24}\left[\frac{3}{2} (J_0 - I_b) - \frac{1}{2} J_0'''\right],} \end{array}
$$

leading to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\tau_y = -\tau_L / 2:}\\ {I_{bw} - I_b = \frac{5}{8} (J_0 - I_b) - \frac{2}{3} J_0' + \frac{1}{8} J_0''}\\ {I_{bw} - I_b = -\frac{5}{2} (J_0 - I_b) + \frac{12}{7} J_0' + \frac{7}{6} J_0'' - \frac{4}{7} J_0'''}.} \end{array}
$$

Since the governing fourth- order equation is exactly the same as the one for  $I_{0}$  in Example 16.7, the solution is also the same,

$$
J_{0}(\tau_{y}) = I_{b} + (I_{bw} - I_{b})[C_{1}\cosh \lambda_{1}\tau_{y} + C_{2}\cosh \lambda_{2}\tau_{y}],
$$

(here given right away without the  $C_{3}$  and  $C_{4}$ , which are eliminated through the  $\tau_{y} = 0$  boundary condition). Again,

$$
C_1 = \frac{b_2 - a_2}{a_1b_2 - a_2b_1},\qquad C_2 = \frac{a_1 - b_1}{a_1b_2 - a_2b_1},
$$

but with the  $a_{i}$  and  $b_{i}$  replaced by

$$
\begin{array}{l}{a_i = \left(\frac{5}{8} +\frac{1}{8}\lambda_i^2\right)\cosh \lambda_i\frac{\tau_i}{2} +\frac{2}{3}\lambda_i\sinh \lambda_i\frac{\tau_i}{2},}\\ {b_i = \left(-\frac{5}{2} +\frac{7}{6}\lambda_i^2\right)\cosh \lambda_i\frac{\tau_i}{2} -\left(\frac{12}{7}\lambda_i - \frac{4}{7}\lambda_i^3\right)\sinh \lambda_i\frac{\tau_i}{2},} \end{array} \tag{i=1,2,}
$$

The heat flux through the medium is determined from equation (16.89) as

$$
q(\tau_y) = -\frac{4\pi}{3}\left(I_0' + \frac{2}{5} J_2'\right) = -\frac{4\pi}{3} J_0'.
$$

Substituting for  $J_{0}$  we may express the heat flux for a gray medium again in nondimensional form as

$$
\Psi = \frac{q(\tau_y)}{n^2\sigma(T_w^4 - T^4)} = -\frac{4}{3}\sum_{i = 1}^{2}C_i\lambda_i\sinh \lambda_i\tau_y.
$$

As mentioned in the beginning of this section, for a one- dimensional slab the  $SP_{N}$ - method reduces to the regular  $P_{N}$  solution. Therefore, the solution here must be identical to that of Example 16.4, which can be shown to be true after considerable algebra.

FIGURE 16-9 Radiative intensity within an arbitrary enclosure.

# 16.8 THE MODIFIED DIFFERENTIAL APPROXIMATION

As indicated earlier, the  $P_{1}$  - or differential approximation enjoys great popularity because of its relative simplicity and because of its compatibility with standard methods for the solution of the (overall) energy equation. The fact that the  $P_{1}$  - approximation may become very inaccurate in optically thin media- and thus of limited use- has prompted a number of investigators to seek enhancements or modifications to the differential approximation to make it reasonably accurate for all conditions [59- 70]. We shall briefly describe here the so- called modified differential approximation.

The directional intensity at any given point inside the medium is due to two sources: radiation originating from a surface (due to emission and reflection), and radiation originating from within the medium (due to emission and in- scattering). The contribution due to radiation emanating from walls may display very irregular directional behavior, especially in optically thin situations (due to surface radiosities varying across the enclosure surface, causing irradiation to change rapidly over incoming directions). Intensity emanating from inside the medium generally varies very slowly with direction because emission and isotropic scattering result in an isotropic radiation source. Only for highly anisotropic scattering may the radiation source- - and, therefore, at least locally also the intensity- display irregular directional behavior.

In what they termed the modified differential approximation (MDA) Olfe [59- 62] and Glatt and Olfe [71] separated wall emission from medium emission in simple black and gray- walled enclosures with gray, nonscattering media, evaluating radiation due to wall emission with exact methods, and radiation from medium emission with the differential (or  $P_{1}$  ) approximation. While very accurate, their model was limited to nonscattering media in simple, mostly one- dimensional enclosures. Wu and coworkers [63] demonstrated, for one- dimensional planeparallel media, that the MDA may be extended to scattering media with reflecting boundaries. Finally, Modest [64] showed that the method can be applied to three- dimensional linearanisotropically scattering media with reflecting boundaries. While until recently only used in conjunction with the  $P_{1}$  - approximation, higher order  $P_{N}$  - and  $SP_{N}$  - methods can also benefit from this approach, as recently shown by Modest and Yang [13], who demonstrated the accuracy of a modified  $P_{3}$  - approach.

Consider an arbitrary enclosure as shown in Fig. 16- 9. The equation of transfer is, from equation (16.4),

$$
\frac{dI}{dI_s} (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla_{\tau}I = S(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) - I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}), \tag{16.101}
$$

where, for linear- anisotropic scattering with a phase function given by equation (16.32), the radiative source term is, from equation (16.33),

$$
S(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = (1 - \omega)I_b(\mathbf{r}) + \frac{\omega}{4\pi} [G(\mathbf{r}) + A_1\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{r})\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} ]. \tag{16.102}
$$

For diffusely reflecting walls, equations (16.101) and (16.102) are subject to the boundary condition

$$
I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \frac{J_w}{\pi} (\mathbf{r}_w) = I_{bw}(\mathbf{r}_w) - \frac{1 - \epsilon}{\pi\epsilon}\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} (\mathbf{r}_w), \tag{16.103}
$$

where  $J_{w}$  is the surface radiosity related to  $I_{bw}$  and  $q_{w} = \mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}$  through equation (16.46).

We now break up the intensity at any point into two components: one,  $I_{w}$ , which may be traced back to emission from the enclosure wall (but may have been attenuated by absorption and scattering in the medium, and by reflections from the enclosure walls), and the remainder,  $I_{m}$ , which may be traced back to the radiative source term (i.e., radiative intensity released within the medium into a given direction by emission and scattering). Thus, we write

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_w(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + I_m(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) \tag{16.104}
$$

and let  $I_{w}$  satisfy the equation

$$
\frac{dI_w}{d\tau_s} (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = -I_w(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}), \tag{16.105}
$$

leading to

$$
I_{w}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \frac{J_{w}}{\pi} (\mathbf{r}_{w})e^{-\tau_{s}}, \tag{16.106}
$$

as indicated in Fig. 16- 9. Since for  $I_{w}$  no radiative source within the medium is considered, the radiosity in equation (16.106) is the one caused by wall emission only (with attenuation within the medium). The radiosity variation along the enclosure wall may be determined by invoking the definition of the radiosity as the sum of emission plus reflected irradiation, or

$$
\begin{array}{l}{J_w(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon \pi I_{bw}(\mathbf{r}) + (1 - \epsilon)\int_{\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} < 0}I_w(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})|\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} |d\Omega}\\ {= \epsilon \pi I_{bw}(\mathbf{r}) + (1 - \epsilon)\int_AJ_w(\mathbf{r}_w)\frac{\cos\theta\cos\theta'}{\pi S^2} e^{-\tau_s}dA,} \end{array} \tag{16.107}
$$

as also indicated in Fig. 16- 9. The surface integral representation of equation (16.107) is obtained by invoking the definition of solid angle, equation (1.29), or  $d\Omega = \cos \theta ' dA / S^2$ , equivalent to the definition of view factors in Chapter 4.

Equation (16.107) is the standard integral equation for the radiosity in an enclosure without a participating medium, except for the attenuation factor  $e^{- \tau_s}$ , and may be solved by standard methods such as breaking up the enclosure surface into  $N$  small subsurfaces of constant radiosity. Assuming that the attenuation term may be approximated by the value between node centers leads to

$$
J_{i} = \epsilon_{i}\pi I_{b i} + (1 - \epsilon_{i})\sum_{j = 1}^{N}J_{j}e^{-\tau_{i j}}F_{i - j},\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{16.108}
$$

where the  $F_{i - j}$  are the view factors between the subsurfaces.

It remains to calculate the contribution to the intensity from within the medium. Assuming that the  $P_1$ - approximation adequately represents intensity emanating from within the medium, we write, using equation (16.31),

$$
I_{m}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\simeq \frac{1}{4\pi} [G_{m}(\mathbf{r}) + 3\mathbf{q}_{m}(\mathbf{r})\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} ], \tag{16.109}
$$

where  $G_{m}$  and  $\mathbf{q}_m$  are medium- related incident radiation and heat flux, respectively, defined by

$$
\begin{array}{l}{G_m(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{4\pi}I_m(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega ,}\\ {\mathbf{q}_m(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{4\pi}I_m(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega .} \end{array} \tag{16.111}
$$

Substituting equations (16.105) and (16.109) into equation (16.101) we get

$$
\frac{dI_m}{d\tau_s} = \hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla_\tau I_m\simeq (1 - \omega)I_b + \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\left[G_w + G_m + A_1(\mathbf{q}_w + \mathbf{q}_m)\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}\right] - I_m, \tag{16.112}
$$

where the wall- related incident radiation and heat flux are defined as

$$
\begin{array}{r}G_{w}(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{4\pi}I_{w}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{4\pi}J_{w}(\mathbf{r}_{w})e^{-\tau_{s}}d\Omega ,\\ \mathbf{q}_{w}(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{4\pi}I_{w}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{4\pi}J_{w}(\mathbf{r}_{w})e^{-\tau_{s}}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega . \end{array} \tag{16.113}
$$

After integrating equation (16.112) over all solid angles, we have

$$
\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \mathbf{q}_{m} = (1 - \omega)4\pi I_{b} + \omega (G_{w} + G_{m}) - G_{m}. \tag{16.115}
$$

If equation (16.112) is multiplied by  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  before integration over all directions, we get

$$
\nabla_{\tau}G_{m} = A_{1}\omega (\mathbf{q}_{w} + \mathbf{q}_{m}) - 3\mathbf{q}_{m}. \tag{16.116}
$$

Equations (16.115) and (16.116) are a complete set of equations for the unknowns  $G_{m}$  and  $\mathbf{q}_m$ . [For higher- order  $P_N$ - approximations, additional equations would need to be generated by multiplying equation (16.112) by successively higher- order harmonics before integration.] The necessary boundary conditions for equations (16.115) and (16.116) are found by making an energy balance for medium- related radiation at a point on the surface

$$
I_{m}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \epsilon \int_{\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} < 0}I_{m}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} d\Omega , \tag{16.117}
$$

which, after substituting equation (16.109) for  $I_{m}$ , leads to Marshak's boundary condition for a cold surface,

$$
2\left(\frac{2}{\epsilon} -1\right)\mathbf{q}_m\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} +G_m = 0. \tag{16.118}
$$

[For a more detailed derivation of these relations see the similar development of the  $P_1$ - approximation, equations (16.34) through (16.37).] Equations (16.115) and (16.116), together with boundary condition (16.118), constitute a set of equations for the determination of the medium- related incident radiation and heat flux, with enclosure wall- related incident radiation and heat flux given by equations (16.113), (16.114), and (16.107). Finally, the total values for incident radiation and heat flux are given by

$$
\begin{array}{r}G = G_w + G_m,\\ \mathbf{q} = \mathbf{q}_w + \mathbf{q}_m. \end{array} \tag{16.120}
$$

This solution will reduce to the correct solution for the optically thin limit (where the medium- related contribution vanishes), and to the unmodified  $P_1$ - approximation for the optically thick limit. For nonscattering or isotropically scattering media, the method requires the solution to a Helmholtz equation (similar to the ordinary  $P_1$ - approximation), and the additional evaluation of

FIGURE 16-10 Intensities for a one-dimensional plane-parallel slab.

$$

a scalar surface integral for every point in the medium  $(G_{w})$ ; whereas, for anisotropic scattering,  $G_{w}$  as well as a vector surface integral  $(\mathbf{q}_w)$  must be evaluated. In addition, for the determination of radiosities, a surface integral equation must be solved (or view factors evaluated). If the extinction coefficient is independent of temperature, the  $G_{w}$  (and  $\mathbf{q}_w$ ) integrals do not depend on medium temperature and, thus, may be evaluated once and for all (i.e., they will not enter any iterative process if the temperature field of the medium is to be determined). If the extinction coefficient is temperature dependent, a solution for  $G_{w}$  and  $\mathbf{q}_w$ , based on gross estimates for the temperature field [in order to calculate the optical distances  $\tau_{i}$ , in equation (16.108)], still will result in the correct optically thin and thick limits and, therefore, can be expected to be of reasonable accuracy everywhere in between.

Example 16.9. Consider a one- dimensional, gray, absorbing/emitting and isotropically scattering slab with refractive index  $n = 1$  at radiative equilibrium, contained between two isothermal black walls at temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , respectively. Determine the radiative heat flux between the plates using the modified differential approximation.

# Solution

Measuring optical distance  $\tau = \int_0^z\beta dz$  perpendicular to the plates, as shown in Fig. 16- 10, one may readily determine the wall- related intensity as

$$
I_{w}(\tau ,\mu) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\frac{\sigma T_{1}^{4}}{\pi} e^{-\tau /\mu}, & 0< \mu \leq 1,\\ \displaystyle \frac{\sigma T_{2}^{4}}{\pi} e^{(\tau_{L} - \tau) / \mu}, & -1\leq \mu < 0, \end{array} \right.
$$

leading to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{G_w(\tau) = 2\pi \int_{-1}^{1}Iwd\mu = 2\sigma T_1^4 E_2(\tau) + 2\sigma T_2^4 E_2(\tau_L - \tau),}\\ {q_w(\tau) = 2\pi \int_{-1}^{1}Iwd\mu = 2\sigma T_1^4 E_3(\tau) - 2\sigma T_2^4 E_3(\tau_L - \tau).} \end{array}
$$

Substituting these expressions into equation (16.116) with  $A_{1} = 0$  and  $q_{m} = q - q_{w}$  gives

$$
\frac{dG_m}{d\tau} = -3q + 6\left[\sigma T_1^4 E_3(\tau) - \sigma T_2^4 E_3(\tau_L - \tau)\right].
$$

Since  $q =$  const, due to radiative equilibrium, this equation is readily integrated, and

$$
G_{m} = C - 3q\tau -6\left[\sigma T_{1}^{4}E_{4}(\tau) + \sigma T_{2}^{4}E_{4}(\tau_{L} - \tau)\right].
$$

The constants  $C$  and  $q$  may be found from the boundary conditions, equation (16.118), or

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\tau = 0:2q_m + G_m = 2q - 2\sigma T_1^4 +4\sigma T_2^4 E_3(\tau_L) + C - 2\sigma T_1^4 -6\sigma T_2^4 E_4(\tau_L) = 0,}\\ & {\tau = \tau_L: - 2q_m + G_m = -2q + 4\sigma T_1^4 E_3(\tau_L) - 2\sigma T_2^4 +C - 3q\tau_L - 6\sigma T_1^4 E_4(\tau_L) - 2\sigma T_2^4 = 0.} \end{array}
$$

Subtracting the second boundary condition from the first yields the nondimensional heat flux as

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = \frac{1 + E_3(\tau_L) - \frac{3}{2}E_4(\tau_L)}{1 + 3\tau_L / 4}.
$$

Comparison with exact values from Table 14.1 as well as those from the ordinary differential approximation (ODA), given in Example 15.5, shows that the ODA has a maximum error of  $\approx 3.3\%$ , compared with  $\approx 1.3\%$  for the MDA (both near  $\tau_{L} = 1$ ). This comparison, however, in no way demonstrates the power of the present method, since this problem is one of the very few in which the ordinary differential approximation actually reduces to the correct optically thin limit.

Example 16.10. Consider a one- dimensional, gray, absorbing/emitting, nonscattering slab between two isothermal black plates, both at temperature  $T_{w}$ . The medium has a refractive index of  $n = 1$  and is isothermal at  $T_{m}$ . Determine the radiative heat flux between the plates using the MDA.

# Solution

The wall- related heat flux follows immediately from the previous example as

$$
q_{w}(\tau) = 2\sigma T_{w}^{4}[E_{3}(\tau) - E_{3}(\tau_{L} - \tau)].
$$

For a nonscattering medium equations (16.115) and (16.116) contain no wall- related terms, and

$$
\frac{d^2G_m}{d\tau^2} = -3\frac{dq_m}{d\tau} = -3(4\sigma T_m^4 -G_m),
$$

or

$$
G_{m}(\tau) = C_{1}e^{-\sqrt{3}\tau} + C_{2}e^{+\sqrt{3}\tau} + 4\sigma T_{m}^{4} = C\left[e^{-\sqrt{3}\tau} + e^{-\sqrt{3} (\tau_{L} - \tau)}\right] + 4\sigma T_{m}^{4},
$$

where, in the last equation, we have used the fact that  $G_{m}(\tau) = G_{m}(\tau_{L} - \tau)$ , as a result of symmetry. The medium- related heat flux follows as

$$
q_{m} = -\frac{1}{3}\frac{dG_{m}}{d\tau} = \frac{C}{\sqrt{3}}\left[e^{-\sqrt{3}\tau} - e^{-\sqrt{3} (\tau_{L} - \tau)}\right].
$$

Applying the boundary condition at  $\tau = 0$ , we obtain

$$
2q_{m} + G_{m} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}} C\left(1 - e^{-\sqrt{3}\tau_{L}}\right) + C\left(1 + e^{-\sqrt{3}\tau_{L}}\right) + 4\sigma T_{m}^{4} = 0,
$$

and

$$
q_{m}(\tau) = -\frac{4\sigma T_{m}^{4}\left[e^{-\sqrt{3}\tau} - e^{-\sqrt{3}(\tau_{L} - \tau)}\right]}{2 + \sqrt{3} - (2 - \sqrt{3})e^{-\sqrt{3}\tau_{L}}}.
$$

The total heat flux is evaluated as  $q = q_{w} + q_{m}$ . At the lower surface we have

$$
q(0) = [1 - 2E_{3}(\tau_{L})]\sigma T_{w}^{4} - \frac{4\left(1 - e^{-\sqrt{3}\tau_{L}}\right)}{2 + \sqrt{3} - (2 - \sqrt{3})e^{-\sqrt{3}\tau_{L}}}\sigma T_{m}^{4}.
$$

This example illustrates a remaining weakness of the MDA: While  $q$  goes to the correct optically thin limit  $(q\rightarrow 0)$ , for the optically thick limit the term due to medium emission goes to the value predicted by the ODA, which is not equipped to handle temperature jumps within optically thick media. The result is not included in Fig. 16- 8 since it may lie anywhere between the exact and the  $P_{1}$  results, depending on the values of  $T_{w}$  and  $T_{m}$ .

Some multidimensional MDA examples have been given by [26, 28, 61, 64, 70- 74], proving their excellent accuracy under all conditions (even when the  $P_{1}$ - approximation fails).

# 16.9 COMPARISON OF METHODS

To better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the various spherical harmonics methods we will present a few example results for three two- dimensional problems, i.e., a square enclosure with a purely scattering medium, a square enclosure with prescribed temperature and absorption coefficient fields, and a (realistic) axisymmetric flame.

Purely Scattering Medium We consider a square enclosure filled with a purely scattering medium, with gray and spatially constant scattering coefficient  $\alpha_{s}$  (or, equivalently, a gray

![](images/46c51e9d8f7cf9ce0c9231f10c88a9264550ef70c4f77817bd1ee9878d176688.jpg)  
FIGURE 16-11 Comparison of various  $P_N$  and  $SP_N$  levels for surface heat fluxes in a purely scattering square enclosure; optically intermediate case  $\tau_L = 1.0$ .

medium at radiative equilibrium with constant extinction coefficient  $\beta$ . All four walls are black, and the bottom wall is at  $T_{\mathrm{w}} > 0$ , while the other three walls are at  $0\mathrm{K}$ . This type of problem has often been employed to show how so- called ray effects can adversely affect solutions obtained with the discrete ordinates method, which is the topic of the next chapter (see also Fig. 17- 7). Figure 16- 11 shows the normalized incoming irradiation  $H^{*} = H / \sigma T_{\mathrm{w}}^{4}$  (which must always be positive), for the top, side, and bottom walls for an optically intermediate case of  $\tau_{L} = \sigma_{s}L = 1$ , comparing results from  $P_{1}, P_{3}, SP_{3}, SP_{5}$ , and their modified versions to exact results obtained with the statistical Monte Carlo method (PMC, see Chapter 21). It is observed that none of the  $P_N$  and  $SP_N$  schemes give very satisfactory results, even leading to physically impossible negative irradiation at the bottom wall. The modified versions (the scheme being applied to all  $(S)P_N$  levels) give very good results for all cases, for this surface- driven problem; the modifying scheme provides much greater improvements than going to a higher- order method. Careful observation shows that higher- order  $SP_N$  retain the character of the  $P_{1}$  solution with only slight improvement. More detailed results are given in [13, 57], showing that the performance of the straight  $P_N$  and  $SP_N$  methods of all orders is very poor for optically thin situations, while modified  $P_{1}$  (and higher orders) give essentially exact answers.

Medium with Variable Gray Properties. Next we will consider a square enclosure with the following nondimensional field [18, 57, 75]:

with

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I_b = 1 + 5r^2 (2 - r^2),}\\ {\kappa = C_k\left[1 + \frac{15}{4} (2 - r^2)^2\right],} \end{array} \tag{16.121b}
$$

$$
r^2 = x^2 +y^2;\qquad -1\leq x\leq +1,\quad -1\leq y\leq +1, \tag{16.121c}
$$

i.e., the blackbody intensity (Planck function) is normalized with its minimum value (obtained at the center and the four corners), with a maximum value of  $I_{b} = 6$  at a distance of  $r = 1$  from the centerline. The absorption coefficient, normalized in terms of length units, has a maximum value of  $\kappa = 16C_{k}$  at  $x = y = 0$ , and rapidly diminishes away from the center to a minimum

![](images/f9285f158992b640f990bc43c37427a5eeb67bd740296607f41c21fd18611a81.jpg)  
FIGURE 16-12 Square enclosure with variable properties: (a) incident radiation and radiative source for optically thin case  $(C_{k} = 0.01)$ ; (b) radiative flux along bottom wall  $(y = -1)$ .

value of  $\kappa = C_{k}$  at the four corners. Thus the problem is radially one- dimensional, except for the conditions at the four perpendicular walls, which are assumed cold and black. The optical thickness of the square enclosure is  $\tau_{D} = 18\sqrt{2} C_{k}$  along a diagonal, and  $\tau_{L} = 23.5C_{k}$  along an  $x = 0$  or  $y = 0$  line, respectively. Here we present the solutions for incident radiation and divergence of radiative flux for the case of  $C_{k} = 0.01$  (optically thin conditions) in Fig. 16- 12a. Again, we compare several levels of the  $P_{N}$ - approximation, with corresponding results from the  $SP_{N}$ - methods, and against exact Monte Carlo results. Since there is no wall emission, there are no modified  $P_{N} / SP_{N}$  results. It is observed that none of the methods can predict the double maximum for incident radiation, but  $P_{3}$  considerably outperforms  $P_{1}$ , and  $P_{5}$  gives better answers than  $P_{3}$ . While  $SP_{3}$  and  $SP_{5}$  are improvements over the  $P_{1}$  results, their character remains similar to  $P_{1}$ . For intermediate and large optical thickness [57] all orders and methods rapidly become more accurate. All methods predict the divergence of the radiative flux well, with  $P_{1}$  lagging a bit in accuracy; this remains true for larger optical thickness. Figure 16- 12b shows radiative fluxes along the cold bottom wall for which, as expected,  $P_{1}$  gives the worst results for the optically thick case  $(C_{k} = 1)$ , because of the step in temperature at the wall. It is seen that  $P_{3}$  and  $P_{5}$  always give accurate results, while wall fluxes for  $P_{1}$  may display inaccuracies in multidimensional geometries.  $SP_{N}$  solutions display  $P_{1}$  character, i.e., lag in accuracy considerably behind their  $P_{N}$  counterpart.

Axisymmetric Nongray Flame As a final example we consider a realistic application in the form of an axisymmetric methane jet flame investigated in several studies [76, 77]. The flame is a scaled- up version of the much studied (but very small and, therefore, only weakly radiating) Sandia Flame D [78]. Figure 16- 13a shows temperature and concentration contours for the flame, with extreme temperature and concentration gradients in the radial (and, to a lesser extent, the axial) direction, which are accompanied by similar gradients in absorption coefficient and blackbody intensity. In addition, the absorption coefficient of absorption gases is strongly nongray, i.e., the flame is optically thin- to- transparent across parts of the spectrum, and optically thick in other parts, and the concentration of water vapor peaks at an earlier axial location than temperature and carbon dioxide (because of formation of CO before reaction to  $CO_{2}$  takes place). All this adds up to extreme challenges for the RTE solver (be it a spherical harmonics solver or one of the methods discussed in the following chapters) as well as the

![](images/b2d2bd74d74379e18fe4a1fda7dd6c15488b586c06c438cf53a6cf12a38db0b9.jpg)

spectral model. Figure 16- 13b shows the negative radiative source,  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}$  for one axial location (with off- axis maximum temperature) as calculated by the  $P_{1}$ ,  $SP_{3}$ , and  $SP_{5}$  methods together with the the Full Spectrum Correlated-  $k$  (FSCK) spectral model (to be discussed in Section 20.10), and compared to exact Monte Carlo calculations. We note in passing that the FSCK spectral model incurs very little error, so that differences between the  $(S)P_{N}$  solutions and Monte Carlo results are errors attributable to the  $(S)P_{N}$  methods, which—for this extremely challenging case—peak at  $35\%$ $(P_{1})$ ,  $25\%$ $(SP_{3})$ , and  $20\%$ $(SP_{5})$ , respectively.

# Problems

16.1 Consider a gray medium at radiative equilibrium contained within a long black cylinder with a surface temperature of  $T(r = R_z(z) = T_w(z)$ . Find the relevant boundary conditions for the  $P_{1}$ - approximation directly from equation (16.23), i.e., in a manner similar to the development in Example 16.1.

16.2 Consider a gray, isotropically scattering medium at radiative equilibrium contained between large, isothermal, gray plates at temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , and emittances  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$ , respectively. Determine the radiative heat flux between the plates using the  $P_{1}$ - approximation. Compare the result with the exact answer from Table 14.1.

16.3 Consider a large, isothermal (temperature  $T_{w}$ ), gray and diffuse (emittance  $\epsilon$ ) wall adjacent to a semi- infinite gray absorbing/emitting and linear- anisotropically scattering medium. The medium is isothermal (temperature  $T_{m}$ ). Determine the radiative heat flux as a function of distance away from the plate using the  $P_{1}$ - approximation with (i) Marshak's, (ii) Mark's boundary conditions.

16.4 Consider parallel, gray- diffuse plates, that are isothermal at temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , and with emittances  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$ , respectively. The plates are separated by a gray, linear- anisotropically scattering medium of thickness  $L$ , which is at radiative equilibrium. Using the  $P_{1}$ - approximation, determine the temperature distribution within, and the heat flux through, the medium. Compare the heat flux with the exact answer given by Table 14.1 (for isotropic scattering, and optical thicknesses of  $\tau_{i} = \beta L = 0$ , 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5). Show that the radiative heat flux can be obtained from the expression given in Example 16.3, by letting  $R_{2} = R_{1} + L \rightarrow \infty$ .

16.5 Black spherical particles of  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  radius are suspended between two cold and black parallel plates  $1\mathrm{m}$  apart. The particles produce heat at a rate of  $\pi /10\mathrm{W}/$  particle, which must be removed by thermal radiation. The number of particles between the plates is given by

$$
N_{T}(z) = N_{0} + \Delta Nz / L,\quad 0< z< L;\qquad N_{0} = \Delta N = 212\mathrm{~particles / cm^{3}}.
$$

(a) Determine the local absorption coefficient and the local heat production rate; introduce an optical coordinate and determine the optical thickness of the entire gap.  
(b) Assuming the  $P_{1}$ -approximation to be valid, what are the relevant equations and boundary conditions governing the heat transfer?  
(c) What are the heat flux rates at the top and bottom surfaces? What is the entire amount of energy released by the particles? What is the maximum particle temperature?

16.6 Consider parallel, black plates spaced  $1\mathrm{m}$  apart, at constant temperatures  $T_{1} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  and  $T_{2} = 300\mathrm{K}$ , respectively, separated by a gray, nonscattering medium at radiative equilibrium. The absorption coefficient of the medium depends on its temperature according to a power law,  $\kappa = \kappa_{0}(T / T_{0})^{n}$  ( $\kappa_{0} = 1\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$ ,  $T_{0} = 300\mathrm{K}$ , and  $n$  is an arbitrary, positive constant).

(a) Using the  $P_{1}$ -approximation, outline how to determine the radiative heat flux through, and temperature field within, the medium (i.e., the result may contain unsolved implicit relationships).  
(b) Write a small computer program to quantify the results for  $n = 0$ , 0.5, 1, and 4. Compare with results obtained for a constant  $\kappa$  [evaluated at an average temperature  $T_{\mathrm{av}} = 0.5 \times (300 + 1000) = 650\mathrm{K}$ ].

16.7 A gas/soot/coal mixture, which may be approximated as a gray, nonscattering medium with  $\kappa = 1.317\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$ , is burning inside a spherical container of diameter  $D = 1\mathrm{m}$ , which has black and cold walls. During combustion the coal particles release heat uniformly at a rate of  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} = 2.885\mathrm{MW} / \mathrm{m}^3$  (per total volume of container). The mixture remains at radiative equilibrium throughout the combustion process. Set up the necessary equations and boundary conditions to find the medium's temperature distribution and total heat loss rate, assuming the  $P_{1}$ - approximation to hold.

16.8 Given the soot distribution of Problem 12.16, it is found that soot is generated where combustion takes place, i.e., the local heat release due to combustion may be written as  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}(z) = \dot{Q}_{0}^{\prime \prime \prime}[1 - (z / L)^{2}]$ ,  $\dot{Q}_{0}^{\prime \prime \prime} = 10^{5}\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ . Assuming the soot to be nonscattering and gray (with properties evaluated at  $\lambda = 3\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) and conduction/convection to be negligible, and the walls to be cold and black, determine the temperature distribution within the medium using the  $P_{1}$ /differential approximation.

16.9 Two infinitely long concentric cylinders of radii  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$  with emittances  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$  both have the same constant surface temperature  $T_{w}$ . The medium between the cylinders has a constant absorption coefficient  $\kappa$  and does not scatter; uniform heat generation  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}$  takes place inside the medium. Determine the temperature distribution in the medium and heat fluxes at the wall if radiation is the only means of heat transfer by using the  $P_{1}$ - approximation.

16.10 An infinite, black, isothermal plate bounds a semi- infinite space filled with black spheres. At any given distance,  $z$ , away from the plate the particle number density is identical, namely  $N_{T} = 6.3662\times 10^{8}\mathrm{m}^{- 3}$ . However, the radius of the suspended spheres diminishes monotonically away from the surface as

$$
a = a_{o}e^{-z / L};\qquad a_{o} = 10^{-4}\mathrm{m},\qquad L = 1\mathrm{m}.
$$

(a) Determine the absorption coefficient as a function of  $z$  (you may make the large-particle assumption). 
(b) Determine the optical coordinate as a function of  $z$ . What is the total optical thickness of the semi-infinite space? 
(c) Assuming that radiative equilibrium prevails and that the differential approximation is valid, set up the boundary conditions. 
(d) Solve for heat flux and temperature distribution (as a function of  $z$ ).

16.11 Consider two parallel black plates both at  $1000\mathrm{K}$ , which are  $2\mathrm{m}$  apart. The medium between the plates emits and absorbs (but does not scatter) with an absorption coefficient of  $\kappa = 0.05236\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  (gray medium). Heat is generated by the medium according to the formula

$$
\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} = C\sigma T^{4},\qquad C = 6.958\times 10^{-4}\mathrm{cm}^{-1},
$$

where  $T$  is the local temperature of the medium between the plates. Assuming that radiation is the only important mode of heat transfer, determine the heat flux to the plates.

16.12 A furnace burning pulverized coal may be approximated by a gray cylinder at radiative equilibrium with uniform heat generation  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} = 0.266\mathrm{W / cm}^{3}$ , bounded by a cold black wall. The gray and constant absorption and scattering coefficients are, respectively,  $0.16\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  and  $0.04\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , while the furnace radius is  $R = 0.5\mathrm{m}$ . Scattering may be assumed to be isotropic. Using the  $P_{1}$ - approximation:

(a) Set up the relevant equations and their boundary conditions. 
(b) Calculate the total heat loss from the furnace (per unit length). 
(c) Calculate the radial temperature distribution; what are the centerline and adjacent-to-wall temperatures, respectively? 
(d) Qualitatively, keeping the extinction coefficient constant, what is the effect of varying the scattering coefficient on 
(i) heat transfer rates, 
(ii) temperature levels?

16.13 The coal particles of Problem 12.3 are burnt in a long cylindrical combustion chamber of  $R = 1\mathrm{m}$  radius. The combustor walls are gray and diffuse, with  $\epsilon_{w} = 0.8$ , and are at  $800\mathrm{K}$ . Since it is well stirred, combustion results in uniform heat generation throughout of  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} = 720\mathrm{kW} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$ . Determine the maximum temperature in the combustor, using the  $P_{1}$ /differential approximation, assuming radiation is the only mode of heat transfer (use  $\kappa = 4.5\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$  and  $\sigma_{s} = 0.5\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$  if the results of Problem 12.3 are not available).

16.14 Estimate the radial temperature distribution in the sun. You may make the following assumptions:

(i) The sun is a sphere of radius  $R$  (ii) As a result of high temperatures in the sun the absorption and scattering coefficients may be approximated to be constant, i.e.,  $\kappa_{\nu},\beta_{\nu} = \mathrm{const}\neq f(\nu ,T,r)$  (free-free transitions!). (iii) Due to high temperatures, radiation is the only mode of heat transfer.  $(iv)$  The fusion process may be approximated by assuming that a small sphere at the center of the sun releases heat uniformly corresponding to the total heat loss of the sun (i.e., assume the sun to be concentric spheres with a certain heat flux at the inner boundary  $r = r_i$  -  $(a)$  Relate the heat production to the effective sun temperature  $T_{\mathrm{SHMEff}} = 5777\mathrm{K}$ $(b)$  Would you expect the sun to be optically thin, intermediate, or thick? Why? What are the prevailing boundary conditions?  $(c)$  Find an expression for the temperature distribution (for  $r > r_i$ $(d)$  What is the surface temperature of the sun?

16.15 Repeat Problem 16.14 but replace assumption  $(iv)$  by the following: The fusion process may be approximated by assuming that the sun releases heat uniformly throughout its volume corresponding to the total heat loss of the sun.

16.16 Consider a sphere of very hot dissociated gas of radius  $5\mathrm{cm}$  . The gas may be approximated as a gray, linear- anisotropically scattering medium with  $\kappa = 0.1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ $\sigma_{s} = 0.2\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ $A_{1} = 1$  . The gas is suspended magnetically in vacuum within a large cold container and is initially at a uniform temperature  $T_{g} = 10,000\mathrm{K}$  . Using the  $P_{1}$  - approximation and neglecting conduction and convection, specify the total heat loss per unit time from the entire sphere at time  $t = 0$  .Outline the solution procedure for times  $t > 0$

Hint: Solve the governing equation by introducing a new dependent variable  $g(\tau) = \tau (4\pi I_b - G)$

16.17 A spherical test bomb of  $1\mathrm{m}$  radius is coated with a nonreflective material and cooled. Inside the sphere is nitrogen mixed with spherical particles at a rate of  $10^{8}$  particles  $/\mathrm{m}^{3}$  . The particles have a radius of  $300\mu \mathrm{m},$  and diffuse- gray with  $\epsilon = 0.5,$  and generate heat at a rate of  $150\mathrm{W / cm^3}$  of particle volume. Using absorption and scattering coefficients found in Problem 12.12, determine the temperature distribution inside the bomb, using the  $P_{1}$  - approximation and two simplified phase functions:

(i isotropic scattering, and (ii) linear- anisotropic back scattering with  $A_{1} = - 1$

In particular, what is the gas temperature at the center and at the wall? How much do the two scattering treatments differ from one another?

16.18 A revolutionary new fuel is ground up into small particles, magnetically confined to remain within a spherical cloud of radius  $R$  .This cloud of particles has a constant, gray absorption coefficient, does not scatter, and releases heat uniformly at  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}(\mathrm{W / m}^{3})$  . The cloud is suspended in a vacuum chamber, enclosed by a large, isothermal chamber (at  $T_{w}$  ). Heat transfer is solely by radiation, i.e.,  $\mathbf{V}\cdot \mathbf{q} = \left(1 / r^{2}\right)a\left(r^{2}q\right) / dr = \dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}$

(a) Assuming the  $P_{1}$  -approximation to be valid, set up the necessary equations and boundary conditions to determine the heat transfer rates, and temperature distribution within the spherical cloud. 
(b) Determine the maximum temperature in the cloud.

16.19 Repeat Problem 16.5 using subroutine P1sor and/or program P1- 2D. How do the answers change for a quadratic enclosure (side walls also cold and black)?

16.20 Repeat Problem 16.6 using subroutine P1sor and/or program P1- 2D. How do the answers change for a quadratic enclosure (side walls also black, with a linear surface temperature variation from  $T(x = 0) = T_{1}$  to  $T(x = L) = T_{2}$  )?

16.21 Consider a gray, isotropically scattering medium at radiative equilibrium contained between large, isothermal, gray plates at temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , and emittances  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$ , respectively. Determine the radiative heat flux between the plates using the  $P_{3}$ - approximation. Compare the results with the answer from Problem 16.2.

16.22 Do Problem 16.3 using the  $P_{3}$ - approximation with Marshak's boundary condition.

16.23 A hot gray medium is contained between two concentric black spheres of radius  $R_{1} = 10\mathrm{cm}$  and  $R_{2} = 20\mathrm{cm}$ . The surfaces of the spheres are isothermal at  $T_{1} = 2000\mathrm{K}$  and  $T_{2} = 500\mathrm{K}$ , respectively. The medium absorbs and emits with  $n = 1$ ,  $\kappa = 0.05\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , but does not scatter radiation. Determine the heat flux between the spheres using the modified differential approximation (MDA). Note: This problem requires the numerical solution of a simple ordinary differential equation.

16.24 Repeat Problem 16.23 for concentric cylinders of the same radii. Compare your result with those of Fig. 16- 5. Note: This problem requires the numerical solution of a simple ordinary differential equation.

# CHAPTER 17

# THE METHOD OF DISCRETE ORDINATES (S_N-APPROXIMATION)

# 17.1 INTRODUCTION

Like the spherical harmonics method, the discrete ordinate method is a tool to transform the equation of transfer (for a gray medium, or on a spectral basis) into a set of simultaneous partial differential equations. Like the  $P_N$ - method, the discrete ordinates or  $S_N$ - method may be carried out to any arbitrary order and accuracy, although the mathematical formulation of high- order  $S_N$ - schemes is considerably less involved. First proposed by Chandrasekhar [1] in his work on stellar and atmospheric radiation, the  $S_N$ - method originally received little attention in the heat transfer community. Again like the  $P_N$ - method, the discrete ordinates method was first systematically applied to problems in neutron transport theory, notably by Lee [2] and Lathrop [3, 4]. There were some early, unoptimized attempts to apply the method to one- dimensional, planar thermal radiation problems (Love et al. [5, 6], Hottel et al. [7], Roux and Smith [8, 9]). But only during the past thirty years has the discrete ordinates method been applied to, and optimized for, general radiative heat transfer problems, primarily through the pioneering works of Fiveland [10- 13] and Truelove [14- 16].

The discrete ordinates method is based on a discrete representation of the directional variation of the radiative intensity. A solution to the transport problem is found by solving the equation of transfer for a set of discrete directions spanning the total solid angle range of  $4\pi$ . As such, the discrete ordinates method is simply a finite differencing of the directional dependence of the equation of transfer. Integrals over solid angle are approximated by numerical quadrature (e.g., for the evaluation of the radiative source term, the radiative heat flux, etc.).

Today, many numerical heat transfer models use finite volumes rather than finite differences. Similarly, one may also use finite "solid angle volumes" for directional discretization. This variation of the discrete ordinates method is commonly known as the finite volume method (for radiative transfer), and enjoys increasing popularity. As a result of the relatively straightforward formulation of high- order implementations, the discrete ordinates method (DOM) and its finite volume cousin (FVM) have received great attention and are today probably the most popular RTE solvers (together with the  $P_1$ - approximation), and some version of them is incorporated in most commercial CFD codes. Detailed reviews of the capabilities and shortcomings of the

DOM and FVM have been given by Charest et al. [17] and by Coelho [18]. The latter provides the most complete description of the method for general geometries, far exceeding the details we can provide in this book.

In this chapter we shall first develop the set of partial differential equations for the standard  $S_{N}$ - method and their boundary conditions. This is followed by a section describing how the method may be applied to one- dimensional plane- parallel media, and another dealing with spherical and cylindrical geometries, and then its application to two- and three- dimensional problems will be outlined. This is followed by the development of the finite volume method and, finally, the chapter will close with a brief look at other, related methods.

# 17.2 GENERAL RELATIONS

The general equation of transfer for an absorbing, emitting, and anisotropically scattering medium is, according to equation (10.21),

$$
\frac{dI}{ds} = \hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \kappa (\mathbf{r})I_b(\mathbf{r}) - \beta (\mathbf{r})I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + \frac{\sigma_s(\mathbf{r})}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}')\Phi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}',\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega '. \tag{17.1}
$$

Equation (17.1) is valid for a gray medium or, on a spectral basis, for a nongray medium, and is subject to the boundary condition

$$
I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \epsilon (\mathbf{r}_w)I_b(\mathbf{r}_w) + \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}_w)}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '\prec 0}I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '|d\Omega ', \tag{17.2}
$$

where we have limited ourselves to an enclosure with opaque, diffusely emitting and diffusely reflecting walls. The extension of equation (17.2) to more complicated boundary conditions is straightforward.

# Discrete Ordinates Equations

In the discrete ordinates method, equation (17.1) is solved for a set of  $n$  different directions  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$ ,  $i = 1,2,\ldots ,n$ , and the integrals over direction are replaced by numerical quadratures, that is,

$$
\int_{4\pi}f(\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega \simeq \sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_{i}f(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i}), \tag{17.3}
$$

where the  $w_{i}$  are the quadrature weights associated with the directions  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$ . Thus, equation (17.1) is approximated by a set of  $n$  equations,

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i\cdot \nabla I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = \kappa (\mathbf{r})I_b(\mathbf{r}) - \beta (\mathbf{r})I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) + \frac{\sigma_s(\mathbf{r})}{4\pi}\sum_{j = 1}^{n}w_jI(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_j)\Phi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_j,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i),\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,n, \tag{17.4}
$$

subject to the boundary conditions

$$
I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = \epsilon (\mathbf{r}_w)I_b(\mathbf{r}_w) + \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}_w)}{\pi}\sum_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_j< 0}w_jI(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_j)|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_j|,\quad \hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i > 0. \tag{17.5}
$$

Each beam traveling in a direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  intersects the enclosure surface twice: once where the beam emanates from the wall  $(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i > 0)$ , and once where it strikes the wall, to be absorbed or reflected  $(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i< 0)$ . The governing equation is first order, requiring only one boundary condition (for the emanating intensity,  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i > 0$ ). Equations (17.4) together with their boundary conditions (17.5) constitute a set of  $n$  simultaneous, first- order, linear partial differential equations for the

unknown  $I_{i}(\mathbf{r}) = I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i})$ . The solution for the  $I_{i}$  may be found using any standard technique (analytical or numerical). If scattering is present  $(\sigma_{s}\neq 0)$ , and/or if the bounding walls are reflecting, the equations are coupled in such a way that generally an iterative procedure is necessary. Even in the absence of scattering and surface reflections, the temperature field may not be known, but must be calculated from the intensity field if radiative equilibrium persists, again making iterations necessary. Only in the absence of scattering and wall reflections, and if the temperature field is given, then the solution to the intensities  $I_{i}$  is straightforward (as is the exact solution).

Once the intensities have been determined the desired direction- integrated quantities are readily calculated. The radiative heat flux, inside the medium or at a surface, may be found from its definition, equation (10.52),

$$
\mathbf{q}(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{4\pi}I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega \simeq \sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_{i}I_{i}(\mathbf{r})\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i}. \tag{17.6}
$$

The incident radiation  $G$  [and, through equation (10.59), the divergence of the radiative heat flux] is similarly determined as

$$
G(\mathbf{r}) = \int_{4\pi}I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega \simeq \sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_{i}I_{i}(\mathbf{r}). \tag{17.7}
$$

At a surface the heat flux may also be determined from surface energy balances [equations (4.1) and (3.16)] as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} (w_w) = \epsilon (w_w)[\pi I_b(\mathbf{r}_w) - H(w_w)]\\ \displaystyle \simeq \epsilon (w_w)\big(\pi I_b(\mathbf{r}_w) - \sum_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i< 0}w_iI_i(\mathbf{r}_w)|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i\big)\big). \end{array} \tag{17.8}
$$

Equations (17.4) and (17.5) can be written in a somewhat more compact form if one limits the analysis to linear- anisotropic scattering, i.e., to a scattering phase function of

$$
\Phi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}},\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}) = 1 + A_{1}(\mathbf{r})\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}. \tag{17.9}
$$

Then, using equations (17.6) and (17.7) and/or equation (14.15) leads to

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i\cdot \nabla I_i + \beta I_i = \kappa I_b + \frac{\sigma_s}{4\pi} (G + A_1\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i),\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,n, \tag{17.10}
$$

with boundary condition

$$
I_{i} = \frac{J_{w}}{\pi} = I_{bw} - \frac{1 - \epsilon}{\epsilon\pi}\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}},\quad \hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i} > 0 \tag{17.11}
$$

at the enclosure surface. Of course, radiative heat flux and incident radiation are unknowns to be determined from directional intensities from the series in equations (17.6) and (17.7). Equations (17.10) and (17.11) are convenient forms for the iterative solution procedure: For each iteration values of  $G$  and  $\mathbf{q}$  are estimated, and the  $n$  intensities  $I_{i}$  are evaluated. The values for  $G$  and  $\mathbf{q}$  are then updated, and so on.

# Selection of Discrete Ordinate Directions

The choice of quadrature scheme is arbitrary, although restrictions on the directions  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i}$  and quadrature weights  $w_{i}$  may arise from the desire to preserve symmetry and to satisfy certain

conditions. It is customary to choose sets of directions and weights that are completely symmetric (i.e., sets that are invariant after any rotation of  $90^{\circ}$ ), and that satisfy the zeroth, first, and second moments, or

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\int_{4\pi}d\Omega = 4\pi = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_{i},}\\ {\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = \textbf{0} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_{i}\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i},}\\ {\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = \frac{4\pi}{3}\delta = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}w_{i}\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i}\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i},} \end{array} \tag{17.12b}
$$

where  $\delta$  is the unit tensor [cf. equation (16.30)]. Different sets of directions and weights satisfying all these criteria have been tabulated, for example, by Lee [2] and Lathrop and Carlson [19]. Fiveland [12] and Truelove [15] have observed that different sets of ordinates may result in considerably different accuracy. They noted that  $(i)$  the intensity may have directional discontinuity at a wall, and  $(ii)$  the important radiative heat fluxes at the walls are evaluated through a first moment of intensity over a half range of  $2\pi$  [equation (17.8)]. They concluded that the set of ordinates and weights should also satisfy the first moment over a half range, that is,

$$

$$

While it is impossible to satisfy equation (17.13) for arbitrary orientations of the surface normal, it can be satisfied for the principal orientations, if  $\hat{\mathbf{n}} = \hat{\mathbf{i}},\hat{\mathbf{j}},$  or  ${\bf k}$  . Sets of ordinates and weights that satisfy  $(i)$  the symmetry requirement,  $(ii)$  the moment equations (17.12), and  $(iii)$  the halfmoment equation (17.13) (for the three principal directions of  $\hat{\mathbf{n}})^1$  have been given by Lathrop and Carlson [19]. The first four sets labeled  $S_{2^{- }}$ $S_{4^{- }}$ $S_{6^{- }}$  and  $S_{8}$  - approximation are reproduced in Table 17.1. In the table the  $\xi_{i},\eta_{i},$  and  $\mu_{i}$  are the direction cosines of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,$  or

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i = (\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{i}})\hat{\mathbf{i}} +(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{j}})\hat{\mathbf{j}} +(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{k}})\hat{\mathbf{k}} = \xi_i\hat{\mathbf{i}} +\eta_i\hat{\mathbf{j}} +\mu_i\hat{\mathbf{k}}. \tag{17.14}
$$

Only positive direction cosines are given in Table 17.1, covering one eighth of the total range of solid angles  $4\pi$ . To cover the entire  $4\pi$  any or all of the values of  $\xi_{i}, \eta_{i},$  and  $\mu_{i}$  may be positive or negative. Therefore, each row of ordinates contains eight different directions. For example, for the  $S_{2}$ - approximation the different directions are  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{1} = 0.577350(\hat{\mathbf{i}} + \hat{\mathbf{j}} + \hat{\mathbf{k}})$ ,  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{2} = 0.577350(\hat{\mathbf{i}} + \hat{\mathbf{j}} - \hat{\mathbf{k}})$ , ...,  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{8} = - 0.577350(\hat{\mathbf{i}} + \hat{\mathbf{j}} + \hat{\mathbf{k}})$ . Since the symmetric  $S_{2}$ - approximation does not satisfy the half- moment condition, a nonsymmetric  $S_{2}$ - approximation is also included in Table 17.1, as proposed by Truelove [15]. This approximation satisfies equation (17.13) for two principal directions and should be applied to one- and two- dimensional problems, from which the nonsymmetric term drops out (as seen in Example 17.1 in the following section). The name " $S_{N}$ - approximation" indicates that  $N$  different direction cosines are used for each principal direction. For example, for the  $S_{4}$ - approximation  $\xi_{i} = \pm 0.295876$  and  $\pm 0.908248$  (or  $\eta_{i}$  or  $\mu_{i}$ ). Altogether there are always  $n = N(N + 2)$  different directions to be considered (because of symmetry, many of these may be unnecessary for one- and two- dimensional problems). Several other quadrature schemes can be found in the literature. Carlson [20] proposed a set with equal weights  $w_{i}$  (such as the  $S_{2}$  and  $S_{4}$  sets in Table 17.1). Two more quadratures and a good review of the applicability of all discrete ordinate sets have been given by Fiveland [21]. Other publications documenting procedures for the generation of quadrature sets are those of Sánchez and Smith [22] and El- Wakil and Sacadura [23]. A new family of quadrature sets, like the  $S_{n}$

sets symmetric in  $90^{\circ}$  rotations, but with different arrangement of directions, have been given by Thurgood and coworkers [24], and have been dubbed  $T_{n}$  sets by the authors. These always generate positive weights and are claimed to reduce the so- called "ray effect" (which will be discussed a little later on p. 560). These sets have been further refined by Li and coworkers [25]. A comprehensive review of directional quadrature schemes, including an evaluation of their accuracies, has recently been given by Koch and Becker [26]. None of the above ordinate sets can treat collimated (i.e., unidirectional) irradiation accurately. To address this problem Li and coworkers [27] developed the ISW scheme adding a single ordinate of "infinitely small weight" to the regular quadrature set.

# 17.3 THE ONE-DIMENSIONAL SLAB

We will first demonstrate how the  $S_{N}$  discrete ordinates method is applied to the simple case of a one- dimensional plane- parallel slab bounded by two diffusely emitting and reflecting isothermal plates. As in previous chapters we shall limit ourselves to linear- anisotropic scattering, although extension to arbitrarily anisotropic scattering is straightforward. We avoid it here to make the steps in the development a little easier to follow. If we choose  $z$  as the spatial coordinate between the two plates  $(0 \leq z \leq L)$ , and introduce the optical coordinate  $\tau$  with  $d\tau = \beta dz (0 \leq \tau \leq \tau_{i})$ , equation (17.4) is transformed to

$$
\mu_{i}\frac{dI_{i}}{d\tau} = (1 - \omega)I_{b} - I_{i} + \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\sum_{j = 1}^{n}w_{j}I_{j}\left[1 + A_{1}(\mu_{i}\mu_{j} + \xi_{i}\xi_{j} + \eta_{i}\eta_{j})\right],\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,n. \tag{17.15}
$$

For a one- dimensional slab intensity is independent of azimuthal angle. Since for every ordinate  $j$  (with a given  $\mu_{j}$ ) with a positive value for  $\xi_{j}$  there is another with the same, but negative, value, and since the intensity is the same for both ordinates, the terms involving  $\xi_{j}$  in equation (17.15) add to zero. The same is true for the terms involving  $\eta_{j}$ , but not for those with  $\mu_{j}$  (since the intensity does depend on polar angle  $\theta$ , and  $\mu = \cos \theta$ ). However, the terms involving  $\mu_{j}$  are repeated several times: Each value of  $\mu$  (counting positive and negative  $\mu$ - values separately) shown in one row of Table 17.1 corresponds to four different ordinates (combinations of positive and negative values for  $\xi$  and  $\eta$ ). In addition, a particular value of  $\mu$  may occur on more than one line of Table 17.1. If all the quadrature weights corresponding to a single  $\mu$ - value are added together, equation (17.15) reduces to

$$
\mu_{i}\frac{dI_{i}}{d\tau} = (1 - \omega)I_{b} - I_{i} + \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\sum_{j = 1}^{N}w_{j}^{\prime}I_{j}(1 + A_{1}\mu_{i}\mu_{j}),\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{17.16}
$$

where the  $w_{j}^{\prime}$  are the summed quadrature weights. For example, for  $\mu = 0.2958759$  in the  $S_{4}$ - approximation the summed quadrature weight is  $w^{\prime} = 4\times (0.5235987 + 0.5235987) = 4\pi /3$ , and so forth. The ordinates and quadrature weights for the one- dimensional slab are listed in Table 17.2. Equation (17.16) could have been found less painfully by using equation (17.10) instead of (17.4), leading directly to

$$
\mu_{i}\frac{dI_{i}}{d\tau} +I_{i} = (1 - \omega)I_{b} + \frac{\omega}{4\pi} (G + A_{1}q\mu_{i}),\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{17.17}
$$

Before proceeding to the boundary conditions of equation (17.17) we should recognize that, of the  $N$  different intensities, half emanate from the wall at  $\tau = 0$  (with  $\mu_{i} > 0$ ), and the other half from the wall at  $\tau = \tau_{L}$  (with  $\mu_{i}< 0$ ). Following the notation of Chapter 14, we replace the  $N$  different  $I_{i}$  by

$$
I_1^+,I_2^+,...,I_{N / 2}^+\mathrm{and}I_1^-,I_2^-,...,I_{N / 2}^-
$$

Then equation (17.17) may be rewritten as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\mu_i\frac{dI_i^+}{d\tau} +I_i^+ = (1 - \omega)I_b + \frac{\omega}{4\pi} (G + A_1q\mu_i),}\\ {-\mu_i\frac{dI_i^-}{d\tau} +I^- = (1 - \omega)I_b + \frac{\omega}{4\pi} (G - A_1q\mu_i),}\\ {i = 1,2,\ldots ,N / 2;\quad \mu_i > 0.} \end{array} \tag{17.18b}
$$

With this notation the boundary conditions for equation (17.18) follow from equations (17.5) or (17.11) as

$$
\begin{array}{ll}\tau = 0: & I_i^+ = J_1 / \pi = I_{b1} - \frac{1 - \epsilon_1}{\epsilon_1\pi} q_1,\\ \displaystyle \tau = \tau_i: & I_i^- = J_2 / \pi = I_{b2} + \frac{1 - \epsilon_2}{\epsilon_2\pi} q_2,\\ \displaystyle & i = 1,2,\ldots ,N / 2,\quad \mu_i > 0. \end{array} \tag{17.19a}
$$

(For the boundary condition at  $\tau_{L}$  the sign switches since  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$  points in the direction opposite to  $z$ .) Radiative heat flux  $q$  and incident radiation  $G$  are related to the directional intensities through equations (17.6) and (17.7), or

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q = \sum_{i = 1}^{N / 2}w_i^{\prime}\mu_i(I_i^+ -I_i^-),}\\ {G = \sum_{i = 1}^{N / 2}w_i^{\prime}(I_i^+ +I_i^-).} \end{array} \tag{17.20b}
$$

At the two surfaces the radiative heat flux is more conveniently evaluated from equation (17.8) as

$$
\begin{array}{lcl}{\tau = 0:} & {q_1 =} & {q(0) =} & {\epsilon_1\Big(E_{b1} - \sum_{i = 1}^{N / 2}w_i'\mu_iI_i^- \Big),}\\ {} & {} & {}\\ {\tau = \tau_i:} & {q_2 = -q(\tau_i) = -\epsilon_2\Big(E_{b2} - \sum_{i = 1}^{N / 2}w_i'\mu_iI_i^+\Big).} \end{array} \tag{17.21b}
$$

Example 17.1. Consider two large, parallel, gray- diffuse and isothermal plates, separated by a distance  $L$ . One plate is at temperature  $T_{1}$  with emittance  $\epsilon_{1}$ , the other is at  $T_{2}$  with  $\epsilon_{2}$ . The medium between the two plates is a gray, absorbing/emitting and linear- anisotropically scattering gas  $(n = 1)$  with constant extinction coefficient  $\beta$  and single scattering albedo  $\omega$ . Assuming that radiative equilibrium prevails, determine the radiative heat flux between the two plates using the  $S_{2}$ - approximation.

# Solution

For radiative equilibrium we have, from equation (10.59),  $I_{b} = G / 4\pi$  and  $q = \text{const}$ ; equations (17.18) and (17.19) become

$$
\begin{array}{l}\mu_1\frac{dI_1^+}{d\tau} +I_1^+ = \frac{1}{4\pi} (G + A_1\omega \mu_1q),\\ -\mu_1\frac{dI_1^-}{d\tau} +I_1^- = \frac{1}{4\pi} (G - A_1\omega \mu_1q), \end{array}
$$

$$
\tau = 0:\quad I_1^+ = J_1 / \pi ,\qquad \tau = \beta L = \tau_L:\quad I_1^- = J_2 / \pi .
$$

For the  $S_{2}$ - approximation we have only a single ordinate direction  $\mu_{1}$  (pointing toward  $\tau_{L}$  for  $I_{1}^{+}$ , and toward 0 for  $I_{1}^{- }$ ), where  $\mu_{1} = 0.57735$  for the symmetric  $S_{2}$ - approximation, and  $\mu_{1} = 0.5$  for the nonsymmetric  $S_{2}$ - approximation [which satisfies the half- range moment, equation (17.13)]. For the simple

$S_{2}$ - approximation the simultaneous equations (only two in this case) may be separated. We do this here by eliminating  $I_{1}^{+}$  and  $I_{1}^{- }$  in favor of  $G$  and  $q$ . From equation (17.20), with  $w_{i}^{\prime} = 2\pi$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{G = 2\pi (I_1^+ +I_1^-),}\\ {q = 2\pi \mu_1(I_1^+ -I_1^-).} \end{array}
$$

Therefore, adding and subtracting the two differential equations and multiplying by  $2\pi$  leads to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\frac{dq}{d\tau} +G = G,\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \frac{dq}{d\tau} = 0,}\\ {\mu_1\frac{dG}{d\tau} +\frac{1}{\mu_1} q = A_1\omega \mu_1q,\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \frac{dG}{d\tau} = -\bigg(\frac{1}{\mu_1^2} -A_1\omega \bigg)q.} \end{array}
$$

The first equation is simply a restatement of radiative equilibrium, while the second may be integrated (since  $q = \mathrm{const}$ ), or

$$
G = C - \Big(\frac{1}{\mu_1^2} -A_1\omega \Big)q\tau .
$$

This relation contains two unknown constants ( $C$  and  $q$ ), which must be determined from the boundary conditions, that is,

$$
\begin{array}{rl}\tau = 0: & I_1^+ = \frac{1}{4\pi}\left(G + \frac{q}{\mu_1}\right) = J_1 / \pi ,\\ \tau = \tau_{\iota}: & I_1^- = \frac{1}{4\pi}\left(G - \frac{q}{\mu_1}\right) = J_2 / \pi ,\\ \tau = 0: & 4J_1 = G + \frac{q}{\mu_1} = C + \frac{q}{\mu_1},\\ \tau = \tau_{\iota}: & 4J_2 = G - \frac{q}{\mu_1} = C - \left(\frac{1}{\mu_1^2} -A_1\omega\right)q\tau_{\iota} - \frac{q}{\mu_1}. \end{array}
$$

Subtracting, we obtain,

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{J_1 - J_2} = \frac{2\mu_1}{1 + \left(1 / \mu_1^2 - A_1\omega\right)\mu_1\tau_{\iota} / 2},
$$

from which the radiosities may be eliminated through equation (14.48). For the symmetric  $S_{2}$ - approximation,  $\mu_{1} = 0.57735 = 1 / \sqrt{3}$ , and with isotropic scattering,  $A_{1} = 0$ , this expression becomes

$$
\Psi_{\mathrm{symmetric}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3} / 2 + 3\tau_{\iota} / 4}.
$$

On the other hand, for the nonsymmetric  $S_{2}$ - approximation ( $\mu_{1} = 0.5$ ), also with isotropic scattering,

$$
\Psi_{\mathrm{nonsymmetric}} = \frac{1}{1 + \tau_{\iota}}.
$$

The  $S_{2}$ - approximation is the same as the two- flux method discussed in Section 15.3, and the nonsymmetric  $S_{2}$ - method is nothing but the Schuster- Schwarzschild approximation. Results from the two  $S_{2}$ - approximations are compared in Table 17.3 with those from the  $P_{1}$ - approximation and the exact solution. It is seen that the accuracy of the  $S_{2}$ - method is roughly equivalent to that of the  $P_{1}$ - approximation. The nonsymmetric  $S_{2}$ - approximation is superior to the symmetric one, since the symmetric  $S_{2}$  does not satisfy the half- moment condition, equation (17.13), and causes substantial errors in the optically thin limit.

As a second example for the one- dimensional discrete ordinates method we shall repeat Example 16.4, which was originally designed to demonstrate the use of the  $P_{3}$ - approximation.

Example 17.2. Consider an isothermal medium at temperature  $T$ , confined between two large, parallel black plates that are isothermal at the (same) temperature  $T_{w}$ . The medium is gray and absorbs and

emits, but does not scatter. Determine an expression for the heat transfer rates within the medium using the  $S_{2}$  and  $S_{4}$  discrete ordinates approximations.

# Solution

For this particularly simple case equations (17.18) reduce to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\mu_i\frac{dI_i^+}{d\tau} = I_i = I_b,}\\ {-\mu_i\frac{dI_i^-}{d\tau} = I_i = I_b.} \end{array}
$$

Since  $I_{b} =$  const, these equations may be integrated right away, leading to

$$
\begin{array}{r}I_{i}^{+} = I_{b} + C^{+}e^{-\tau /\mu_{i}},\\ I_{i}^{-} = I_{b} + C^{-}e^{\tau /\mu_{i}}. \end{array}
$$

The integration constants  $C^+$  and  $C^-$  may be found from boundary conditions (17.19) as

$$
\begin{array}{rl}\tau = 0; & I_i^+ = I_{bw} = I_b + C^+,~\mathrm{or}~C^+ = I_{bw} - I_b;\\ \tau = \tau_i; & I_i^- = I_{bw} = I_b + C^- e^{\tau_L / \mu_i},~\mathrm{or}~C^- = (I_{bw} - I_b)e^{-\tau_L / \mu_i}. \end{array}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{r}I_i^+ = I_b + (I_{bw} - I_b)e^{-\tau /\mu_i},\\ I_i^- = I_b + (I_{bw} - I_b)e^{-(\tau_L - \tau) / \mu_i}. \end{array}
$$

The radiative heat flux follows then from equation (17.20) as

$$
q = \sum_{i = 1}^{N / 2}w_i^{\prime}\mu_i(l_{bw} - I_b)\left(e^{-\tau /\mu_i} - e^{-(\tau_L - \tau) / \mu_i}\right),
$$

or, in nondimensional form,

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{n^2\sigma(T_w^4 - T^4)} = \frac{1}{\pi}\sum_{i = 1}^{N / 2}w_i'\mu_i\left(e^{-\tau /\mu_i} - e^{-(\tau_L - \tau) / \mu_i}\right).
$$

For the nonsymmetric  $S_{2}$  - approximation we have  $w_{1}^{\prime} = 2\pi$  and  $\mu_{1} = 0.5,$  or

$$
\Psi_{S_2} = e^{-2\tau} - e^{-2(\tau_L - \tau)}.
$$

For the  $S_{4}$  - approximation,  $w_{1}^{\prime} = 4\pi /3$ $w_{2}^{\prime} = 2\pi /3$ $\mu_{1} = 0.2958759$ $\mu_{2} = 0.9082483,$  and  $\sum w_{i}^{\prime}\mu_{i} = \pi ,$  so that

$$
\Psi_{S_4} = 0.3945012\left(e^{-\tau /0.2958759} - e^{-(\tau_L - \tau) / 0.2958759}\right) + 0.6054088\left(e^{-\tau /0.9082483} - e^{-(\tau_L - \tau) / 0.9082483}\right).
$$

The results should be compared with those of Examples 16.2 and 16.4 for the  $P_{1}$  - and  $P_{3}$  - approximations. Note that the  $S_{N}$  - method goes to the correct optically thick limit  $(\tau_{L}\rightarrow \infty)$  at the wall, i.e.,  $\Psi \rightarrow 1$  [if the half moment of equation (17.13) is satisfied]. The  $P_{N}$  - approximations, on the other hand, overpredict the optically thick limit for this particular example.

It should be emphasized that this last example- - dealing with a nonscattering, isothermal medium- - is particularly well suited for the discrete ordinates method. One should not expect that, for a general problem, the  $S_{4}$  - method is easier to apply than the  $P_{3}$  - approximation.

A number of researchers have solved more complicated one- dimensional problems by the discrete ordinates method. Fiveland [12] considered the identical case as presented in this section, but allowed for arbitrarily anisotropic scattering. Solving the system of equations by a finite difference method, he noted that higher- order  $S_{N}$  - methods demand a smaller numerical step  $\Delta \tau$ , in order to obtain a stable solution. Kumar and coworkers [28] not only allowed arbitrarily anisotropic scattering, but also considered boundaries with specular reflectances as well as boundaries with collimated irradiation (as discussed in Chapter 19). To solve the set of simultaneous first- order differential equations they employed a subroutine from the IMSL software library [29], which is available on many computers. Stamnes and colleagues [30, 31] investigated the same problem as Kumar and coworkers but also allowed for variable radiative properties and a general bidirectional reflection function at the surfaces. They decoupled the set of simultaneous equations using methods of linear algebra and found exact analytical solutions in terms of eigenvalues and eigenvectors that, in turn, were determined using the EISPACK software library [32]. Other examples of the use of the one- dimensional discrete ordinates model as a tool to solve more complex problems may be found in [33- 42].

# 17.4 ONE-DIMENSIONAL CONCENTRIC SPHERES AND CYLINDERS

Applying the discrete ordinates method and taking advantage of the symmetries in a one- dimensional problem is considerably more difficult for concentric spheres and cylinders than for a plane- parallel slab. The reason is that the local direction cosines change while traveling along a straight line of sight through such enclosures.

# Concentric Spheres

Consider two concentric spheres of radius  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$ , respectively. The inner sphere surface has an emittance  $\epsilon_{1}$  and is kept isothermal at temperature  $T_{1}$ , while the outer sphere is at temperature  $T_{2}$  with emittance  $\epsilon_{2}$ . If the temperature within the medium is a function of radius only, then the equation of transfer is given by equation (14.69),

$$
\mu \frac{\partial I}{\partial r} +\frac{1 - \mu^2}{r}\frac{\partial I}{\partial\mu} +\beta I = \beta S, \tag{17.22a}
$$

or, alternatively,

$$
\frac{\mu}{r^2}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} (r^2 I) + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial\mu}\left[(1 - \mu^2)I\right] + \beta I = \beta S, \tag{17.22b}
$$

where  $\mu = \cos \theta$  is the cosine of the polar angle, measured from the radial direction (see Fig. 14- 5).  $S$  is the radiative source function,

$$
S(r,\mu) = (1 - \omega)I_b + \frac{\omega}{2}\int_{-1}^{1}I(r,\mu ')\Phi (\mu ,\mu ')d\mu ', \tag{17.23a}
$$

or

$$
S(r,\mu) = (1 - \omega)I_b + \frac{\omega}{4\pi} (G + A_1q\mu), \tag{17.23b}
$$

FIGURE 17-1 Directional discretization and discrete ordinate values for one-dimensional problems.

if the scattering is limited to the linear- anisotropic case. The additional difficulty lies in the fact that equation (17.22) contains a derivative over direction cosine,  $\mu$ , that is to be discretized in the discrete ordinates method. Applying the  $S_{N}$ - method to equation (17.22), we obtain

$$
\frac{\mu_i}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr} (r^2 I_i) + \frac{1}{r}\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial\mu}\left[(1 - \mu^2)I\right]\right\}_{\mu = \mu_i} + \beta I_i = \beta S_i,i = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{17.24}
$$

where  $S_{i}$  is readily determined from equation (17.23) (and is independent of ordinate direction unless the medium scatters anisotropically). Equation (17.24) is only applied to the  $N$  principal ordinates since, similar to the slab, there is no azimuthal dependence. Since the direction vector  $\mu$  is discretized, its derivative must be approximated by finite differences. We may write

$$
\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial\mu}\left[(1 - \mu^2)I\right]\right\}_{\mu = \mu_i}\simeq \frac{\alpha_{i + 1 / 2}I_{i + 1 / 2} - \alpha_{i - 1 / 2}I_{i - 1 / 2}}{w_i'}, \tag{17.25}
$$

which is a central difference with the  $I_{i\pm 1 / 2}$  evaluated at the boundaries between two ordinates, as shown in Fig. 17- 1. Since the differences between any two sequential  $\mu_{i}$  are nonuniform, the geometrical coefficients  $\alpha$  are nonconstant and need to be determined. The values of  $\alpha$  depend only on the differencing scheme and, therefore, are independent of intensity and may be determined by examining a particularly simple intensity field. For example, if both spheres are at the same temperature, then  $I_{b1} = I_{b2} = I_{b} = \mathrm{const},$  and also  $I = I_{b} = \mathrm{const}$ . This then leads to

$$
\alpha_{i + 1 / _2} - \alpha_{i - 1 / _2} = w_i'\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial\mu} (1 - \mu^2)\right]_{\mu = \mu_i} = -2w_i'\mu_i,i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{17.26}
$$

This expression may be used as a recursion formula for  $\alpha_{i + 1 / 2},$  if a value for  $\alpha_{1 / 2}$  can be determined. That value is found by noting that  $I_{1 / 2}$  is evaluated at  $\mu = - 1$  (Fig. 17- 1), where  $(1 - \mu^{2})I = 0$  and,

therefore,  $\alpha_{1 / 2} = 0$ . Similarly,  $I_{N + 1 / 2}$  is evaluated at  $\mu = +1$  and also  $\alpha_{N + 1 / 2} = 0$ . The finite- difference scheme of equations (17.25) and (17.26) satisfies the relation [4]

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\int_{-1}^{+1}\frac{\partial}{\partial\mu}\left[(1 - \mu^2)I\right]d\mu = (1 - \mu^2)I\bigg|_{-1}^{+1} = 0}\\ & {\quad = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}w_i^{\prime}\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial\mu}\left[(1 - \mu^2)I\right]\right\}_{\mu = \mu_i} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}\left(\alpha_{i + 1 / 2}I_{i + 1 / 2} - \alpha_{i - 1 / 2}I_{i - 1 / 2}\right)}\\ & {\quad = \alpha_{31}I_{3 / 2} - \alpha_{1 / 2}I_{1 / 2} + \alpha_{5 / 2}I_{5 / 2} - \alpha_{3 / 2}I_{3 / 2} + \dots \cdot \alpha_{N + 1 / 2}I_{N + 1 / 2} - \alpha_{N + 1 / 2}I_{N - 1 / 2}}\\ & {\quad = 0.} \end{array}
$$

Finally, the intensities at the node boundaries,  $I_{i\pm 1 / 2},$  need to be expressed in terms of node center values,  $I_{i}$  . We shall use here simple, linear averaging, i.e.,  $I_{i + 1 / 2}\simeq \frac{1}{2} (I_i + I_{i + 1})$  . Equation (17.24) may now be rewritten as

$$
\frac{\mu_i}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr} (r^2 I_i) + \frac{\alpha_{i + 1 / 2}I_{i + 1} + (\alpha_{i + 1 / 2} - \alpha_{i - 1 / 2})I_i - \alpha_{i - 1 / 2}I_{i - 1}}{2rw_i'} +\beta I_i = \beta S_i,
$$

or, carrying out the differentiation and using equation (17.26),

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\mu_i\frac{dI_i}{dr} +\frac{\mu_i}{r} I_i + \frac{\alpha_{i + 1 / 2}I_{i + 1} - \alpha_{i - 1 / 2}I_{i - 1}}{2rw_i'} +\beta I_i = \beta S_i,}\\ {\alpha_{i + 1 / 2} = \alpha_{i - 1 / 2} - 2w_i'\mu_i,\quad \alpha_{1 / 2} = \alpha_{N + 1 / 2} = 0,\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N.} \end{array} \tag{17.27b}
$$

Equations (17.27) constitute a set of  $N$  simultaneous differential equations in the  $N$  unknown intensities  $I_{i},$  subject to the boundary conditions [cf. equation (17.19)]

$$
\begin{array}{l}{r = R_1:I_i = I_1 / \pi = I_{b1} - \frac{1 - \epsilon_1}{\epsilon_1\pi} q_1,i = \frac{N}{2} +1,\frac{N}{2} +2,\ldots ,N(\mu_i > 0),}\\ {r = R_2:I_i = I_2 / \pi = I_{b2} + \frac{1 - \epsilon_2}{\epsilon_2\pi} q_2,i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{N}{2} (\mu_i< 0).} \end{array} \tag{17.28b}
$$

As for the one- dimensional slab the radiative heat flux and incident radiation are evaluated [cf. equations (17.20) and (17.21)] from

$$
\begin{array}{l}{G(r) = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}w_{i}^{\prime}I_{i}(r),}\\ {q(r) = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}w_{i}^{\prime}\mu_{i}I_{i}(r),} \end{array} \tag{17.29b}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{c}{q(R_1) = q_1 = \epsilon_1\big(E_{b1} + \sum_{i = 1\atop (\mu_i< 0)}^{N / 2}w_i'\mu_iI_i\big),}\\ {-q(R_2) = q_2 = \epsilon_2\big(E_{b2} - \sum_{i = N / 2 + 1\atop (\mu_i > 0)}^{N}w_i'\mu_iI_i\big).} \end{array} \tag{17.29d}
$$

Example 17.3. Consider a nonscattering medium at radiative equilibrium that is contained between two isothermal, gray spheres. The absorption coefficient of the medium may be assumed to be gray

and constant. Using the  $S_{2}$ - approximation determine the radiative heat flux between the two concentric spheres.

# Solution

From equation (17.27) we find, with  $N = 2$ , that  $\alpha_{1 / 2} = \alpha_{3 / 2} = 0$ ,  $\alpha_{3 / 2} = - 2w_{1}^{\prime}\mu_{1} = 2w_{2}^{\prime}\mu_{2} = 4\pi \mu$  (since  $\mu_{2} = - \mu_{1} > 0$ ; we keep  $\mu = \mu_{2}$  as a nonnumerical value to allow comparison between the symmetric and nonsymmetric  $S_{2}$ - approximations). For a gray, nonscattering medium at radiative equilibrium we have  $\beta = \kappa$  and  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = 0$ , and the source function is, from equations (10.61) and (17.39),  $S = I_{b} = G / 4\pi$ .

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{i = 1:} & {-\mu \frac{dI_1}{d\tau} -\frac{\mu}{\tau} I_1 + \frac{\mu}{\tau} I_2 + I_1 = \frac{G}{4\pi} = \frac{1}{2} (I_1 + I_2),}\\ & {-\mu \frac{dI_1}{d\tau} -\left(\frac{\mu}{\tau} -\frac{1}{2}\right)(I_1 - I_2) = 0,}\\ {i = 2:} & {\mu \frac{dI_2}{d\tau} +\frac{\mu}{\tau} I_2 - \frac{\mu}{\tau} I_1 + I_2 = \frac{1}{2} (I_1 + I_2),}\\ & {\mu \frac{dI_2}{d\tau} -\left(\frac{\mu}{\tau} +\frac{1}{2}\right)(I_1 - I_2) = 0.} \end{array}
$$

While addition of the two equations simply leads to a restatement of radiative equilibrium (as in Example 17.1), subtracting them (and multiplying by  $w_{i}^{\prime} = 2\pi$ ) leads to

or

$$
\begin{array}{c}{-\mu \frac{d}{d\tau} [2\pi (I_1 + I_2)] + 2\pi (I_1 - I_2) = 0,}\\ {\frac{dG}{d\tau} = -\frac{q}{\mu^2} = -\frac{\tau^2q}{\mu^2}\frac{1}{\tau^2}.} \end{array}
$$

Since for a medium at radiative equilibrium between concentric spheres  $Q = 4\pi r^{2}q = \text{const}$  and, therefore,  $\tau^{2}q = \text{const}$ , the incident radiation may be found by integration,

$$
G(\tau) = \frac{\tau^2q}{\mu^2}\frac{1}{\tau} +C,
$$

where the two constants  $(\tau^{2}q)$  and  $C$  are still unknown and must be determined from the boundary conditions, equations (17.28):

$$
I_{2}(\tau_{1}) = J_{1} / \pi ,I_{1}(\tau_{2}) = J_{2} / \pi .
$$

Using the definitions for  $q$  and  $G$ , equations (17.29),

$$
q = 2\pi \mu (I_2 - I_1)\quad \mathrm{and}\quad G = 2\pi (I_2 + I_1),
$$

or

$$
I_{1} = \frac{1}{4\pi}\left(G - \frac{q}{\mu}\right),I_{2} = \frac{1}{4\pi}\left(G + \frac{q}{\mu}\right),
$$

the boundary conditions may be restated in terms of  $q$  and  $G$  as

$$
\begin{array}{rl}\tau = \tau_1: & 4J_1 = G + \frac{q_1}{\mu} = \frac{\tau_1q_1}{\mu^2} +C + \frac{q_1}{\mu} = \frac{\tau^2q}{\mu^2}\bigg(\frac{1}{\tau_1} +\frac{\mu}{\tau_1^2}\bigg) + C,\\ \tau = \tau_2: & 4J_2 = G - \frac{q_2}{\mu} = \frac{\tau_2q_2}{\mu^2} +C - \frac{q_2}{\mu} = \frac{\tau^2q}{\mu^2}\bigg(\frac{1}{\tau_2} -\frac{\mu}{\tau_2^2}\bigg) + C. \end{array}
$$

Subtracting the second boundary condition from the first we obtain

$$
\Psi = \frac{\tau^2}{\tau_1^2}\frac{q}{J_1 - J_2} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{4\mu}\big(1 + \frac{\tau_1^2}{\tau_2^2}\big) + \frac{\tau_1}{4\mu^2}\big(1 - \frac{\tau_1}{\tau_2}\big)}.
$$

For the symmetric  $S_{2}$ - approximation, with  $\mu = 1 / \sqrt{3}$ , this equation becomes

$$
\Psi_{\mathrm{symmetric}} = \frac{1}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}\left(1 + \frac{\tau_1^2}{\tau_2^2}\right) + \frac{3\tau_1}{4}\left(1 - \frac{\tau_1}{\tau_2}\right)},
$$

and for the nonsymmetric approximation with  $\mu = 0.5$ ,

$$
\Psi_{\mathrm{nonsymmetric}} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \frac{\tau_1^2}{\tau_2^2}\right) + \tau_1\left(1 - \frac{\tau_1}{\tau_2}\right)}.
$$

The accuracy of the  $S_{2}$ - approximation is very similar to that of the  $P_{1}$ - approximation, for which

$$
\Psi_{P_1} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \frac{\tau_1^2}{\tau_2^2}\right) + \frac{3\tau_1}{4}\left(1 - \frac{\tau_1}{\tau_2}\right)}.
$$

Note that the method is very accurate for large  $\tau_{1}$  (large optical thickness) but breaks down for optically thin conditions  $(\kappa \rightarrow 0)$ , in particular for small ratios of radii,  $R_{1} / R_{2}$ . In the limit  $(\kappa \rightarrow 0, R_{1} / R_{2} \rightarrow 0)$  we find  $\Psi_{P_{1}} = \Psi_{S_{2,\mathrm{nonsym}} \rightarrow 2}$ , while the correct limit should go to  $\Psi_{\mathrm{exact}} \rightarrow 1$ .

Numerical solutions to equations (17.27), allowing for anisotropic scattering, variable properties, and external irradiation, have been reported by Tsai and colleagues [43] using the  $S_{8}$  discrete ordinates method with the equal- weight ordinates of Fiveland [12]. The same method was used by Jones and Bayazitoglu [44,45] to determine the combined effects of conduction and radiation through a spherical shell.

# Concentric Cylinders

The analysis for two concentric cylinders follows along similar lines. Again we consider an absorbing, emitting, and scattering medium contained between two isothermal cylinders with radii  $R_{1}$  (temperature  $T_{1}$ , diffuse emittance  $\epsilon_{1}$ ) and  $R_{2}$  (temperature  $T_{2}$ , emittance  $\epsilon_{2}$ ), respectively. For this case the equation of transfer is given by equation (14.88),

$$
\sin \theta \cos \psi \frac{\partial I}{\partial r} -\frac{\sin\theta\sin\psi}{r}\frac{\partial I}{\partial\psi} +\beta I = \beta S, \tag{17.30}
$$

where polar angle  $\theta$  is measured from the  $z$ - axis, and azimuthal angle  $\psi$  is measured from the local radial direction (cf. Fig. 14- 6).  $S$  is the radiative source function and has been given by equation (17.23). Introducing the direction cosines  $\xi = \hat{\mathbf{s}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{z} = \cos \theta$ ,  $\mu = \hat{\mathbf{s}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{r} = \sin \theta \cos \psi$ , and  $\eta = \hat{\mathbf{s}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{e}}_{\psi_{c}} = \sin \theta \sin \psi$ , we may rewrite equation (17.30) as

$$
\frac{\mu}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r} (rI) - \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial\psi} (\eta I) + \beta I = \beta S. \tag{17.31}
$$

For a one- dimensional cylindrical medium the symmetry conditions are not as straightforward as for slabs and spheres. Here we have

$$
I(r,\theta ,\psi) = I(r,\pi -\theta ,\psi) = I(r,\theta , - \psi). \tag{17.32}
$$

Therefore, the intensity is the same for positive and negative values of  $\xi$ , as well as for positive and negative values of  $\eta$ . Thus, we only need to consider positive values for  $\xi_{i}$  and  $\eta_{i}$  from Table 17.1, leading to  $N_{c} = N(N + 2) / 4$  different ordinates for the  $S_{N}$ - approximation, with

quadrature weights  $w_{i}^{\prime \prime} = 4w_{i}$ . Equation (17.31) may then be written in discrete ordinates form as

$$
\frac{\mu_i}{r}\frac{d}{dr} (rI_i) - \frac{1}{r}\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial\psi} (\eta I)\right\}_{\psi = \psi_i} + \beta I_i = \beta S_i,i = 1,2,\ldots ,N_c. \tag{17.33}
$$

As for the concentric spheres case the term in braces is approximated as

$$
\left\{\frac{\partial}{\partial\psi} (\eta I)\right\}_{\psi = \psi_i}\simeq \frac{\alpha_{i + 1 / 2}I_{i + 1 / 2} - \alpha_{i - 1 / 2}I_{i - 1 / 2}}{w_i^{\prime\prime}},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N_i,\xi_i\mathrm{fixed}. \tag{17.34}
$$

In this relation the subscript  $i + 1 / 2$  implies "toward the next higher value of  $\psi_{i},$  keeping  $\xi_{i}$  constant." The value of  $N_{i}$  depends on the value of  $\xi_{i}$  . For example, for the  $S_{4}$  - approximation we have from Table  $17.1N_{i} = 4$  for  $\xi_{i} = 0.2958759$  (four different values for  $\mu_{i},$  two positive and two negative) and  $N_{i} = 2$  for  $\xi_{i} = 0.9082483$  . In the case of concentric cylinders the recursion formula for  $\alpha ,$  by letting  $I = S =$  const in equation (17.31), is obtained as

$$
\alpha_{i + 1 / 2} - \alpha_{i - 1 / 2} = w_i^{\prime \prime}\left.\frac{\partial\eta}{\partial\psi}\right|_{\psi = \psi_i} = w_i^{\prime \prime}\mu_i,i = 1,2,\ldots ,N_i,\xi_i\mathrm{fixed}. \tag{17.35}
$$

Again,  $\alpha_{1 / 2} = 0$  since at that location  $\psi_{1 / 2} = 0$  and, therefore,  $\eta = 0$  . Similarly,  $\alpha_{N_i + 1 / 2} = 0$  since  $\psi_{N_i + 1 / 2} = \pi$  and  $\eta = 0$  . Finally, using linear averaging for the half- node intensities leads to

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\mu_i\frac{dI_i}{dr} +\frac{\mu_i}{2r} I_i - \frac{\alpha_{i + 1 / 2}I_{i + 1} - \alpha_{i - 1 / 2}I_{i - 1}}{2rw_i^{\prime\prime}} +\beta I_i = \beta S_i,i = 1,2,\ldots ,N_c,}\\ {\alpha_{i + 1 / 2} = \alpha_{i - 1 / 2} + w_i^{\prime \prime}\mu_i,\quad \alpha_{1 / 2} = \alpha_{N + 1 / 2} = 0,i = 1,2,\ldots ,N_i,\xi_i\mathrm{fixed}.} \end{array} \tag{17.36b}
$$

Equation (17.36) is the set of equations for concentric cylinders, for the  $N_{c} = N(N + 2) / 4$  unknown directional intensities  $I_{i},$  and is equivalent to the set for concentric spheres, equation (17.27). The boundary conditions for cylinders and spheres are basically identical [equations (17.28)], except for some renumbering, as are the expressions for incident intensity and radiative heat flux [equations (17.29)], that is,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{r = R_1:\quad I_i = \frac{J_1}{\pi} = I_{b1} - \frac{1 - \epsilon_1}{\epsilon_1\pi} q_1,\quad i = \frac{N_c}{2} +1,\frac{N_c}{2} +2,\ldots ,N_c(\mu_i > 0),}\\ {r = R_2:\quad I_i = \frac{J_2}{\pi} = I_{b2} + \frac{1 - \epsilon_2}{\epsilon_2\pi} q_2,\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,\frac{N_c}{2} (\mu_i< 0),}\\ {G(r) = \sum_{i = 1}^{N_c}w_i^{\prime \prime}I_i(r),}\\ {q(r) = \sum_{i = 1}^{N_c}w_i^{\prime \prime}\mu_iI_i(r),} \end{array} \tag{17.37d}
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{c}{q(R_1) = q_1 = \epsilon_1\big(E_{b1} + \sum_{i = 1\atop (\mu_i< 0)}^{N_c / 2}w_i^{\prime \prime}\mu_iI_i\big),}\\ {-q(R_2) = q_2 = \epsilon_2\big(E_{b2} - \sum_{i = N_c / 2 + 1\atop (\mu_i > 0)}^{N_c}w_i^{\prime \prime}\mu_iI_i\big).} \end{array} \tag{17.37f}
$$

An example of the use of the discrete ordinates method in a one- dimensional medium is the work of Krishnaprakas [46], who considered combined conduction and radiation in a gray, constant property medium with various scattering behaviors.

# 17.5 MULTIDIMENSIONAL PROBLEMS

While the discrete ordinates method is readily extended to multidimensional configurations, the method results in a set of simultaneous first- order partial differential equations that generally must be solved numerically. As for one- dimensional geometries, the equation of transfer is slightly different whether a Cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical coordinate system is employed. We shall first describe the method for Cartesian coordinate systems, followed by a brief description of the differences for cylindrical and spherical geometries.

# Enclosures Described by Cartesian Coordinates

For Cartesian coordinates equation (17.4) becomes, using equation (17.14),

$$
\xi_{i}\frac{\partial I_{i}}{\partial x} +n_{i}\frac{\partial I_{i}}{\partial y} +\mu_{i}\frac{\partial I_{i}}{\partial z} +\beta I_{i} = \beta S_{i},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,n, \tag{17.38}
$$

where  $S_{i}$  is again shorthand for the radiative source function

$$
S_{i} = (1 - \omega)I_{b} + \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\sum_{j = 1}^{n}w_{j}\Phi_{ij}I_{j},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,n. \tag{17.39}
$$

Equation (17.38) is subject to the boundary conditions in equation (17.5) along each surface. For example, for a surface parallel to the  $y - z$ - plane, with  $\hat{\mathbf{n}} = \hat{\mathbf{1}}$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_j = \hat{\mathbf{s}}_j\cdot \hat{\mathbf{1}} = \xi_j$ , we have for all  $i$  with  $\xi_{i} > 0$  ( $n / 2$  boundary conditions)

$$
I_{i} = J_{w} / \pi = \epsilon_{w}I_{bw} + \frac{1 - \epsilon_{w}}{\pi}\sum_{\xi_{j}< 0}w_{j}I_{j}|\xi_{j}|. \tag{17.40}
$$

Although the numerical solution to equation (17.38) may be found through standard finite differences, the first order of the equations necessitates backward differencing with large truncation errors. Consequently, it is more common to employ the finite- volume approach of Carlson and Lathrop [4] described below.

# Two-Dimensional Problems

For clarity, we shall develop the method here for a two- dimensional geometry (i.e., for  $\partial I / \partial z\equiv 0$ ). For such a problem the intensity is the same for positive and negative values of  $\mu_{i}$ . Thus, we need to consider only positive values of  $\mu_{i}$  (and double the quadrature weights  $w_{i}$ ). A general volume element is shown in Fig. 17- 2. The volume element has four face areas  $A_{W}$  and  $A_{E}$  (in the  $x$ - direction), and  $A_{S}$  and  $A_{N}$  (in the  $y$ - direction). In a simple rectangular enclosure one

![](images/481105eca9666fa485f102c77f774522a4a9a604ba2adb10e5f53a90a7ae3d28.jpg)  
FIGURE 17-3 Enclosure corner, used as starting point for discrete ordinates calculations.

would have (per unit length in the  $z$ - direction)  $A_{W} = A_{E} = \Delta y$ ,  $A_{S} = A_{N} = \Delta x$ , and  $V = \Delta x\Delta y$ . The finite- volume formulation of equation (17.38) is obtained by integrating it over a volume element. For example, the term  $\partial I_{i} / \partial x$  transforms to

$$
\int_{V}\frac{\partial I_{i}}{\partial x} dV = \int_{A_{E}}I_{i}dA_{E} - \int_{A_{W}}I_{i}dA_{W} = I_{Ei}A_{E} - I_{Wi}A_{Wi}, \tag{17.41}
$$

where  $I_{Ei}$  and  $I_{Wi}$  are average values of  $I_{i}$  over the faces of  $A_{E}$  and  $A_{W}$ , respectively. Operating similarly on the other terms changes equation (17.38) to

$$
\xi_{i}(A_{E}I_{Ei} - A_{W}I_{Wi}) + \eta_{i}(A_{N}I_{Ni} - A_{S}I_{Si}) = -\beta VI_{pi} + \beta VS_{pi}, \tag{17.42}
$$

where  $I_{ni}$  and  $S_{ni}$  are volume averages. The number of unknowns in equation (17.42) may be reduced by relating cell- edge intensities to the volume- averaged intensity. Most often a linear relationship is chosen, i.e.,

$$
I_{pi} = \gamma_yI_{Ni} + (1 - \gamma_y)I_{Si} = \gamma_xI_{Ei} + (1 - \gamma_x)I_{Wi}, \tag{17.43}
$$

in which  $\gamma_{x}$  and  $\gamma_{y}$  are constants  $\frac{1}{2}\leq \gamma_{x},\gamma_{y}\leq 1,$  and the scheme is known as "weighted diamond differencing" as proposed by Carlson and Lathrop [4]. To date most investigators have employed  $\gamma_{x} = \gamma_{y} = \frac{1}{2}$ , simply known as the diamond scheme.

For any point on a surface, boundary conditions are given for all directions pointing away from the surface. Therefore, the numerical solution of equation (17.38) customarily proceeds as follows: First, the surface radiosities,  $J_{w}$ , and internal radiative source terms,  $S_{i}$ , are estimated (usually by neglecting reflected surface irradiation and volume in- scattering during the first iteration). Next, the lower left corner (corresponding to minimum values of  $x$  and  $y$ , as indicated in Fig. 17- 3) is chosen as a starting point. From that point all outgoing directions lie in the first quadrant (i.e., both direction cosines  $\xi_{i}$  and  $\eta_{i}$  are positive). The West and South faces of the control volume in that corner are part of the enclosure surface and, therefore, their intensities  $I_{Wi}$  and  $I_{Si}$  are known from the boundary conditions. For any discrete ordinate  $i$ , the volume- averaged intensity,  $I_{pi}$ , of the corner control volume can be calculated by eliminating  $I_{Ei}$  and  $I_{Ni}$  from equation (17.42) with the help of equation (17.43). Thus,

$$
\gamma_{x}(A_{E}I_{Ei} - A_{W}I_{Wi}) = A_{E}I_{pi} - [(1 - \gamma_{x})A_{E} + \gamma_{x}A_{W}]I_{Wi},
$$

etc., and

$$
I_{pi} = \frac{\beta VS_{pi} + \xi_iA_{EW}I_{Wi} / \gamma_x + \eta_iA_{NS}I_{Si} / \gamma_y}{\beta V + \xi_iA_E / \gamma_x + \eta_iA_N / \gamma_y}, \tag{17.44}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{r}A_{EW} = (1 - \gamma_x)A_E + \gamma_xA_W,\\ A_{NS} = (1 - \gamma_y)A_N + \gamma_yA_S, \end{array} \tag{17.45b}
$$

are averaged face areas. Once  $I_{pi}$  has been calculated,  $I_{Ei}$  and  $I_{Ni}$  are readily determined from equation (17.43), and are equal to the West and South intensities for the adjacent control volumes (for increasing  $x$  and  $y$ ); thus, one by one, the first- quadrant intensities can be calculated for all finite volumes in the enclosure. The procedure is then repeated three times, starting from the remaining three corners of the enclosure, covering the remaining three quadrants of directions. For example, for  $\xi_{i} < 0$ , the intensity at the East face of the control volume is known, and the West face intensity must be eliminated from equation (17.42), to be determined after  $I_{pi}$  has been found. Thus, we may rewrite equations (17.42) and (17.43) for general (positive or negative) values of  $\xi_{i}$  and  $\eta_{i}$  as

$$
|\xi_{i}|(A_{x_{e}}I_{x_{e}i} - A_{x_{i}}I_{x_{i}i}) + |\eta_{i}|(A_{y_{e}}I_{y_{e}i} - A_{y_{i}}I_{y_{i}i}) = -\beta V I_{pi} + \beta V S_{i}, \tag{17.46}
$$

$$
I_{pi} = \gamma_{x}I_{x_{e}i} + (1 - \gamma_{x})I_{x_{i}i} = \gamma_{y}I_{y_{e}i} + (1 - \gamma_{y})I_{y_{i}i} \tag{17.47}
$$

where  $A_{x_i}$  is the  $x$ - direction face area where the beam enters ( $= A_W$  for  $\xi_{i} > 0$ , and  $= A_E$  for  $\xi_{i} < 0$ ),  $A_{x_e}$  is the  $x$ - direction face area through which the beam exits ( $= A_E$  for  $\xi_{i} > 0$ , and  $= A_W$  for  $\xi_{i} < 0$ ),  $I_{y_{i}i}$  and  $I_{y_{i}j}$  are the corresponding  $y$ - direction face intensities, and so on. Then equation (17.44) may be generalized to

$$
I_{pi} = \frac{\beta VS_{pi} + |\xi_i|A_xI_{x_i} / \gamma_x + |\eta_i|A_yI_{y_i} / \gamma_y}{\beta V + |\xi_i|A_{x_e} / \gamma_x + |\eta_i|A_{y_e} / \gamma_y}, \tag{17.48}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{c}{A_x = (1 - \gamma_x)A_{x_e} + \gamma_xA_{x_i},}\\ {A_y = (1 - \gamma_y)A_{y_e} + \gamma_yA_{y_i}.} \end{array} \tag{17.49b}
$$

If all walls are black and in the absence of scattering, all unknown quantities can be calculated with a single pass, since all wall radiosities,  $J_{w}$ , and all internal sources  $S_{pi} = (I_b)_pi$  are known a priori (if the temperature field is given or assumed). If the walls are reflecting and/or the medium is scattering, iterations are necessary. After a pass over all directions and over all finite volumes has been completed, the values for the wall radiosities and the radiative source terms are updated, and the procedure is repeated until convergence criteria are met. And finally, internal values of incident radiation and radiative heat flux are determined from equations (17.6) and (17.7), while heat fluxes at the walls may be calculated from equations (17.8). For highly reflecting walls ( $\epsilon_w \ll 1$ ) and strongly scattering media ( $1 - \omega \ll 1$ ), the discrete ordinates method will become extremely inefficient. As pointed out by Chai and coworkers [47], the number of iterations caused by scattering can be reduced by removing forward scattering from the phase function, and treating it as transmission. This can be done in equations (17.38) and (17.39) by defining a modified extinction coefficient and a modified source as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\beta_{mi} = \beta -\frac{\sigma_s}{4\pi} w_i\Phi_{ii},\\ \displaystyle S_{mi} = (1 - \omega)I_b + \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\sum_{j = 1\atop j\neq i}^{n}w_j\Phi_{ij}I_j,i = 1,2,\dots,n. \end{array} \tag{17.51}
$$

This leads to faster convergence, particularly if the phase function has a strong forward peak (as is often the case for large particles; see also the discussion in Section 12.9).

# Spatial Differencing Schemes

Expressing unknown intensities in terms of upstream values, such as defining  $I_{Ni}$  and  $I_{Ei}$  in terms of  $I_{pi}$ ,  $I_{Si}$ , and  $I_{Wi}$  in equation (17.43) for  $\xi_{i}$ ,  $\eta_{i} > 0$ , is known as spatial differencing (of intensity). Many different schemes have been proposed over the years. We give here only a brief description of the most basic and popular ones.

Step Scheme The step scheme is the simplest differencing scheme, setting  $\gamma_{x} = \gamma_{y} = 1,$  which leads to  $I_{Ni} = I_{pi}$  and  $I_{Ei} = I_{pi}$  for  $\xi_{i},\eta_{i} > 0,$  etc. Akin to a fully implicit finite difference of a first derivative, it has the largest truncation error of all methods, but is the only one that never produces unphysical results.

Diamond Scheme This is the most popular differencing scheme, in which the interpolation factors are set to  $\begin{array}{r}\gamma_{x} = \gamma_{y} = \frac{1}{2} \end{array}$  . However, already Carlson and Lathrop [4] noticed that this may lead to physically impossible negative intensities at the control volume faces (i.e.,  $I_{Ni}$  and  $I_{Ei}$  for  $\xi_{i},\eta_{i} > 0,$  etc.). While they simply suggest setting negative intensities to zero and continuing computations, this may lead to oscillations and instability. Fiveland [13] showed that such negative intensities may be minimized (but not totally avoided) if finite volume dimensions are kept within

$$
\Delta x< \frac{|\xi_{i}|_{\min}}{\beta(1 - \gamma_{x})},\quad \Delta y< \frac{|\eta_{i}|_{\min}}{\beta(1 - \gamma_{y})}. \tag{17.52}
$$

Therefore, higher- order  $S_{N}$  - approximations (with their smaller minimum value for  $\xi_{i}$  and  $\eta_{i}$  as well as optically thick media (large  $\beta$  ), require finer volumetric meshes. However, Chai and coworkers [48] have demonstrated that a fine mesh does not guarantee positive intensities, but may in fact cause negative intensities. They further noticed that the diamond scheme may result in "overshoot," i.e., predicting unphysically high intensity (intensity leaving a control volume larger than intensity entering plus internal emission).

Exponential Scheme The exponential scheme [4] is generally regarded to be more accurate, particularly for one- dimensional geometries. Here

$$
\gamma_{x} = \frac{1}{1 - e^{-\tau_{si}}} = \frac{1}{\tau_{si}},\quad s = x\mathrm{or}y;\quad \tau_{si} = \frac{\beta\Delta x}{\xi_{i}},\quad \tau_{yi} = \frac{\beta\Delta y}{\eta_{i}}. \tag{17.53}
$$

Since equation (17.53) leads to interpolation factors less than unity, this method also can lead to physically impossible intensities.

Other relatively simple differencing schemes have been proposed, such as the positive scheme (Lathrop [49]), a variable- weight scheme (Jamaluddin and Smith [50]), an upstream tracing scheme (Chai and colleagues [48]), and a hybrid scheme (Kim and Kim [51]). These methods are somewhat more complex, and have smaller truncation error. However, unlike the simple step scheme they all can lead to unphysical results.

CLAM Scheme The CLAM scheme is a second- order method and, therefore, does not obey equation (17.43). The method is a bounded scheme originally developed for fluid flow problems, and was first applied to radiative heat transfer by Jessee and Fiveland [52]. The intensity exiting the control volume at face  $f$  (where  $f = W,N,E,$  or  $S$  ) is expressed in terms of  $I_{p}$  and center values of adjacent volume elements in the upstream  $(I_{u})$  and downstream  $(I_d)$  directions:

$$
I_{f} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}I_{p} + \phi (I_{d} - I_{p}), & 0\leq \phi \leq 1,\\ I_{p}, & \mathrm{otherwise}, \end{array} \right. \tag{17.54}
$$

where

$$
\phi = \frac{I_p - I_u}{I_d - I_u}. \tag{17.55}
$$

In the context of Fig. 17- 2 for the given direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i,$  intensity exits the  $N$  face (with  $d$  being the volume element above  $N,$  and  $u$  the volume element below  $S$  ) and the  $E$  face (with  $d$  being the volume element to the right of  $E,$  and  $u$  the one to the left of  $W$  ). Intensity entering the  $S$  face exits the  $N$  face of the volume element below and equation (17.54) is applied to that element, etc.

Since high- order schemes, such as CLAM, make the set of equations nonlinear, the intensity propagating along a single direction can no longer be evaluated in a single sweep, even in the absence of scattering and/or wall reflection. The equations must be linearized and a solution

is found through iteration, mostly using the "deferred correction" procedure [18]. For the  $n$ th iteration equation (17.54) is modified to

$$
I_{f}^{n} = I_{p}^{n} + \phi^{n - 1}(I_{d}^{n - 1} - I_{p}^{n - 1}), \tag{17.56}
$$

i.e., the first term on the right-hand side is treated implicitly (using the step scheme,  $\gamma_{x} = \gamma_{y} = 1$ ), while the remainder is explicit (taking values from the previous iteration, provided  $0 \leq \phi^{n - 1} \leq 1$ ). This way equation (17.48) remains in effect, but includes additional source terms stemming from the explicit terms in equation (17.56).

The CLAM scheme belongs to the class of bounded, high- resolution interpolation schemes based on the Normalized Variable Diagram (NVD) formulation proposed by Leonard [53]. The CLAM scheme is known to be stable and fairly economical and, while other NVD schemes can be more accurate, they also tend to be more time consuming. More detail on spatial differencing schemes may be found in [18, 52, 54]

# False Scattering

One of the more serious shortcomings of the discrete ordinates method is false scattering, which is a consequence of spatial discretization errors, and is akin to "numerical diffusion" in CFD calculations. If a single, collimated beam is traced through an enclosure by the discrete ordinates method, the beam will gradually widen as it moves farther away from its point of origin. This unphysical smearing of the radiative intensity, even in the absence of real scattering, is known as false scattering and can be reduced by using a finer mesh of control volumes.

# Ray Effect

Another serious drawback of the method is the so- called "ray effect," which is a consequence of angular discretization. Consider an enclosure with a very small zone (volume or surface area) with very high emission. Intensity from this zone will be carried away from it into the directions of the discrete ordinates. Far away from the emission zone these rays may become so far apart that some control volumes and/or surface zones may not receive any energy from this high- emission zone, leading to unphysical results. Clearly, the ray effect can be reduced by increasing the size of control volumes and surface zones. Therefore, when using a finer spatial mesh to reduce false scattering, this should be accompanied by an increase in the order of the method (i.e., a finer angular quadrature). More discussion on ray effects and how to mitigate them may be found in [55- 58].

Example 17.4. A gray, absorbing/emitting (but not scattering) medium is contained within a square enclosure of side lengths  $L$ . The medium is at radiative equilibrium and has a constant absorption coefficient such that  $\kappa L = 1$ . The top and both side walls are at zero temperature, while the bottom wall is isothermal at temperature  $T_{w}$  (with constant blackbody intensity  $I_{bw}$ ); all four surfaces are black. Calculate the local heat loss from the bottom surface using the discrete ordinates method.

# Solution

For the illustrative purposes of this example we shall limit ourselves to the simple nonsymmetric  $S_{2}$ - approximation, with the crude nodal system indicated in Fig. 17- 4. For the nonsymmetric  $S_{2}$ - approximation (without dependence in the  $z$ - direction) we have to consider four discrete ordinates whose direction vectors (projected into the  $x$ -  $y$ - plane) are  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i = \xi_i\hat{\mathbf{q}} + \eta_i\hat{\mathbf{j}} = \pm 0.5\hat{\mathbf{q}} \pm \hat{\mathbf{j}}$ ), as given by Table 17.1. The quadrature weight for each direction is, after doubling because of the two- dimensionality,  $w_{i} = \pi$ . For radiative equilibrium in a gray, nonscattering medium  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = 0$ , and the source function is, from equations (10.61) and (17.39),  $S = I_{b} = G / 4\pi$ , which is not a function of direction.

We will first solve the problem with the popular diamond spatial differencing scheme, i.e.,  $\gamma_{x} = \gamma_{y} = \frac{1}{2}$ . Since all nodal surface areas are  $A = L / 2$ , all  $|\xi_{i}| = |\eta_{i}| = 0.5$ , and  $\beta V = \kappa (L / 2)^{2} = 0.25\kappa L^{2} = 0.25L$ ,

FIGURE 17-4 Square enclosure for Example 17.4.

equation (17.48) becomes

$$
I_{pi} = \frac{\frac{1}{8}S_p + \frac{1}{4}I_{x,i} + \frac{1}{4}I_{y,i}}{\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_p + 2I_{x,i} + 2I_{y,i}\right).
$$

We start in the lower left corner with all directions for which  $\xi_{i} > 0$  and  $\eta_{i} > 0$  (i.e., a single direction for the  $S_{2}$ - approximation). For this direction  $x_{i} =$  West and  $y_{i} =$  South. To distinguish among the different nodes we attach the node number after the  $W$ , etc. For example,  $I_{W2,1}$  is the intensity at the West face of volume element 2, pointing into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{1}$ :

$i = 1$ $[\hat{\mathbf{s}}_1 = 0.5(\hat{\mathbf{1}} +\hat{\mathbf{1}})]:$  For all nodes

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}I_{pj,1} & = & \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{pj} + 2I_{Wj,1} + 2I_{Sj,1}\right),\\ & & I_{Ej,1} = 2I_{pj,1} - I_{Wj,1},\\ & & I_{Nj,1} = 2I_{pj,1} - I_{Sj,1},\quad j = 1,2,3,4. \end{array}
$$

Starting at Element 1 we have  $I_{W1,1} = 0$ ,  $I_{S1,1} = I_{bw}$ , and

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}I_{p1,1} & = & \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p1} + 2I_{bw}\right),\\ & & I_{E1,1} = 2I_{p1,1} = I_{W2,1},I_{N1,1} = 2I_{p1,1} - I_{bw} = I_{S3,1};\\ & & I_{p2,1} = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p2} + 2I_{W2,1} + 2I_{S2,1}\right) = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p2} + 4I_{p1,1} + 2I_{bw}\right),\\ & & I_{N2,1} = 2I_{p2,1} - I_{bw} = I_{S4,1};\\ & & I_{p3,1} = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p3} + 2I_{S3,1}\right) = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p3} + 4I_{p1,1} - 2I_{bw}\right),\\ & & I_{E3,1} = 2I_{p3,1} = I_{W4,1};\\ & & I_{p4,1} = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p4} + 2I_{W4,1} + 2I_{S4,1}\right)\\ & & = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p4} + 4I_{p3,1} + 4I_{p2,1} - 2I_{bw}\right). \end{array}
$$

$i = 2$ $[\hat{\mathbf{s}}_2 = 0.5(- \hat{\mathbf{1}} +\hat{\mathbf{1}})]:$  In a problem without symmetry we would start in the lower right corner, scanning again over all elements. However, in this problem we can determine the intensities right away through symmetry, as

$$
I_{p1,2} = I_{p2,1},I_{p2,2} = I_{p1,1},I_{p3,2} = I_{p4,1},I_{p4,2} = I_{p3,1}.
$$

$i = 3$ $[\hat{\mathbf{s}}_3 = - 0.5(\hat{\mathbf{1}} +\hat{\mathbf{y}})]:$  Starting in the upper right corner, we have, for all nodes,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{I_{p j,3} = \frac{1}{5}\Big(S_{p j} + 2I_{E j,3} + 2I_{N j,3}\Big),}\\ {I_{W j,3} = 2I_{p j,3} - I_{W E,3},}\\ {I_{S j,3} = 2I_{p j,3} - I_{N j,3}.} \end{array}
$$

Starting at Element 4 with  $I_{E4,3} = I_{N4,3} = 0,$  we find

$$
\begin{array}{c}{I_{p4,3} = \frac{1}{5} S_{p4},}\\ {I_{s4,3} = 2I_{p4,3} = I_{N2,3},I_{W4,3} = 2I_{p4,3} = I_{E3,3};} \end{array}
$$

$$
I_{p3,3} = \textstyle \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p3} + 2I_{E3,3}\right) = \textstyle \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p3} + 4I_{p4,3}\right),
$$

$$
I_{S3,3} = 2I_{p3,3} = I_{N1,3};
$$

$$
I_{p2,3} = \textstyle \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p2} + 2I_{N2,3}\right) = \textstyle \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p2} + 4I_{p4,3}\right),
$$

$$
I_{W2,3} = 2I_{p2,3} = I_{E1,3};
$$

$$
\begin{array}{r}I_{p1,3} = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p1} + 2I_{E1,3} + 2I_{N1,3}\right) = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p1} + 4I_{p2,3} + 4I_{p3,3}\right). \end{array}
$$

Also

$$
\begin{array}{r}I_{S1,3} = 2I_{p1,3} - I_{N1,3} = 2(I_{p1,3} - I_{p3,3}),\\ I_{S2,3} = 2I_{p2,3} - I_{N2,3} = 2(I_{p2,3} - I_{p4,3}), \end{array}
$$

which will be needed later for the calculation of wall heat fluxes from equation (17.8).  $i = 4$ $[\hat{\mathbf{s}}_4 = 0.5(\hat{\mathbf{1}} - \hat{\mathbf{y}})]:$  Again, by symmetry it follows immediately that

$$
I_{p1,4} = I_{p2,3},I_{p2,4} = I_{p1,3},I_{p3,4} = I_{p4,3},I_{p4,4} = I_{p3,3},
$$

and also

$$
I_{S1,4} = I_{S2,3},I_{S2,4} = I_{S1,3}.
$$

Summarizing, we have

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{I_{p1,1}} & {= I_{p2,2} = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p1} + 2I_{b w}\right),}\\ {I_{p2,1}} & {= I_{p1,2} = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p2} + 4I_{p1,1} + 2I_{b w}\right),}\\ {I_{p3,1}} & {= I_{p4,2} = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p3} + 4I_{p1,1} - 2I_{b w}\right),}\\ {I_{p4,1}} & {= I_{p3,2} = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p4} + 4I_{p3,1} + 4I_{p2,1} - 2I_{b w}\right),}\\ {I_{p4,3}} & {= I_{p2,4} = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p1} + 4I_{p2,3} + 4I_{p3,3}\right),}\\ {I_{p2,3}} & {= I_{p1,4} = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p2} + 4I_{p4,3}\right),}\\ {I_{p3,3}} & {= I_{p4,4} = \frac{1}{5}\left(S_{p3} + 4I_{p4,3}\right),}\\ {I_{p4,3}} & {= I_{p3,4} = \frac{1}{5} S_{p4},}\\ {I_{S1,3}} & {= I_{S2,4} = 2(I_{p1,3} - I_{p3,3}),}\\ {I_{S2,3}} & {= I_{S1,4} = 2(I_{p2,3} - I_{p4,3}).} \end{array}
$$

The source functions are readily evaluated from equation (17.7) and symmetry as

$$
\begin{array}{r}S_{p1} = S_{p2} = \frac{1}{4} (I_{p1,1} + I_{p1,2} + I_{p1,3} + I_{p1,4}),\\ S_{p3} = S_{p4} = \frac{1}{4} (I_{p3,1} + I_{p3,2} + I_{p3,3} + I_{p3,4}). \end{array}
$$

Since the equations are linear, one could substitute the relations for the  $S_{pj}$  into the above equations and solve for the unknown  $I_{pj}$ , by matrix inversion. However, in general one would have many more, and much more complicated, equations, which are best solved by iteration. We start by setting all  $S_{pj} = 0$ ,

finding values for the  $I_{pji}$ , updating the  $S_{pj}$ , reevaluating the  $I_{pji}$ , and so on, until convergence has been reached. The changing values of the intensity (normalized with  $I_{bw}$ ) as a function of iteration are given in Table 17.4. Values accurate to  $\simeq 5\%$  are reached after three iterations, and fully converged values (to four significant digits) are obtained after nine iterations. The converged intensities are used to determine the net radiative heat flux from the bottom wall at  $x = L / 4$  and  $x = 3L / 4$ . From equation (17.8) we have

$$
q(x = 0.25L) = q(x = 0.75L) = \pi I_{bw} - \sum_{i = 3}^{4}w_{i}I_{s1,i}|\eta_{i}| = \pi I_{bw} - \frac{\pi}{2} (I_{s1,3} + I_{s1,4}),
$$

or

$$
\Psi = \frac{q_{0.25L}}{E_{bw}} = \frac{q_{0.75L}}{E_{bw}} = 1 - \frac{I_{p1,3} - I_{p3,3} + I_{p2,3} - I_{p4,3}}{I_{bw}} = 0.7704.
$$

For comparison we will work this example also with the simpler, but more stable step differencing scheme, i.e.,  $\gamma_{x} = \gamma_{y} = 1$ . Then we obtain from equations (17.47) and (17.48)

$$
I_{pi} = \frac{1}{3} (S_{p} + I_{x,i} + I_{y,i}),\qquad I_{x,i} = I_{y,i} = I_{pi}.
$$

Then, following the same procedure we obtain (a little more easily)

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & I_{p1,1} = \frac{1}{3} (S_{p1} + 0 + I_{bw}) = I_{p2,2}\\ & I_{p2,1} = \frac{1}{3} (S_{p2} + I_{p1,1} + I_{bw}) = I_{p1,2}\\ & I_{p3,1} = \frac{1}{3} (S_{p3} + 0 + I_{p1,1}) = I_{p4,2}\\ & I_{p4,1} = \frac{1}{3} (S_{p4} + I_{p3,1} + I_{p2,1}) = I_{p3,2}\\ & I_{p4,3} = \frac{1}{3} (S_{p4} + 0 + 0) = I_{p3,4}\\ & I_{p3,3} = \frac{1}{3} (S_{p3} + I_{p4,3} + 0) = I_{p4,4}\\ & I_{p2,3} = \frac{1}{3} (S_{p2} + 0 + I_{p4,3}) = I_{p1,4}\\ & I_{p1,3} = \frac{1}{3} (S_{p1} + I_{p2,3} + I_{p3,3}) = I_{p2,4} \end{array}
$$

The formulas for the source functions and heat fluxes remain the same, but the nondimensional flux becomes, after substituting for  $I_{S} = I_{p}$ ,

$$
\Psi = 1 - \frac{I_{p1,3} + I_{p1,4}}{2I_{bw}} = 0.844.
$$

The iteration results for the step scheme are also included in Table 17.4. Results for the nondimensional heat flux from both schemes are shown in Fig. 17- 5 along with exact results reported by Razzaque and coworkers [59], and with  $S_{2}$ - and  $S_{4}$ - calculations of Truelove [15] (for a much finer mesh). Truelove's results demonstrate the importance of good ordinate sets, at least for low- order approximations: The  $S_{2}^{\prime}$  and  $S_{4}^{\prime}$  results were obtained with sets that do not obey the half- moment condition of equation (17.13) (as used by Fiveland [11] in a first investigation of rectangular enclosures), while the  $S_{2}$  and  $S_{4}$  results were

![](images/e9c8d79603929e16494d0bfb9a7504cde9f79a60f356464af18b1b5c97b94561.jpg)

obtained with the sets given in Table 17.1 (using the nonsymmetric ordinates for  $S_{2}$ ). Not surprisingly, the diamond scheme (similar to a Crank- Nicolson finite differencing scheme) is more accurate than the step scheme (similar to fully implicit finite differencing). The step scheme shows a smoother distribution for the  $I_{p}$  and  $S_{p}$  and is always stable. The diamond scheme, on the other hand, gives nonphysical negative intensities for  $I_{p3,1}$  during the first few iterations, which were set to zero.

Ray effects, while present, are not apparent in this example because of the large cells used to allow for hand calculations. They become very noticeable when repeating this example with a fine mesh, as will be done in the context of the finite volume method, the subject of the next section (see Example 17.7).

In his early calculations Fiveland [11] applied the  $S_{2}$ ,  $S_{4}$ , and  $S_{3}$ - approximations to purely scattering rectangular media  $(\omega = 1)$ , and to isothermal, nonscattering media bounded by cold black walls. Truelove [15] repeated some of those results to demonstrate the importance of good ordinate sets, and gave some new results for radiative equilibrium in a square enclosure. Jamaluddin and Smith [50] applied the  $S_{4}$ - approximation to a rectangular, nonscattering enclosure with known temperature profile. Kim and Lee investigated the effects of strongly anisotropic scattering, using high- order approximations (up to  $S_{16}$ ) [60], and the effects of collimated irradiation [61]. Finally, combined conduction and radiation in a linear- anisotropically scattering rectangular enclosure has been studied by Baek and Kim [62]. They also investigated the influence of radiation in compressible, turbulent flow over a backward facing step, using the same method (gray constant properties, here without scattering) [63]. Finally, radiation in two- dimensional packed beds, together with conduction and convection, was studied by Lu and coworkers [36]. While they also assumed gray properties, they allowed them to vary locally; for scattering, they used the large diffuse sphere phase function, equation (12.85). Other applications of the two- dimensional Cartesian form of the discrete ordinates method can be found in [64- 67], all dealing with combined- mode heat transfer. Particularly noteworthy here is the study of Selçuk and Kayakol [68], who compared the performance of the  $S_{4}$  method with that of the related discrete transfer method [69] (see p. 575), finding the methods to have comparable accuracy, while the  $S_{4}$  solution required three orders of magnitude less computer time.

# Three-Dimensional Problems

The method can be extended immediately to three- dimensional geometries by giving the control volume Front and Back surfaces,  $A_{F}$  and  $A_{B}$ , and rewriting equation (17.48) as

$$
I_{pi} = \frac{\beta VS_{pi} + |\xi_i|A_xI_{xii} / \gamma_x + |\eta_i|A_yI_{yii} / \gamma_y + |\mu_i|A_zI_{zii} / \gamma_z}{\beta V + |\xi_i|A_{x_e} / \gamma_x + |\eta_i|A_{y_e} / \gamma_y + |\mu_i|A_{z_e} / \gamma_z}, \tag{17.57}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{r}A_{x} = (1 - \gamma_{x})A_{x_{e}} + \gamma_{x}A_{x_{i}},\\ A_{y} = (1 - \gamma_{y})A_{y_{e}} + \gamma_{y}A_{y_{i}},\\ A_{z} = (1 - \gamma_{z})A_{z_{e}} + \gamma_{z}A_{z_{i}}, \end{array} \tag{17.58a}
$$

and the sub- subscript  $i$  again denotes the face where the beam enters, and  $e$  where it exits, as explained in the context of equation (17.48). A three- dimensional Cartesian enclosure has eight corners, from each of which  $\frac{1}{8} N(N + 2)$  directions must be traced (covering one octant of directions), for a total of  $N(N + 2)$  ordinates. Some such calculations have been performed by Jamaluddin and Smith [70] (nonscattering medium with prescribed temperature), and by Fiveland [13] and Truelove [16] (both studying the idealized furnace of Mengüç and Viskanta [71], considering a linear- anisotropically scattering medium with internal heat generation at radiative equilibrium), by Park and Yoon [72] (combined conduction and radiation, using inverse analysis to determine constant, gray values for  $\kappa$  and  $\sigma_{s}$ , for given temperature profiles), and Lacroix and colleagues (radiation in a plasma formed by the laser welding process) [73], and others. Also, Gonçalves and Coelho [74] have shown how the discrete ordinates method can be implemented on parallel computers. Fiveland and Jessee [75] discussed several acceleration schemes for optically thick geometries, for which the discrete ordinate method is known to converge very slowly (or not at all). An extensive review up to the year 2000 of the discrete ordinate method from a computer science point of view, emphasizing convergence rates and multigrid and parallel implementations, has been given by Balsara [76].

# Multidimensional Non-Cartesian Geometries

A few investigations have dealt with the application of the discrete ordinates method to two- and three- dimensional cylindrical enclosures, and more recently the method has also been applied to irregular geometries. A two- dimensional axisymmetric enclosure was first considered by Fiveland [10], who calculated radiative heat flux rates for a cylindrical furnace with known temperature profile. A very similar problem was treated by Jamaluddin and Smith [70] who, a little later, also addressed the case of a three- dimensional cylindrical furnace [77, 78]. Kim and Baek [79] investigated fully developed nonaxisymmetric pipe flow with a gray, constant property, absorbing/emitting and isotropically scattering medium. Kaplan and coworkers [80] modeled an unsteady ethylene diffusion flame, treating soot and combustion gasses as gray and nonscattering, but with spatial variation. Ramamurthy and colleagues [81] investigated reacting, radiating flow in radiant tubes, using a more sophisticated model for the spectral behavior of the combustion gases, and a molten glass jet was studied by Song and coworkers [82]. All of these used the  $S_{4}$ - method in two- dimensional, cylindrical geometries, although the  $S_{14}$ - scheme was used by Jendoubi et al. [83] to evaluate different scattering behaviors.

Complex three- dimensional geometries are difficult to treat with the standard discrete ordinates method. This was attempted by Howell and Beckner [84], who used "embedded boundaries" to simulate irregular surfaces, and by Adams and Smith [85], who modeled a complex furnace. Their results clearly demonstrate the ray effect: using a coarse ordinate mesh (up to  $S_{8}$ ) together with a very fine spatial mesh, their calculated radiative fluxes undergo very strong unphysical oscillations. Sakami and colleagues [86, 87] showed how spatial differentiation can be done across unstructured, triangular, two- dimensional meshes. They trace back each ray through each cell, integrating over the entire cell using a finite- element Galerkin scheme. A somewhat similar approach was suggested by Cheong and Song [88- 91]. Through careful spatial differencing, they showed how the standard discrete ordinates method can be applied to unstructured grids and irregular geometries. This method was also further refined by Seo and Kim [92].

Discretization of equation (17.4) for, both, rectangular Cartesian and irregular structured or unstructured grids may also be carried out using the finite volume approach of Patankar [93],

![](images/4afc17d69bb7eff51a938229b8d9b154e9ef71e95e117ca7fc4be2d4be275737.jpg)  
FIGURE 17-6 Spatial and directional discretization in a two-dimensional domain: (a) finite volume elements with nodes at the centers of the elements, (b) typical subdivision of all directions into solid angle elements.

as is done in the "finite volume method" (for radiation) described in the following section. This can then be combined with any spatial differencing scheme [18]. Alternatively, equation (17.4) can be solved using the finite element approach (e.g., [94, 95]), meshless methods (e.g., [96]), etc.

# 17.6 THE FINITE VOLUME METHOD

The discrete ordinates method, in its standard form, suffers from a number of serious drawbacks, such as false scattering and ray effects. The fact that half- range moments, equation (17.13), must be satisfied for the accurate evaluation of surface fluxes makes it very difficult to apply the method to irregular geometries. Perhaps the most serious drawback of the method is that it does not ensure conservation of radiative energy. This is a result of the fact that the standard discrete ordinates method uses simple quadrature for angular discretization, even though generally a finite volume approach is used for spatial discretization, as outlined in the previous sections. Thus, it was a logical step in the evolution of the method to move to a fully finite volume approach, in space as well as in direction. This was first proposed by Briggs and colleagues [97] in the field of neutron transport. The first formulations for radiative heat transfer were given by Raithby and coworkers [98- 101]. Slightly different schemes have been proposed by Chai and colleagues [102- 104]. A good review has been given by Raithby [105].

The finite volume method uses exact integration to evaluate solid angle integrals, which is analogous to the evaluation of areas and volumes in the finite volume approach. The method is fully conservative: exact satisfaction of all full- and half- moments can be achieved for arbitrary geometries, and there is no loss of radiative energy. The angular grid can be adapted to each special situation, such as collimated irradiation [102].

# Two-Dimensional Formulation

As in the development of the standard discrete ordinates method, for clarity we will limit our development to two- dimensional geometries; extension to three dimensions is straightforward. However, in view of the finite volume method's ability to easily accommodate irregular geometries, we will consider a general two- dimensional domain with irregularly- shaped finite volumes as depicted in Fig. 17- 6a. The quadrilateral volumes follow "practice B" of Patankar [93], the ones used by Chai and coworkers [104] (i.e., nodes are placed at the center of each finite volume). However, other finite volume schemes may be used, as well. Similar to the spatial domain, the

directional domain of  $4\pi$  steradians is broken up into  $n$  solid angles  $\Omega_{i}(i = 1,2,\ldots ,n)$ , which exactly fill the directional domain without overlap. This can be done in many ways, and without restrictions, but it is usually easiest to define the  $\Omega_{i}$  as the areas on a unit sphere defined by lines of longitude and latitude, as shown in Fig. 17- 6b.

The starting point for the analysis is again equation (17.1) together with its boundary condition, equation (17.2). For each volume element, such as the one surrounding point  $P$  in Fig. 17- 6a, equation (17.1) is integrated over the volume element and over each of the solid angle elements  $\Omega_{i}$ . The volume integration over  $\partial I / \partial s$  is the same as in equation (17.41), but is now for an element of arbitrary shape, for which we obtain

$$
\int_{V}\frac{\partial I}{\partial s} dV = \int_{V}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla I dV = \int_{V}\nabla \cdot (\hat{\mathbf{s}} I)dV = \int_{\Gamma}I\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} d\Gamma , \tag{17.59}
$$

where  $\Gamma$  is the surface of the volume element consisting of four (two- dimensional) or six (three- dimensional) faces and  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$  is the outward surface normal as indicated in the figure. In equation (17.59) the unit direction vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  can be moved inside the spatial  $\nabla$ - operator since directional coordinates are independent from spatial coordinates. Conversion to a surface integral in the last step follows from the divergence theorem [106].

Thus, integrating equation (17.1) over the volume element  $V$  and solid angle  $\Omega_{i}$  leads to

$$
\int_{\Omega_i}\int_\Gamma I\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} d\Gamma d\Omega = \int_{\Omega_i}\int_\Gamma (\kappa I_b - \beta I)dVd\Omega +\int_{\Omega_i}\int_V\frac{\sigma_s}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}} ',\hat{\mathbf{s}})J(\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')d\Omega 'dVd\Omega . \tag{17.60}
$$

In the simplest implementation of the finite volume method it is assumed, for the term on the left- hand side, that the intensity is constant across each face of the element as well as over the solid angle  $\Omega_{i}$ . Similarly, it is assumed for the volume integrals that values are constant throughout and equal to the value at point  $P$ . Equation (17.60) then becomes

$$
\sum_{k}I_{ki}(b_{i}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{k})A_{k} = \beta_{p}(S_{pi} - I_{pi})V\Omega_{i}, \tag{17.61a}
$$

$$
S_{pi} = (1 - \omega_p)I_{bp} + \frac{\omega_p}{4\pi}\sum_{j = 1}^{n}I_{pj}\bar{\Phi}_{ij}, \tag{17.61b}
$$

$$
\bar{\Phi}_{ij} = \frac{1}{\Omega_i}\int_{\Omega_i}\int_{\Omega_j}\bar{\Phi} (\hat{\mathbf{s}} ',\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega 'd\Omega , \tag{17.61c}
$$

$$
\mathbf{s}_i = \int_{\Omega_i}\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega , \tag{17.61d}
$$

where subscripts  $k$  and  $p$  imply evaluation at the center of the volume's faces  $A_{k}$  (as indicated by an  $\times$  in Fig. 17- 6a) and element center  $P$ , respectively; subscript  $i$  denotes a value associated with solid angle  $\Omega_{i}$ . The radiative source  $S_{pi}$  is similar to the one in equation (17.39), but now has an analytically averaged phase function  $\bar{\Phi}_{ij}$ . Finally, the  $\mathbf{s}_i$  is a vector (of varying length indicative of the size of  $\Omega_{i}$ ) pointing into an average direction within solid angle element  $\Omega_{i}$ . Of course, the forward- scattering term in  $S_{pi}$  can, and should, be removed as was done in the standard discrete ordinate formulation [cf. equation (17.50)].

What remains to be done is to relate the intensities at the face centers,  $I_{ki}$ , to those at volume centers,  $I_{pi}$ . There are many different ways to do this. Raithby and coworkers [98], in particular, have developed schemes of high accuracy. However, such sophisticated schemes require substantial analytical and computational overhead. In light of the stability considerations discussed by Chai and colleagues [48], the simple step scheme has generally been preferred. Therefore, similar to equation (17.43) with  $\gamma = 1$ , we assume that for intensities leaving control volume  $P$  (i.e., for  $\mathbf{s}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_k > 0$ )  $I_{ki} = I_{pi}$ . All incoming intensities  $(\mathbf{s}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_k< 0)$  are assigned the value of the

element center from which they came. Substituting  $I_{ki} = I_{pi}$  for  $\mathbf{s}_i \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_k > 0$  into equation (17.61) then leads to the final expression

$$
I_{pi} = \frac{\beta_pS_{pi}V\Omega_i + \sum_{k,\mathrm{in}}I_{ki}|\mathbf{s}_i\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}_k|A_k}{\beta_pV\Omega_i + \sum_{k,\mathrm{out}}(\mathbf{s}_i\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}_k)A_k}, \tag{17.62}
$$

where the "in" and "out" on the summation signs denote summation over volume faces with incoming  $(\mathbf{s}_i \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_k < 0)$  or outgoing  $(\mathbf{s}_i \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_k > 0)$  intensities, only. Lately, the CLAM scheme has become popular (e.g., [58, 107]), requiring an iterative approach as discussed in Section 17.5.

The boundary conditions are developed in a similar manner, except that—for diffusely emitting and reflecting surfaces—it is advantageous to make an energy balance to ensure conservation of radiative energy for surfaces not lined up with the solid angles  $\Omega_i$ . Multiplying equation (17.2) by  $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}$  and integrating over all outgoing directions gives an expression for surface radiosity as

$$
J_{w} = \int \limits_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} >0}I\hat{\mathbf{h}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = \int \limits_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} >0}\epsilon_{w}I_{bw}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega +(1 - \epsilon_{w})\int \limits_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} < 0}I|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} |d\Omega . \tag{17.63}
$$

In finite volume form, integrating over a surface element such as  $A_{Q}$  shown in Fig. 17- 6a, and making the standard assumption of constant intensities across  $A_{Q}$  leads to

$$
I_{q0}\sum_{i,\mathrm{out}}\mathbf{s}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_qA_Q = \epsilon_qI_{bq}\sum_{i,\mathrm{out}}\mathbf{s}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_qA_Q + (1 - \epsilon_q)\sum_{i,\mathrm{in}}I_{qq}\left|\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_q\right|A_Q \tag{17.64}
$$

or

$$
I_{q0} = \epsilon_qI_{bq} + (1 - \epsilon_q)\sum_{i,\mathrm{in}}I_{qi}\left|\mathbf{s}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_q\right|\bigg / \sum_{i,\mathrm{out}}\left(\mathbf{s}_i\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_q\right), \tag{17.65}
$$

where  $I_{q0}$  is the diffuse intensity leaving boundary element  $Q$  (same for all outgoing directions  $\Omega_i$  with  $\mathbf{s}_i \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_k > 0$ ),  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}_q$  is the unit surface normal at  $Q$  pointing out of the boundary (but into the adjacent volume element  $R$ ). The  $I_{qi}$  are intensities leaving the adjacent volume element  $R$  going into boundary element  $Q$ . Using the step scheme we can set  $I_{qi} = I_{Ri}$  for  $\mathbf{s}_i \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_q < 0$ .

Once all internal intensities  $I_{pi}$  and boundary intensities  $I_{qi}$  have been determined, internal values for incident radiation and radiative flux are found from

$$
G_{p} = \sum_{i}I_{pi}\Omega_{i},\qquad \mathbf{q}_{p} = \sum_{i}I_{pi}\mathbf{s}_{i}, \tag{17.66}
$$

while wall fluxes are given by

$$
q_{q} = \epsilon_{q}\left(E_{bq} - H_{q}\right) = \epsilon_{q}\left(I_{bq}\sum_{i,\mathrm{out}}\mathbf{s}_{i}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{q} - \sum_{i,\mathrm{in}}I_{qi}\left|\mathbf{s}_{i}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{q}\right|\right). \tag{17.67}
$$

Note that, for arbitrarily oriented surfaces, the sums of  $\left| \mathbf{s}_i \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_q \right|$  may not add up to  $\pi$  (for either incoming or outgoing directions); therefore, for consistency, the finite volume rendition for  $E_{bq}$  given in the right- most part of equation (17.67) is preferred.

Example 17.5. Repeat Example 17.1 for the finite volume method, using the upper and lower hemispheres as solid angle ranges.

# Solution

The governing equation is, as before,

$$
\mu \frac{dI}{d\tau} +I = (1 - \omega)I_b + \frac{\omega}{4\pi} (G + A_1q\mu).
$$

If we want to apply the finite volume method in a similar fashion as in Example 17.1, i.e., to obtain a differential equation for each solid angle range, then we need only integrate the governing equation

over these solid angles, not over volume. Assuming a constant intensity  $I^{+}$  over the upper hemisphere, and  $I^{- }$  over the lower one, we obtain with  $I_{b} = G / 4\pi$

$$
\begin{array}{l}\mathrm{upper~hemisphere:}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^1\left[\mu \frac{dI^+}{d\tau} +I^+ = \frac{1}{4\pi} (G + A_1\omega \mu q)\right]d\mu d\psi ,\\ \mathrm{lower~hemisphere:}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{-1}^0\left[\mu \frac{dI^-}{d\tau} +I^- = \frac{1}{4\pi} (G + A_1\omega \mu q)\right]d\mu d\psi , \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{c}\pi \frac{dI^{+}}{d\tau} +2\pi I^{+} = \frac{1}{2} G + \frac{1}{4} A_{1}\omega q,\\ -\pi \frac{dI^{-}}{d\tau} +2\pi I^{-} = \frac{1}{2} G - \frac{1}{4} A_{1}\omega q. \end{array}
$$

From the definitions for heat flux and incident radiation we have again

$$
\left\{ \begin{array}{l}G\\ q \end{array} \right\} = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{-1}^{+1}\left\{1\atop \mu \right\} Id\mu d\psi = \left\{ \begin{array}{l}2\pi (I^+ +I^-)\\ \pi (I^+ -I^-) \end{array} \right\} ,
$$

as in Example 17.1. Thus adding and subtracting the equations for the upper and lower hemispheres we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{lcl}\frac{dq}{d\tau} +G = G & \mathrm{or} & \frac{dq}{d\tau} = 0,\\ \displaystyle \frac{1}{2}\frac{dG}{d\tau} +2q = \frac{1}{2} A_1\omega q & \mathrm{or} & \frac{dG}{d\tau} = -(4 - A_1\omega)q. \end{array}
$$

For the boundary conditions, equation (17.65), we need to first calculate the  $\mathbf{s}_i$ :

$$
\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{s}_1 = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi /2}(\sin \theta \cos \psi \hat{\mathbf{r}} +\sin \theta \sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{r}} +\cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{k}})\sin \theta d\theta d\psi = \pi \hat{\mathbf{k}},\\ \displaystyle \mathbf{s}_2 = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{\pi /2}^{\pi}(\sin \theta \cos \psi \hat{\mathbf{r}} +\sin \theta \sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{r}} +\cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{k}})\sin \theta d\theta d\psi = -\pi \hat{\mathbf{k}}. \end{array}
$$

For the bottom boundary we have  $\hat{\mathbf{n}} = \hat{\mathbf{k}}$  and  $\mathbf{s}_1\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = - \mathbf{s}_2\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \pi$ , so that at

$$
\tau = 0:\qquad I^{+} = \epsilon_{1}I_{b1} + (1 - \epsilon_{1})I^{-}.
$$

Subtracting  $(1 - \epsilon_{1})I^{+}$ , using the definition for  $q$ , and dividing by  $\epsilon_{1}$  leads to

$$
\tau = 0:\qquad I^{+} = J_{1} / \pi = I_{b1} - \frac{1 - \epsilon_{1}}{\epsilon_{1}\pi} q,
$$

which is, of course, the same as for Example 17.1 (and for any diffuse surface). Similarly, at the top wall

$$
\tau = \tau_{i}:\qquad I^{-} = J_{2} / \pi .
$$

The solution is then found immediately from Example (17.1) (setting  $1 / \mu_{1}^{2} = 4$ ) as

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{J_1 - J_2} = \frac{1}{1 + \left(1 + \frac{A_1\omega}{4}\right)\tau_{i}},
$$

which is the same as the answer from the nonsymmetric  $S_{2}$ - approximation. More importantly, the analysis in this example shows that the Schuster- Schwarzschild (or two- flux) approximation is simply the lowest- level finite volume method.

Example 17.6. Repeat Example 17.4 using the finite volume method, by splitting the total solid angle into four equal ranges.

# Solution

As in Example 17.4 we will put the  $z$ - axis perpendicular to the paper in Fig. 17- 4, from which the polar angle  $\theta$  is measured. Because of the two- dimensionality, it is best to assign each  $\Omega_{i}$  the entire range of

polar angles, and a quarter of the azimuthal range. Thus, breaking up by quadrant we choose

$$
\begin{array}{lll}\Omega_1: & 0\leq \psi < \frac{\pi}{2}, & 0\leq \theta \leq \pi ,\\ \Omega_2: & \frac{\pi}{2}\leq \psi < \pi , & 0\leq \theta \leq \pi ,\\ \Omega_3: & \pi \leq \psi < \frac{3\pi}{2}, & 0\leq \theta \leq \pi ,\\ \Omega_4: & \frac{3\pi}{2}\leq \psi < 2\pi , & 0\leq \theta \leq \pi . \end{array}
$$

The solid angle vectors  $\mathbf{s}_i$  are obtained with  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \sin \theta \cos \psi \hat{\mathbf{1}} +\sin \theta \sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{j}} +\cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{k}}$  as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\mathbf{s}_i = \int_{{\Delta \psi}_i}^{\pi}\int_0^{\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\sin \theta d\theta d\psi = \int_{{\Delta \psi}_i}\left[\frac{\pi}{2}\cos \psi \hat{\mathbf{1}} +\frac{\pi}{2}\sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{j}} +0\hat{\mathbf{k}}\right]d\psi \\ = \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{1}} -\frac{\pi}{2}\cos \psi \hat{\mathbf{j}}\right)\bigg|_{{\Delta \psi}_i}, \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{s}_1 = \frac{\pi}{2} (\hat{\mathbf{1}} +\hat{\mathbf{j}}),\quad \mathbf{s}_2 = -\frac{\pi}{2} (\hat{\mathbf{1}} -\hat{\mathbf{j}}),\quad \mathbf{s}_3 = -\frac{\pi}{2} (\hat{\mathbf{1}} +\hat{\mathbf{j}}),\quad \mathbf{s}_4 = \frac{\pi}{2} (\hat{\mathbf{1}} -\hat{\mathbf{j}}),
$$

which are identical to the directions in Example 17.4, except for the factor  $\pi$  (which gives the total solid angle of the  $\Omega_{i}$ ), and the fact that the  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  in Example 17.4 were projections in the  $x - y$ - plane, while the  $\mathbf{s}_i$  in this example actually lie in the  $x - y$ - plane. Now, with  $A_{k} = \frac{1}{2} L$ ,  $\beta V = \kappa \left(\frac{1}{2} L\right)^{2} = \frac{1}{4} L$ , and  $\Omega_{i} = \pi$ , we obtain from equation (17.62)

$$
\Omega_{1}(i = 1):I_{p1} = \frac{\frac{1}{4}L\pi S_{p1} + I_{W1}|\mathbf{s}_{1}\cdot(-\hat{\mathbf{1}})|\frac{1}{2}L + I_{S1}|\mathbf{s}_{1}\cdot(-\hat{\mathbf{1}})|}{\frac{1}{4}L\pi + \mathbf{s}_{1}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{1}}\frac{1}{2}L + \mathbf{s}_{1}\cdot\hat{\mathbf{1}}\frac{1}{2}L},p = 1,2,3,4,
$$

and similarly for the other three directions. Evaluating the dot products and simplifying this may be written in general form for all nodes and all directions as

$$
I_{pi} = \frac{1}{3} (S_p + I_{px,i} + I_{py,i}),\quad p,i = 1,2,3,4,
$$

where  $I_{px,i}$  is the intensity entering volume  $p$  across the  $x =$  const face in the  $\mathbf{s}_i$  direction, and similarly for  $I_{py,i}$ . Thus

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I_{p1,1} = \frac{1}{3} (S_{p1} + I_{W1,1} + I_{S1,1}) = \frac{1}{3} (S_{p1} + 0 + I_{bW}),}\\ {I_{p2,1} = \frac{1}{3} (S_{p2} + I_{W2,1} + I_{S2,1}) = \frac{1}{3} (S_{p2} + I_{p1,1} + I_{bW}),}\\ {\ldots ,} \end{array}
$$

which is exactly the same as the  $S_{2}$ - approximation together with the step scheme. This is to be expected since  $(i)$  the finite volume method—as applied here—uses the step scheme, and  $(ii)$  the  $S_{2}$ - approximation satisfies all half- moments for this very simple case. The strength of the finite volume method lies in the fact that it is easily applied to irregular geometries, and that it conserves radiative energy. As in Example 17.4 ray effects are not obvious because of the coarse spatial mesh.

Appendix F includes program FVM2D. f, developed by Chai and colleagues [102- 104], which solves equations (17.62), (17.65) and (17.67) for arbitrary rectangular enclosures.

Example 17.7. Repeat Example 17.6 using program FVM2D. f to allow for fine grid and ordinate resolution. In particular, consider the case where only a part of the bottom strip,  $- 0.1 < x < +0.1$ , is heated.

# Solution

As in Example 17.4 we will put the  $z$ - axis perpendicular to the paper. We will use  $N \times N$  cells in the  $x$ -  $y$ - plane, and discretize the total solid angle into  $4 \times M$  subangles, limiting ourselves to 4 polar angles because of the two- dimensional nature of the problem. Results obtained by FVM2D. f for irradiation

upon the top surface, for an optically intermediate case of  $\tau_{L} = \kappa L = 1$ , are shown in Fig. 17- 7. The answers are compared with exact results from the Monte Carlo method (see Chapter 21), and also with those obtained from the  $P_{1}$  and  $P_{3}$ - approximations described in the previous chapter. Note that, for radiative equilibrium of a gray medium with isotropic scattering, the solution only depends on extinction coefficient (regardless of what fraction is scattered or absorbed/remitted), and the present example is identical to the case presented in Fig. 16- 11 (except for the partially heated strip considered here). Figure 17- 7a shows the effects of directional discretization for a fixed  $10\times 10$  spatial grid. It is observed that accuracy improves as we go from  $4\times 4$  to  $4\times 8$  directions, but deteriorates for much finer directional spacing. Ray effects are even more obvious in Fig. 17- 7b for a fixed directional discretization of  $4\times 8$ ; as the spatial grid becomes finer, more and more cells away from the heated wall receive no direct radiation along the chosen ordinates. Clearly, for a (relatively coarse)  $4\times 8$  directional discretization a (coarse)  $10\times 10$  spatial grid gives the most accurate answer, with rapidly diminishing accuracy for finer grids. Note that in the finite volume approach ray effects are less pronounced than in the standard discrete ordinates method (with its discrete directions as opposed to averaged solid angles), which is therefore expected to perform even worse for the present case.

In comparison, the  $P_{N}$  answers are relatively accurate, because they do not suffer from ray effects, and their answers are independent of spatial discretization (beyond a minimum  $N\times N$  discretization to avoid noticeable truncation errors). In this particular example,  $P_{1}$  actually outperforms  $P_{3}$ . This does not mean that the  $P_{N}$ - approximations are superior to the discrete ordinates approach, (or that  $P_{1}$  is better than  $P_{3}$ ), as seen from the additional results given in Fig. 16- 11 and the direct comparison between  $P_{N}$  and FVM given in [108] for this and several other problems.

Murthy and Mathur [109- 111] pointed out that, in general, equations (17.62), (17.65), and (17.67) incur errors due to solid angle overhang. For example, for face  $k$  of volume element  $P$  part of solid angle  $\Omega_{i}$  with  $\mathbf{s}_{i}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}_{k} > 0$  (pointing out of volume element) may actually overlap into the element. Similarly, it is unlikely to have solid angle boundaries lined up perfectly with the solid boundaries everywhere. They improved the accuracy of the method through pixelation, i.e., by breaking up  $\Omega_{i}$  into smaller pieces, to determine overlap fractions. Also, noting that the standard line iteration method leads to unacceptably slow convergence in optically thick situations, they introduced a new scheme, which updates all directional intensities within a cell simultaneously, leading to convergence rates essentially independent of optical thickness [111,112]. Hassanzadeh and coworkers [113] also developed a method to accelerate convergence for optically thick media by carrying out iterations in terms of mean intensity,  $G / 4\pi$ , as opposed to all directional intensities. Several other improvements to the method have been suggested. Kim and Huh [114] noted that most researchers broke up the total solid angle of  $4\pi$  into  $N\times N$

segments of equal polar angles  $\theta$  and azimuthal angles  $\psi$ . This makes the  $\Omega_{i}$  very small near the poles  $(\theta = 0, \pi)$ , and large near the equator  $(\theta = \pi /2)$ . They suggest that, for  $n$  different polar angles  $\theta_{i}$ , one should pick fewer azimuthal angles near the poles, namely a distribution of  $4, 8, \ldots , 2n - 4, 2n, 2n, 2n - 4, \ldots , 8, 4$  with growing  $\theta_{i}$ . This results in  $n(n + 2)$  different solid angles (equal to the number of ordinates in the standard  $S_{n}$  scheme), with all  $\Omega_{i}$  being roughly equally large. Finally, Liu and coworkers [115] have shown how the finite volume method with unstructured grids can be parallelized using domain decomposition. The method has also been employed in a number of combined heat transfer problems [116,117] and is included in several important commercial CFD codes, such as FLUENT [118].

# Comparison with Standard Discrete Ordinates Method

The radiative transfer equation (RTE), equation (17.1), is a five- dimensional integro- differential equation, with three spatial and two directional coordinates. For a numerical solution both, spatial and directional dependencies must be discretized. Various methods of discretization are available, such as finite differences, finite volumes, finite elements, etc., and one or the other may be applied for the spatial and for the directional discretization. Originally, for the standard discrete ordinates method, finite differences were used for both. As the method has evolved to more general geometries, different spatial discretization schemes have been employed, but directional discretization has remained in finite difference form. In contrast, in the original form of the finite volume method, finite volumes were used for both spatial and directional discretization. However, recently other spatial discretization schemes have also been used, e.g., Cui and Li [119] and Grissa et al. [120] employed the finite element method. Therefore, the one defining difference between the standard discrete ordinates method and the finite volume method is the fact that the standard discrete ordinates method uses finite differences for directional discretization, while the finite volume method employs finite volumes.

Liu and coworkers [121] have expressed the RTE in general boundary- fitted coordinates [122], and applied both the standard discrete ordinates method and the finite volume method to a number of two- and three- dimensional problems. They found both methods to require similar amounts of CPU time, while the finite volume method was always slightly more accurate. Similar conclusions were drawn by Fiveland and Jessee [123] and by Kim and Huh [124], noting that the finite volume (FV) method outperforms standard discrete ordinates particularly in optically thin media, since it is less sensitive to ray effects. Coelho and coworkers [125] compared the performance of the FV method with that of the discrete transfer method [69] and, like Selguk and Kayakol [68], found the FV method to be much more economical. Major advantages of the finite volume method are greater freedom to select ordinates, and the fact that the FV method conserves radiative energy. In addition, treatment of complex enclosures comes more natural to the FV method. For example, Baek and colleagues [126- 128] used boundary- fitted coordinates to investigate radiation in several three- dimensional enclosures with gray, constant- property media.

# 17.7 THE MODIFIED DISCRETE ORDINATES METHOD

It was noted in Section 17.5 that the discrete ordinates method (in its standard or finite volume form) can suffer from ray effects, if directional discretization is coarse compared to spatial discretization, and if the medium contains small sources of strong emission (from walls or from within the medium). This prompted Ramankutty and Crosbie [129, 130] to separate boundary emission from medium emission, as is done in the modified differential approximation of Section 16.8, i.e., letting

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_w(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + I_m(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}). \tag{17.68}
$$

The wall- related intensity field can be solved by any standard method as outlined in Section 17.5, while the RTE and boundary conditions for  $I_{m}$  become

$$
\frac{dI_m}{ds} = \kappa I_b - \beta I_m(\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + \frac{\sigma_s}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_m(\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}} ',\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega ' + \frac{\sigma_s}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_w(\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}} ',\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega ', \tag{17.69}
$$

$$
I_{m}(\mathbf{r}_{w},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \frac{1 - \epsilon}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}< 0}I_{m}\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}|d\Omega^{\prime}. \tag{17.70}
$$

Again, equations (17.69) and (17.70) are valid for a gray medium or, on a spectral basis, for a nongray medium, in an enclosure with opaque, diffusely emitting and diffusely reflecting walls. Comparing with equations (17.4) and (17.5) it is apparent that the modified equation for  $I_{m}$  can be solved in the same manner by replacing the emission term,  $\kappa I_{b}$ , in equation (17.4) by

$$
\kappa I_{b} + \frac{\sigma_{s}}{4\pi}\sum_{j = 1}^{n}w_{j}I_{w}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{j})\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{j},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i}).
$$

For a given temperature and radiative property field the wall- related intensity is calculated once and for all, and does not require reevaluation during the iterations required for  $I_{m}$  in the presence of scattering, wall reflections, or higher- order spatial schemes. Alternatively, equations (17.69) and (17.70) can also be solved with the finite volume method by adding the  $I_{w}$ - related scattering source to  $S_{ji}$  in equation (17.61b). Ramankutty and Crosbie applied the modified discrete ordinates method to boundary- emission dominated rectangular enclosures with black walls, using analytical solutions for  $I_{w}$ . For such problems, when using lower- order  $S_{N}$ - techniques with fine spatial meshes, the standard discrete ordinates method shows strong ray effects, which are completely mitigated by the modified discrete ordinates approach. Sakami and colleagues [131, 132] and Baek and coworkers [128, 133] investigated irregular geometries with this modified discrete ordinates method, the latter employing a straightforward Monte Carlo scheme for the wall emission part, giving excellent accuracy even with extreme boundary source terms.

However, like the modified differential approximation, the modified discrete ordinates method cannot improve the accuracy of the underlying standard method if strong, isolated emission sources are located within the medium. Coelho [56] and Li and Werther [134] extended the method by associating all emission (walls and medium) with  $I_{w}$ , and only scattered radiation is calculated by discrete ordinates. While this mitigates all ray effects, it is not clear what is gained by this approach (since solution for the emission- related intensity is essentially as involved as the full problem).

# 17.8 EVEN-PARITY FORMULATION

The directional RTEs that are solved for the standard discrete ordinates method, equation (17.4), or the finite volume method, equation (17.61), are first- order partial differential equations with hyperbolic character, which can lead to unphysical results (negative intensities) and may display strong ray effects. Converting them into second- order boundary value problems eliminates unphysical results and could potentially mitigate ray effects. In the heat transfer field this was first attempted by Song and Park [135]. A second- order formulation may be obtained by defining even- and odd- parity intensities, involving both forward  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  and backward  $- \hat{\mathbf{s}}$  directions along a line:

$$
\begin{array}{r}\psi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + I(\mathbf{r}, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}),\\ \phi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) - I(\mathbf{r}, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}). \end{array} \tag{17.71}
$$

In the following discussion we will limit ourselves to the simpler case of isotropic scattering. Under those conditions, adding and subtracting the RTE (17.1) for both directions  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  and  $- \hat{\mathbf{s}}$  leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla \phi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = -\beta (\mathbf{r})\psi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + 2\kappa (\mathbf{r})I_b(\mathbf{r}) + \frac{2\sigma_s(\mathbf{r})}{4\pi}\int_{2\pi}\psi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')d\Omega '\\ \hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla \psi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = -\beta (\mathbf{r})\phi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}). \end{array} \tag{17.74}
$$

Note that integration over all directions now encompasses only  $2\pi$  (half a unit sphere). Using equation (17.74) the odd- parity term is easily eliminated, leading to a parabolic, second- order partial differential equation,

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla \left(\frac{1}{\beta(\mathbf{r})}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla \psi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\right) = \beta (\mathbf{r})\psi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) - 2\kappa (\mathbf{r})I_b(\mathbf{r}) - \frac{2\sigma_s(\mathbf{r})}{4\pi}\int_{2\pi}\psi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')d\Omega ', \tag{17.75}
$$

which requires a boundary condition at each end (boundary intersection) of the dual- direction ray. Substituting equations (17.71) and (17.72) into (17.2) gives

$$
\psi (\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + \phi (\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = 2\epsilon (\mathbf{r}_w)I_b(\mathbf{r}_w) + \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}_w)}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '\cdot < 0}[\psi (\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ') - \phi (\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')]|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '|d\Omega ',\quad \hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} >0. \tag{17.76}
$$

Because of the dual- directional nature of  $\psi$  and  $\phi$ , the boundary condition must also be applied in the  $- \hat{\mathbf{s}}$ - direction, or

$$
\psi (\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) - \phi (\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = 2\epsilon (\mathbf{r}_w)I_b(\mathbf{r}_w) + \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}_w)}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '\cdot < 0}[\psi (\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ') + \phi (\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')]|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '|d\Omega ',\quad \hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} < 0. \tag{17.77}
$$

These two differ only with the sign of  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}$ ; they are readily combined and  $\phi$  is eliminated giving the proper boundary conditions at both ends of a ray described by equation (17.75) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\psi (\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) - \mathrm{sign}(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}})\frac{1}{\beta(\mathbf{r})}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla \psi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\\ \displaystyle = 2\epsilon (\mathbf{r}_w)I_b(\mathbf{r}_w) + \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}_w)}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '\cdot < 0}\left[\psi (\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ') + \mathrm{sign}(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}})\frac{1}{\beta(\mathbf{r})}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla \psi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')\right]|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '|d\Omega '. \end{array} \tag{17.78}
$$

In the even- parity formulation directional discretization is only over  $2\pi$  or a half- sphere, i.e., only half as many ordinates are required and, instead, second- order partial differential equations need to be solved. Spatial discretization may be done by central differences [135], by finite volumes [136,137], or by finite elements [94,123,138,139]; directional discretization has generally been done according to the standard discrete ordinates method, with the exception of Becker and coworkers [139], who employed finite elements also for directional discretization. Liu et al. [137], Fiveland and Jessee [123], and Kang and Song [138] compared the standard implementation of the discrete ordinates method to the even- parity formulation and found, in general, that the accuracy was similar, but the even- parity model required more CPU time, particularly in optically thin situations.

# 17.9 OTHER RELATED METHODS

The difficulty caused by the directional nature of radiation has prompted a number of researchers to develop various approximate schemes to discretize directions (similar to the standard discrete ordinates method) or to average over solid angle ranges (akin to the finite volume method). We will here briefly discuss the most important of these related models.

Flux Methods. We have already seen in Example 17.5 that the two- flux or Schuster- Schwarz- schild approximation is nothing but a crude implementation of the finite volume method. The

two- flux method has been applied to one- dimensional problems by a number of investigators, usually in situations where the accurate determination of radiative fluxes is not crucial [140- 145]. Noting that the accuracy of this method is more or less limited to one- dimensional problems without anisotropic scattering, Chin and Churchill [146, 147] developed the six- flow method, primarily to deal with strongly anisotropic scattering in the presence of collimated irradiation. In this method the intensity is broken up into a forward, a backward, and four (usually equal) sideways components. How these components are broken up or averaged over the total solid angle of  $4\pi$  is arbitrary. The method has been applied by various researchers to several two- and three- dimensional problems [147- 150].

Discrete Transfer Method. The discrete transfer method (DTM) was developed by Lockwood and Shah [69], several years before serious development of the discrete ordinates method (DOM) began. The discrete transfer method is similar to the discrete ordinates method inasmuch as discrete directions are chosen. It is also related to the Monte Carlo method (see Chapter 21), since rays of intensity are traced from surface to surface. In essence, nodal points are established on the enclosure's boundary, from which rays are sent out into predetermined directions. The ray is then traced as it traverses through internal finite volumes, and this interaction is recorded (weakening of the ray by depositing energy in the volume, strengthening by emission and inscattering), until it hits another surface. The method is very similar to the standard DOM and carries its disadvantages (nonconservative, susceptible to ray effects, needs iterations for nonblack walls and/or scattering), but uses much more cumbersome beam tracing (equivalent to the exponential scheme). A solid angle "pencil" is established at the emission point, causing inaccuracies as the beam passes through internal volumes. The ray tracing is very similar to that of the Monte Carlo method. While the DTM avoids the statistical scatter of the Monte Carlo method, it is less efficient because each ray carries a single piece of statistic (given location, direction, wavelength), while a statistically chosen bundle in a Monte Carlo simulation carries multiple statistics (particularly important in nongray, reflecting and/or scattering environments). Still, the method enjoys some popularity because of its early arrival, its early ability to deal with irregular geometries, and because it has been incorporated into several important commercial CFD codes. Cumber [151, 152] has offered several improvements for the method, Coelho and Carvalho [153] presented a conservative formulation of the DTM, and Versteeg and coworkers [154, 155] have quantified the errors inherent to the method. Two- and three- dimensional calculations have been performed by several researchers, mostly for furnace and other combustion applications [156- 163]. Several comparisons between the DTM and other methods have also been made. Selcuk and Kayakol [68] compared DTM and  $S_{4}$  solutions for two- dimensional, rectangular geometries and found that the  $S_{4}$  method gave results of comparable accuracy at three orders of magnitude less computer time. Similarly, Coelho and coworkers [125] solved the radiation problem in two- dimensional enclosures with obstacles, using DTM, DOM, FVM, Monte Carlo, and the zonal method (see Chapter 18); they found DOM and FVM to be the most economical. Finally, Keramida and colleagues employed the DTM and six- flux methods to model natural gas- fired furnaces [150], finding the six- flux method to be superior.

YIX Method. In this method, first developed by Tan and Howell [164], the radiative transfer equation is expressed in integral form [see, for example, equation (10.28)], i.e., incident radiation,  $G$ , and radiative flux,  $q$ , can be evaluated at any point (inside the medium, or on the boundaries) as a triple integral (in distance away from the point, and in solid angle). Integration away from each point (along discrete ordinates) involves certain geometric functions, which can be predetermined. While this method has the potential to be more efficient than the DOM and the FVM, setup work for each problem is significant and generalization is difficult. The method appears to have been used only by the group that developed it [165- 169].

# 17.10 CONCLUDING REMARKS

The finite volume method, because of its general applicability, and the ability to generate highaccuracy solutions with fine meshes, is today probably the most popular method to solve the RTE in complex situations. To be sure, the method also has its weaknesses: it always requires an iterative solution in the presence of scattering and/or reflecting walls, and for optically thick media these iterations tend to converge very slowly, if at all. In addition, the discrete ordinates method is prone to ray effects and can suffer from false scattering. However, the DOM and FVM are the only methods (aside from the statistical Monte Carlo method) that, through refinement of the spatial and directional grids, can be carried to arbitrary levels of accuracy without adding to its mathematical complexity.

The discrete ordinates method is related to the zonal method of Chapter 18, which was the preferred RTE solution method until the 1960s. The zonal method also performs poorly in optically thick media, but it does not suffer from ray effects and false scattering. However, it cannot be used in the presence of anisotropic scattering, and it is difficult to apply to irregular geometries. The  $P_{1}$  - approximation, on the other hand, is much easier to apply and solve, and gives very accurate results for optically thick media (where DOM and FVM are difficult to apply), as well as for hot, radiating media in cold surroundings. But this method fails in optically thin media surrounded by radiating walls and/or subject to directional irradiation. Importantly, higher orders of the  $P_N$  - approximation are mathematically difficult to formulate.

# Problems

17.1 Consider a gray, isothermal and isotropically scattering medium contained between large, isothermal, gray plates at temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , and emittances  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$ , respectively. Determine the radiative flux between the plates using the  $S_{2}$ - approximation.

17.2 Consider a large, isothermal (temperature  $T_{w}$ ), gray and diffuse (emittance  $\epsilon$ ) wall adjacent to a semi- infinite gray absorbing/emitting and linear- anisotropically scattering medium. The medium is isothermal (temperature  $T_{m}$ ). Determine the radiative flux as a function of distance away from the plate using the  $S_{2}$ - approximation.

17.3 Consider parallel, black plates, spaced  $1\mathrm{m}$  apart, at constant temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ . Due to pressure variations, the (gray) absorption coefficient is equal to

$$
\kappa = \kappa_{1} + \kappa_{1}x;\quad \kappa_{0} = 0.01\mathrm{cm}^{-1};\quad \kappa_{1} = 0.0002\mathrm{cm}^{-2},
$$

where  $x$  is measured from plate 1. The medium does not scatter radiation. Determine, for radiative equilibrium, the nondimensional heat flux  $\Psi = q / \sigma (T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4})$  by the exact method, and the  $S_{2}$ - approximation.

17.4 Black spherical particles of  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  radius are suspended between two cold and black parallel plates  $1\mathrm{m}$  apart. The particles produce heat at a rate of  $\pi /10\mathrm{W}/$  particle, which must be removed by thermal radiation. The number of particles between the plates is given by

$$
N_{T}(z) = N_{0} + \Delta Nz / L,\quad 0< z< L;\qquad N_{0} = \Delta N = 212\mathrm{~particles} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}.
$$

(a) Determine the local absorption coefficient and the local heat production rate; introduce an optical coordinate and determine the optical thickness of the entire gap.  
(b) If the  $S_{2}$ -approximation is to be employed, what are the relevant equations and boundary conditions governing the heat transfer?  
(c) What are the heat flux rates at the top and bottom surfaces? What is the entire amount of energy released by the particles? What is the maximum particle temperature?

17.5 Two infinitely long, concentric cylinders of radii  $R_{1}$  and  $R_{2}$  with emittances  $\epsilon_{1}$  and  $\epsilon_{2}$  have the same constant surface temperature  $T_{w}$ . The medium between the cylinders has a constant absorption coefficient  $\kappa$  and does not scatter; uniform heat generation  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}$  takes place inside the medium. Determine the temperature distribution in the medium and heat fluxes at the wall if radiation is the only means of heat transfer, using the  $S_{2}$ -approximation.

17.6 An infinite, black, isothermal plate bounds a semi- infinite space filled with black spheres. At any given distance  $z$  away from the plate the particle number density is identical, namely,  $N_{T} = 6.3662 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m}^{- 3}$ . However, the radius of the suspended spheres diminishes monotonically away from the surface as

$$
a = a_{o}e^{-z / L};\qquad a_{o} = 10^{-4}\mathrm{m},\qquad L = 1\mathrm{m}.
$$

(a) Determine the absorption coefficient as a function of  $z$  (you may make the large-particle assumption). 
(b) Determine the optical coordinate as a function of  $z$ . What is the total optical thickness of the semi-infinite space? 
(c) Assuming that radiative equilibrium prevails and using the  $S_{2}$ -approximation, set up the boundary conditions and solve for heat flux and temperature distribution (as a function of  $z$ ).

17.7 Consider two parallel black plates, both at  $1000 \mathrm{~K}$ , that are  $2 \mathrm{~m}$  apart. The medium between the plates emits and absorbs (but does not scatter) with an absorption coefficient of  $\kappa = 0.05236 \mathrm{~cm}^{- 1}$  (gray medium). Heat is generated by the medium according to the formula

$$
\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} = C\sigma T^{4},\qquad C = 6.958\times 10^{-4}\mathrm{cm}^{-1},
$$

where  $T$  is the local temperature of the medium between the plates. Assuming that radiation is the only important mode of heat transfer, determine the heat flux to the plates using the (symmetric)  $S_{2}$ - approximation.

17.8 A furnace burning pulverized coal may be approximated by a gray cylinder at radiative equilibrium with uniform heat generation  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} = 0.266 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ , bounded by a cold black wall. The gray and constant absorption and scattering coefficients are, respectively,  $0.16 \mathrm{~cm}^{- 1}$  and  $0.04 \mathrm{~cm}^{- 1}$ , while the furnace radius is  $R = 0.6 \mathrm{~m}$ . Scattering may be assumed to be isotropic. Using the  $S_{2}$ - approximation:

(a) Set up the relevant equations and their boundary conditions. 
(b) Calculate the total heat loss from the furnace (per unit length). 
(c) Calculate the radial temperature distribution; what are the centerline and the adjacent-to-wall temperatures? 
(d) Qualitatively, if the extinction coefficient is kept constant, what is the effect of varying the scattering coefficient on  $(i)$  heat transfer rates,  $(ii)$  temperature levels?

17.9 Estimate the radial temperature distribution in the sun. You may make the following assumptions:

(i) The sun is a sphere of radius  $R$  (ii) As a result of high temperatures in the sun, the absorption and scattering coefficients may be approximated to be constant, i.e.,  $\kappa_{\nu}, \beta_{\nu} = \mathrm{const} \neq f(\nu , T, r)$  (free-free transitions!). (iii) As a result of high temperatures, radiation is the only mode of heat transfer. (iv) The fusion process may be approximated by assuming that a small sphere at the center of the sun releases heat uniformly corresponding to the total heat loss of the sun (i.e., assume the sun to be concentric spheres with a certain flux at the inner boundary  $r = r_{i}$ ). (a) Relate the heat production to the effective sun temperature  $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 5777 \mathrm{~K}$ . (b) Would you expect the sun to be optically thin, intermediate, or thick? Why? What are the prevailing boundary conditions? (c) Find an expression for the temperature distribution (for  $r > r_{i}$ ) using the  $S_{2}$ -approximation. (d) What is the surface temperature of the sun?

17.10 Repeat Problem 17.9 but replace assumption  $(iv)$  by the following: The fusion process may be approximated by assuming that the sun releases heat uniformly throughout its volume corresponding to the total heat loss of the sun.

17.11 Consider a sphere of very hot dissociated gas of radius  $5\mathrm{cm}$ . The gas may be approximated as a gray, linear- anisotropically scattering medium with  $\kappa = 0.1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ,  $\sigma_{s} = 0.2\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ,  $A_{1} = 1$ . The gas is suspended magnetically in vacuum within a large cold container and is initially at a uniform temperature  $T_{g} = 10,000\mathrm{K}$ . Using the  $S_{2}$ - approximation and neglecting conduction and convection, specify the total heat loss per unit time from the entire sphere at time  $t = 0$ . Outline the solution procedure for times  $t > 0$ .Hint: Solve the governing equation by introducing a new dependent variable  $g(\tau) = \tau (4\pi I_b - G)$ .

17.12 Consider a gray, isothermal, isotropically- scattering medium contained between large, cold, black plates. Determine the local radiative heat flux using the  $S_{4}$ - method. To this purpose, set up the analytical solution using the method of successive approximations, i.e., guess a radiative source function,  $S(\tau)$ , which is to be improved by successive iterations. Carry out one successive approximation.

17.13 Reconsider Problem 17.12 for a similar medium at radiative equilibrium contained between isothermal black plates at temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , respectively.

17.14 A hot gray medium is contained between two concentric black spheres of radius  $R_{1} = 10\mathrm{cm}$  and  $R_{2} = 20\mathrm{cm}$ . The surfaces of the spheres are isothermal at  $T_{1} = 2000\mathrm{K}$  and  $T_{2} = 500\mathrm{K}$ , respectively. The medium absorbs, emits with  $n = 1$ ,  $\kappa = 0.05\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , but does not scatter radiation. Determine the heat flux between the spheres using the  $S_{4}$ - approximation. Compare your results with those of Table 14.2. Note: This problem requires the numerical solution of four simultaneous simple ordinary differential equations.

17.15 Repeat Problem 17.2 using the finite volume method. Use the upper and lower hemispheres as solid angle ranges.

17.16 Repeat Problem 17.10 using the finite volume method. Use the upper and lower hemispheres as solid angle ranges.

(a) Use the solid angle ranges of Example 17.6. 
(b) Alternatively, let the  $\mathcal{Z}$  -axis point from plate to plate (with polar angle  $\theta$  measured from it) and choose:

$$
\begin{array}{lll}\Omega_1: & 0\leq \psi < \frac{\pi}{2}, & 0\leq \theta \leq \pi ,\\ \displaystyle \Omega_2: & \frac{\pi}{2}\leq \psi < \pi , & 0\leq \theta \leq \pi ,\\ \displaystyle \Omega_3: & \pi \leq \psi < \frac{3\pi}{2}, & 0\leq \theta \leq \pi ,\\ \displaystyle \Omega_4: & \frac{3\pi}{2}\leq \psi < 2\pi , & 0\leq \theta \leq \pi . \end{array}

# CHAPTER 18

# THE ZONAL METHOD

# 18.1 INTRODUCTION

The zonal method for the determination of radiative heat transfer rates within an absorbing, emitting, and isotropically scattering medium is an extension of the net radiation method developed in Chapter 5 for surface exchange (i.e., for enclosures without a participating medium). In this method the enclosure is subdivided into a finite number of isothermal volume and surface area zones. An energy balance is then performed for the radiative exchange between any two zones, employing precalculated "exchange areas." This process leads to a set of simultaneous equations for the unknown temperatures or heat fluxes. The method was first developed by Hottel and Cohen [1] for an absorbing, emitting, nonscattering gray gas with constant absorption coefficient. Hottel and Sarofim [2] extended it to deal with nonconstant and nongray absorption coefficients as well as with isotropically scattering media. The discussion by Hottel and Sarofim [2] is extensive but is limited to three- dimensional problems (i.e., only volume zones finite in all three dimensions are discussed). The method was extended by Walther and coworkers [3] to allow for linear variation of emissive power through a one- dimensional slab zone and by Einstein to deal with two- dimensional zones in Cartesian [4] and cylindrical [5] coordinate systems. A slight variation of the method has been given by Larsen and Howell [6], who expressed the energy balances in terms of "exchange factors," which are physically measurable quantities. Such measurements were carried out by Liu and Howell [7]. Another derivative model is the  $\mathrm{REM}^2$  method by Maruyama [8- 10]. Yuen and Takara [11] (and Ma [12] for a one- dimensional slab) have shown that the zonal method can be applied to anisotropically scattering media, but only at a great increase in required computer time.

# 18.2 SURFACE EXCHANGE - NO PARTICIPATING MEDIUM

We shall start by rederiving the relations for radiative exchange between surfaces in the zonal form, since doing so clearly demonstrates the similarities between the standard net radiation method and the zonal method. As in the net radiation approach we break up the surface of the enclosure into  $N$  isothermal subsurfaces, or zones, as shown in Fig. 18- 1.

# Black Surfaces - Direct Exchange Areas

If the enclosure consists of only black surfaces then the net exchange of radiative energy between any two surfaces is, from equation (5.9),

$$
Q_{i\leftrightarrow j} = -Q_{j\leftrightarrow i} = \overline{s_i s_j} (E_{bi} - E_{bj}),\qquad i,j = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{18.1}
$$

![](images/36fd59319fbf70f176058a01ff083533f59e8651f8611a72918f444fa62b1bac.jpg)  
FIGURE 18-1 General enclosure broken into  $N$  isothermal surface zones.

where  $Q_{i\leftrightarrow j}$  is the net energy exchange between zones  $i$  and  $j$  (positive if zone  $i$  is losing heat as a result of the exchange) and the

$$
\overline{s_i s_j} = \overline{s_j s_i} = A_i F_{i\rightarrow j} = A_j F_{j\rightarrow i} = \int_{A_i}\int_{A_j}\frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{\pi s_{ij}^2} dA_j dA_i \tag{18.2}
$$

are known as direct exchange areas. Unlike the view factors,  $F_{i\rightarrow j}$ , the  $\overline{s_i s_j}$  are not nondimensional but have the dimensions of area. While this is a minor inconvenience the formulation of equation (18.2) has the advantage that the principle of reciprocity is more easily applied (eliminating a common source of error). Although the use of direct exchange factors (reducing to view factors in the absence of a participating medium) would be just as acceptable, the use of exchange areas is accepted practice. Summing equation (18.1) over all zones yields the net heat flux at zone  $i$  as

$$
Q_{i} = A_{i}q_{i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_{i}s_{j}} (E_{bi} - E_{bj}) = A_{i}E_{bi} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_{i}s_{j}} E_{bj},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{18.3}
$$

Since the total heat flux leaving surface  $i$  is  $A_{i}E_{bi}$ , we find that

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_i s_j} = A_i, \tag{18.4}
$$

which is equivalent to equation (4.18), or  $\sum_{j = 1}^{N}F_{i\rightarrow j} = 1$

# Gray Diffuse Surfaces - Total Exchange Areas

If the surfaces are not black but are partially reflective, then the energy exchange between zones is not only by direct travel, but also may include contributions due to single and multiple reflections from any number of surface zones. If the reflective behavior of the surfaces is gray and diffuse, then the reflected radiation leaving a surface cannot be distinguished from emitted radiation and equation (18.1) still holds after replacing emissive power  $E_{b}$  by radiosity  $J$  (as described in detail in Chapter 5). Thus,

$$
Q_{i\leftrightarrow j} = -Q_{j\leftrightarrow i} = \overline{s_i s_j} (J_i - J_j),\quad i,j = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{18.5}
$$

and, performing an energy balance on  $A_{i}$ ,

$$
Q_{i} = A_{i}q_{i} = A_{i}\left(J_{i} - H_{i}\right) = A_{i}J_{i} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_{i}s_{j}} J_{j},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{18.6}
$$

Thus, similar to the net radiation method, we must now assume that the surface zones are small enough so that their radiosities do not vary appreciably across them.

We may eliminate the radiosities from equation (18.6) by using equation (5.26),

$$
q_{i} = \frac{\epsilon_{i}}{1 - \epsilon_{i}}\left(E_{bi} - J_{i}\right),\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{18.7}
$$

This leads to

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left(\frac{A_j\delta_{ij}}{\epsilon_j} -\frac{1 - \epsilon_j}{\epsilon_j}\overline{s_is_j}\right)q_j = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left(A_j\delta_{ij} - \overline{s_is_j}\right)E_{bj},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{18.8}
$$

which is equivalent to equation (5.37). Thus, if all temperatures are known, the unknown wall heat fluxes may be determined by matrix inversion. If the zonal temperatures are not known, but must be determined iteratively by considering conduction and/or convection as well, then one matrix inversion must be performed for every iteration. To avoid such unnecessary matrix inversions (since the exchange areas do not depend on temperature), Hottel and Cohen [1] introduced the concept of total exchange areas, defined by

$$
Q_{i\leftrightarrow j} = -Q_{j\leftrightarrow i} = \overline{S_iS_j} (E_{bi} - E_{bj}),\quad i,j = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{18.9}
$$

which include energy exchange by direct travel as well as by paths with one or more surface reflections. This concept implies that reciprocity holds also for total exchange areas, that is,

$$
\overline{S_iS_j} = \overline{S_jS_i},\quad \mathrm{all}i,j. \tag{18.10}
$$

Once the  $\overline{S_iS_j}$  have been determined, the heat flux for each zone is found immediately and without matrix inversion from

$$
\begin{array}{l}{Q_{i} = A_{i}q_{i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{S_{i}S_{j}} (E_{bi} - E_{bj})}\\ {= \epsilon_{i}A_{i}E_{bi} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{S_{i}S_{j}} E_{bj},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N,} \end{array} \tag{18.11}
$$

where the last part of equation (18.11) follows from the fact that total emission from zone  $i$  is  $\epsilon_{i}A_{i}E_{bi}$ . We conclude that, for a nonparticipating medium,

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{S_iS_j} = \epsilon_iA_i,\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{18.12}
$$

There are many ways of expressing the total exchange areas  $\overline{S_iS_j}$  in terms of direct exchange areas  $\overline{s_i s_j}$ . Hottel and Cohen [1] and Hottel and Sarofim [2] achieved this by setting the emissive power of all zones to zero except for zone  $k$ , for which the emissive power is set to unity. From equation (18.11) it follows then that, for this case,

$$
Q_{i} = -\overline{S_{i}S_{k}} = A_{i}kJ_{i} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_{i}s_{j}} kJ_{j},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{18.13}
$$

where the presubscript  $k$  for the  $J_{i}$  implies that these artificial radiosities are for a single emitting zone with unit emissive power. The  $Q_{i}$  can be eliminated using equation (18.7), resulting in  $N$  simultaneous equations for the unknown  $kJ_{i}$ $(i = 1,2,\ldots ,N)$ . After their determination the  $\overline{S_iS_k}$  may be determined from equation (18.13). Utilizing a different approach Noble [13] cast the governing equations in matrix form and used elegant matrix manipulation to evaluate the total exchange areas. We shall follow here an approach similar to Noble's but shall use a somewhat

more conventional notation to accommodate the reader who is not very familiar with matrix manipulation.

Making a simple heat balance for zone  $i$ ,

$$
Q_{i} = \epsilon_{i}A_{i}E_{bi} - \epsilon_{i}A_{i}H_{i} \tag{18.14}
$$

(stating that the net heat flux leaving zone  $i$  is the difference between emitted and absorbed irradiation), we find from equation (18.6) that the direct exchange areas are related to the absorbed irradiation,  $\epsilon_{i}A_{i}H_{i}$ , where  $H_{i}$  is total irradiation per unit area on zone  $i$ , or

$$
A_{i}H_{i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_{i}s_{j}} J_{j},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{18.15}
$$

We now eliminate the radiosities from equation (18.15) using its definition, equation (5.18),

$$
J_{j} = \epsilon_{j}E_{bj} + \rho_{j}H_{j}, \tag{18.16}
$$

which leads to

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left(\frac{\delta_{ij}}{\epsilon_j} -\frac{\rho_j\overline{s_is_j}}{\epsilon_jA_j}\right)\epsilon_jA_jH_j = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_is_j}\epsilon_jE_{bj},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{18.17}
$$

Equation (18.17) is a set of  $N$  linear equations in the  $N$  unknown  $H_{j}$ . The general solution to this equation is most easily found by casting it into matrix form. We define two  $N\times N$  matrices (or second rank tensors),

$$
\mathbf{T} = \left( \begin{array}{cccccc}\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} -\frac{\rho_1\overline{s_1s_1}}{\epsilon_1A_1} & -\frac{\rho_2\overline{s_1s_2}}{\epsilon_2A_2} & \dots & -\frac{\rho_N\overline{s_1s_N}}{\epsilon_NA_N}\\ -\frac{\rho_1\overline{s_2s_1}}{\epsilon_1A_1} & \frac{1}{\epsilon_2} -\frac{\rho_2\overline{s_2s_2}}{\epsilon_2A_2} & \dots & -\frac{\rho_N\overline{s_2s_N}}{\epsilon_NA_N}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ -\frac{\rho_1\overline{s_Ns_1}}{\epsilon_1A_1} & -\frac{\rho_2\overline{s_Ns_2}}{\epsilon_2A_2} & \dots & \frac{1}{\epsilon_N} -\frac{\rho_N\overline{s_Ns_N}}{\epsilon_NA_N} \end{array} \right) \tag{18.18}
$$

and

$$
\mathbf{S} = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}\overline{s_1s_1}\epsilon_1 & \overline{s_1s_2}\epsilon_2 & \dots & \overline{s_1s_N}\epsilon_N\\ \overline{s_2s_1}\epsilon_1 & \overline{s_2s_2}\epsilon_2 & \dots & \overline{s_2s_N}\epsilon_N\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \overline{s_Ns_1}\epsilon_1 & \overline{s_Ns_2}\epsilon_2 & \dots & \overline{s_Ns_N}\epsilon_N \end{array} \right), \tag{18.19}
$$

as well as two vectors  $\mathbf{h}$  and  $\mathbf{e_b}$ ,

$$
\mathbf{h} = \left( \begin{array}{c}\epsilon_{1}A_{1}H_{1}\\ \epsilon_{2}A_{2}H_{2}\\ \vdots \\ \epsilon_{N}A_{N}H_{N} \end{array} \right),\quad \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{b}} = \left( \begin{array}{c}E_{b1}\\ E_{b2}\\ \vdots \\ E_{bN} \end{array} \right). \tag{18.20}
$$

Equation (18.17) may then be rewritten<sup>2</sup> as

$$
\mathbf{T}\cdot \mathbf{h} = \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{b}}. \tag{18.21}
$$

If we form the dot product of equation (18.21) with the inverse of  $\mathbf{T}$ , or  $\mathbf{T}^{- 1}$ , we get

$$
\mathbf{T}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{T}\cdot \mathbf{h} = \mathbf{h} = \mathbf{T}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{b}}, \tag{18.22}
$$

where we have made use of the fact that  $\mathbf{T}^{- 1}\cdot \mathbf{T} = \delta$ , where  $\delta$  is the unit tensor with elements  $\delta_{ij}$ , and  $\delta \cdot \mathbf{h} = \left[\Sigma_j\delta_{ij}h_j\right] = [h_1] = \mathbf{h}$ . Thus, we may write, in series notation,

$$
\epsilon_{i}A_{i}H_{i} = \sum_{k = 1}^{N}\sum_{j = 1}^{N}(T^{-1})_{ik}S_{kj}E_{bj}. \tag{18.23}
$$

By comparing this expression with equations (18.11) and (18.14) we find the total exchange areas as

$$
\overline{S_iS_j} = \sum_{k = 1}^{N}(T^{-1})_{ik}S_{kj}, \tag{18.24}
$$

or, in matrix notation

$$
\overline{\mathbf{SS}} = \mathbf{T}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{S}. \tag{18.25}
$$

We note in passing that, for every black zone, an entire column of  $\mathbf{T}$  has elements that are zero (with the exception of the diagonal term), simplifying the inversion of  $\mathbf{T}$ .

Example 18.1. Evaluate the radiative heat flux between two infinitely long concentric cylinders separated by a nonparticipating medium. Both cylinders are isothermal and are covered with a gray, diffusely emitting and reflecting material. The inner cylinder is of radius  $R_{1}$  with temperature  $T_{1}$  and emittance  $\epsilon_{1}$ . The outer cylinder has the corresponding values of  $R_{2},T_{2}$ , and  $\epsilon_{2}$ . Use the zonal method and employ the concept of total exchange areas.

# Solution

Letting the inner cylinder be Zone 1 and the outer cylinder Zone 2 we have

$$
\overline{S_1S_2} = \overline{S_2S_1} = A_1F_{1\rightarrow 2} = A_1,\quad \overline{S_1S_1} = 0,\quad \overline{S_2S_2} = A_2F_{2\rightarrow 2} = A_2 - A_1.
$$

Therefore, we get

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{T} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{\epsilon_1} & -\frac{\rho_2}{\epsilon_2}\frac{A_1}{A_2}\\ -\frac{\rho_1}{\epsilon_1} & 1 + \frac{\rho_2}{\epsilon_2}\frac{A_1}{A_2} \end{array} \right),\\ \mathbf{S} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}0 & A_1\epsilon_2\\ A_1\epsilon_1 & (A_2 - A_1)\epsilon_2 \end{array} \right). \end{array}
$$

The inverse of  $\mathbf{T}$  follows immediately as

$$
\mathbf{T}^{-1} = \frac{1}{T}\left( \begin{array}{cc}1 + \frac{\rho_2}{\epsilon_2}\frac{A_1}{A_2} & \frac{\rho_2}{\epsilon_2}\frac{A_1}{A_2}\\ \displaystyle \frac{\rho_1}{\epsilon_1} & \frac{1}{\epsilon_1} \end{array} \right),
$$

where

$$
T = |\mathbf{T}| = \frac{1}{\epsilon_1} +\frac{\rho_2}{\epsilon_2}\frac{A_1}{A_2}.
$$

The total exchange areas are calculated from

$$
\overline{S_iS_j} = \sum_{k = 1}^{2}(T^{-1})_{ik}S_{kj},
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\overline{S_1S_1} = T_{11}^{-1}S_{11} + T_{12}^{-1}S_{21} = \frac{1}{T}\frac{\rho_2}{\epsilon_2}\frac{A_1}{A_2} A_1\epsilon_1,}\\ & {\overline{S_1S_2} = T_{11}^{-1}S_{12} + T_{12}^{-1}S_{22} = \overline{S_2S_1}}\\ & {\qquad = \frac{1}{T}\left[\left(1 + \frac{\rho_2}{\epsilon_2}\frac{A_1}{A_2}\right)A_1\epsilon_2 + \frac{\rho_2}{\epsilon_2}\frac{A_1}{A_2} (A_2 - A_1)\epsilon_2\right] = \frac{A_1}{T},}\\ & {\overline{S_2S_2} = T_{21}^{-1}S_{12} + T_{22}^{-1}S_{22} = \frac{1}{T}\left[\frac{\rho_1}{\epsilon_1} A_1\epsilon_2 + \frac{\epsilon_2}{\epsilon_1} (A_2 - A_1)\right].} \end{array}
$$

The net heat flux at Surface 1 follows as

$$
Q_{1} = A_{1}q_{1} = \overline{S_{1}S_{2}} (E_{b1} - E_{b2})
$$

or

$$
\Psi_{1} = \frac{q_{1}}{\sigma(T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4})} = \frac{1}{T} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_{1}} + \frac{A_{1}}{A_{2}}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2}} - 1\right)}.
$$

This is, of course, somewhat of a hard way to arrive at the well- known result. The method will save considerable computer time, however, if many zones and iterative determination of the temperature field are involved.

# 18.3 RADIATIVE EXCHANGE IN GRAY ABSORBING/EMITTING MEDIA

We shall now consider radiative transfer through a gray absorbing, emitting, but nonscattering medium with constant absorption coefficient. The medium is confined by an enclosure with gray, diffusely emitting and reflecting surfaces. Again, the surfaces are broken into  $N$  isothermal zones (with weakly varying radiosities), while the medium is broken into  $K$  isothermal volume zones. There will now be radiative transfer between surface zones and other surface zones, from surface zones to volume zones and vice versa, and from volume zones to volume zones.

# Direct Exchange Areas

# Surface-Surface Exchange

The direct exchange area between two surface zones is defined, as for pure surface exchange, by

$$
Q_{i\rightarrow j} = \overline{s_i s_j} J_i,
$$

where  $Q_{i\rightarrow j}$  is the total heat flux coming from zone  $i$  that travels directly (without reflections) to zone  $j$ . The exchange areas are the same as in the last section, except that only a fraction of the energy leaving  $i$  toward  $j$  will arrive at  $j$  (while the rest will be absorbed by the medium). Thus, similar to the development of standard view factors developed in Chapter 4, we find that the heat flux leaving zone  $i$  arriving at  $j =$  intensity leaving  $dA_{i}$  into the direction of  $dA_{j} \times$  area normal to ray  $\times$  solid angle subtended by  $dA_{j}$  as seen from  $dA_{i} \times$  fraction transmitted, or

$$
\left(\frac{J_1}{\pi}\right)\times \left(dA_i\cos \theta_i\right)\times \left(\frac{dA_j\cos\theta_j}{S^2}\right)\times e^{-\kappa S},
$$

![](images/6bd7823f207b59753f3dc9255778a776f4f82fcd33ce3906bbd31137e7e5e954.jpg)  
FIGURE 18-2 Radiative exchange between (a) two differential surface elements, (b) differential volume and surface elements, (c) two differential volume elements.

as shown in Fig. 18- 2a. The surface- to- surface direct exchange area may, therefore, be determined from

$$
\overline{s_i s_j} = \int_{A_i}\int_{A_j}e^{-\kappa S}\frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{\pi S^2} dA_jdA_i. \tag{18.26}
$$

Equation (18.26) is identical to equation (18.2) except for the transmission factor  $e^{- \kappa S}$ .

# Volume-Surface Exchange

The volume- to- surface direct exchange area is defined similarly through

$$
Q_{i\rightarrow j} = \overline{g_i s_j} E_{bi}.
$$

Inspecting Fig. 18- 2b, we find that the heat flux emitted from volume zone  $i$  arriving at surface zone  $j =$  energy emitted from  $dV_{i}$  into all  $4\pi$  directions as given by equation (10.54)  $\times$  fraction leaving toward  $dA_{j}\times$  fraction transmitted, or

$$
(4\kappa E_{bi}dV_{i})\times \left(\frac{dA_{j}\cos\theta_{j}}{4\pi S^{2}}\right)\times e^{-\kappa S},
$$

leading to a volume- to- surface direct exchange area of

$$
\overline{g_i s_j} = \int_{V_i}\int_{A_j}e^{-\kappa S}\frac{\cos\theta_j}{\pi S^2}\kappa dA_jdV_i. \tag{18.27}
$$

# Volume-Volume Exchange

The volume- to- volume direct exchange area is related to heat flux leaving one zone and absorbed by another after direct travel (without reflections) through

$$
Q_{i\rightarrow j} = \overline{g_i g_j} E_{bi}.
$$

The magnitude of the direct exchange area is most easily derived by orienting the receiving volume,  $dV_{j} = dA_{j}\times dS_{j},$  as shown in Fig. 18- 2c: The heat flux from  $i$  intercepted by  $j$  is equal to energy emitted from  $dV_{i}$  into all  $4\pi$  directions  $\times$  fraction leaving toward  $dA_{j}\times$  fraction transmitted  $\times$  fraction absorbed over  $dS_{j},$  or

$$
(4\kappa E_{bi}dV_{i})\times \left(\frac{dA_{j}}{4\pi S^{2}}\right)\times (e^{-\kappa S})\times (\kappa dS_{j}),
$$

leading to a volume- to- volume direct exchange area of

$$
\overline{g_i g_j} = \int_{V_i}\int_{V_j}e^{-\kappa S}\frac{\kappa^2}{\pi S^2} dV_j dV_i. \tag{18.28}
$$

Making the same arguments in the opposite direction, or by inspecting equations (18.26) through (18.28), we find that reciprocity for direct exchange areas holds, that is,

$$
\overline{s_i s_j} = \overline{s_j s_i},\quad \overline{g_i s_j} = \overline{s_j g_i},\quad \overline{g_i g_j} = \overline{g_j g_i}. \tag{18.29}
$$

Making an energy balance on surface zone  $i$ , we have

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {Q_{si} = A_iq_i = A_i(J_i - H_{si}) = A_i\epsilon_i(E_{bsi} - H_{si})}\\ & {\quad = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_j}\overline{s_i} (J_i - J_j) + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_k}\overline{s_i} (J_i - E_{bgk})}\\ & {\quad = \epsilon_i\Bigg(A_iE_{bsi} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_j}\overline{s_i} J_j - \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_k}\overline{s_i} E_{bgk}\Bigg),\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N,} \end{array} \tag{18.30}
$$

where we have added the subscripts  $s$  and  $g$  to distinguish between emissive powers and irradiation of surface and volume zones, respectively.

The first version of equation (18.30) uses the concept that the net heat flux at zone  $i$  is equal to the sum of the net exchange between any two zones, and the second states that net heat flux is equal to total emission minus the absorbed fraction of total irradiation. Realizing that the exchange areas do not depend on temperatures and that, for an isothermal enclosure, all heat fluxes go to zero (as well as  $J_{j} = E_{bj}$ ), we get the relationship

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_j s_i} +\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_k}\overline{s_i} = A_i,i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{18.31}
$$

Similarly, making an energy balance over a volume zone, we find

$$
\begin{array}{l}{Q_{gi} = \kappa V_{i}(4E_{bgi} - G_{i}) = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_{j}g_{i}}\left(E_{bgi} - J_{j}\right) + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_{k}g_{i}}\left(E_{bgi} - E_{bgk}\right)}\\ {= 4\kappa V_{i}E_{bgi} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_{j}g_{i}} J_{j} - \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_{k}g_{i}} E_{bgk},i = 1,2,\ldots ,K.} \end{array} \tag{18.32}
$$

Comparing, or looking at an isothermal enclosure, we find

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_j}\overline{g_i} +\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_k}\overline{g_i} = 4\kappa V_i,i = 1,2,\ldots ,K. \tag{18.33}
$$

For a volume zone the  $Q_{gi}$  represents the net radiative source within volume  $V_{i}$  and is, therefore,

$$
Q_{gi} = \int_{V_i}\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}dV_i. \tag{18.34}
$$

If the  $Q_{si}$  for surface zones are eliminated through equation (18.7), and if the  $Q_{gi}$  for volume zones are known (by assuming radiative equilibrium) or the gas zone emissive powers are known (through connection with an overall energy equation), then equations (18.30) and (18.32) form a system of  $N + K$  equations in the unknowns  $J_{i}(i = 1,2,\ldots ,N)$  and  $Q_{gk}$  or  $E_{bgk}(k = 1,2,\ldots ,K)$ .

# Total Exchange Areas

Again, we would like to eliminate the radiosities,  $J_{j},$  from equations (18.30) and (18.32) to avoid repeated matrix inversions in case the zonal temperatures must be determined by iteration. The total exchange areas are defined by

$$
\begin{array}{c}{Q_{si} = \epsilon_iA_iE_{bsi} - \sum_{j = 1}^{K}\overline{S_iS_j} E_{bsj} - \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{S_iG_k} E_{bgk},\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N,}\\ {Q_{gi} = 4\kappa V_iE_{bgj} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{G_iS_j} E_{bsj} - \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{G_iG_k} E_{bgk},\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,K.} \end{array} \tag{18.36}
$$

The law of reciprocity follows again from the definition of total exchange areas, that is,

$$
\overline{S_jS_i} = \overline{S_iS_j},\qquad \overline{G_kS_i} = \overline{S_iG_k},\qquad \overline{G_kG_i} = \overline{G_iG_k}, \tag{18.37}
$$

and, setting all emissive powers equal in equations (18.35) and (18.36) (resulting in zero heat fluxes everywhere) gives the relations

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{S_iS_j} +\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{S_iG_k} = \epsilon_iA_i,\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N,}\\ {\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{G_iS_j} +\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{G_iG_k} = 4\kappa V_i,\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,K.} \end{array} \tag{18.39}
$$

To determine the total exchange factors, we extract the surface irradiation from equation (18.30), giving

$$
A_{i}H_{si} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_{i}s_{j}} J_{j} + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{s_{i}g_{k}} E_{bgk},\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \tag{18.40}
$$

or, after using equation (18.16),

$$
\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left(\frac{\delta_{ij}}{\epsilon_j} -\frac{\rho_j\overline{s_i\overline{s_j}}}{\epsilon_jA_j}\right)\epsilon_jA_jH_{sj} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_i\overline{s_j}}\epsilon_jE_{bsj} + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{s_i\overline{g_k}} E_{bgk},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N. \tag{18.41}
$$

In vector notation we may write4

$$
\mathbf{T}\cdot \mathbf{h}_s = \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bs}} + \overline{\mathbf{s}\mathbf{g}}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bg}}, \tag{18.42}
$$

where  $\mathbf{T},\mathbf{h}_s,\mathbf{S},\mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bs}}$  are defined as in the previous section (although the direct exchange areas in them are different because of the transmission factor), while the other two are defined as

$$
\overline{\mathbf{s}\mathbf{g}} = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}\overline{s_1\overline{g_1}} & \overline{s_1\overline{g_2}} & \dots & \overline{s_1\overline{g_K}}\\ \overline{s_2\overline{g_1}} & \overline{s_2\overline{g_2}} & \dots & \overline{s_2\overline{g_K}}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \overline{s_N\overline{g_1}} & \overline{s_N\overline{g_2}} & \dots & \overline{s_N\overline{g_K}} \end{array} \right),\quad \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bg}} = \left( \begin{array}{c}E_{bg1}\\ E_{bg2}\\ \vdots \\ E_{bgK} \end{array} \right). \tag{18.43}
$$

Note that  $\mathbf{T}$  and  $\mathbf{S}$  are  $N\times N$  matrices and  $\mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{s}}$  and  $\mathbf{e}_{\mathrm{bs}}$  are  $N$ - vectors, while  $\overline{\mathbf{sg}}$  is an  $N\times K$  matrix and  $\mathbf{e}_{\mathrm{bg}}$  is a  $K$ - vector. Inverting  $\mathbf{T}$  gives

$$
\mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{s}} = \mathbf{T}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bs}} + \mathbf{T}^{-1}\cdot \overline{\mathbf{sg}}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bg}}, \tag{18.44}
$$

and, after comparing with equation (18.35), the total exchange areas can be identified as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\overline{\mathbf{SS}} = \mathbf{T}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{S},\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \overline{S_iS_j} = \sum_{l = 1}^{N}(T^{-1})_{il}S_{lj},\\ \displaystyle \overline{\mathbf{SG}} = \mathbf{T}^{-1}\cdot \overline{\mathbf{sg}},\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \overline{S_iG_k} = \sum_{l = 1}^{N}(T^{-1})_{il}\overline{S_lg_k}. \end{array} \tag{18.46}
$$

A similar procedure for the volume zones gives, from equation (18.32),

$$
\begin{array}{l}\kappa V_{i}G_{i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{g_{iS_{j}}} J_{j} + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_{i}g_{k}} E_{bgk},\\ \displaystyle = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{g_{iS_{j}}} (\epsilon_{j}E_{bsj} + \rho_{j}H_{sj}) + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_{i}g_{k}} E_{bgk},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,K. \end{array} \tag{18.47}
$$

Remembering that  $h_{sj} = \epsilon_{i}A_{j}H_{sj}$  and using equations (18.44) and (18.45), we find that equation (18.47) is transformed to

$$
\begin{array}{l}\kappa V_{i}G_{i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{g_{i}S_{j}}\epsilon_{j}E_{bsj} + \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{\frac{g_{i}S_{j}}{A_{j}}}\frac{\rho_{j}}{\epsilon_{j}}\sum_{l = 1}^{N}\overline{S_{j}S_{l}} E_{bsl}\\ \displaystyle +\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{\frac{g_{i}S_{j}}{A_{j}}}\frac{\rho_{j}}{\epsilon_{j}}\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{S_{j}G_{k}} E_{bgk} + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_{i}g_{k}} E_{bgk},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,K. \end{array} \tag{18.48}
$$

Switching the dummy counters  $j$  and  $l$  in the second term on the right- hand side and rearranging, we have

$$
\begin{array}{l}\kappa V_{i}G_{i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left(\overline{g_{i}S_{j}}\epsilon_{j} + \sum_{l = 1}^{N}\overline{\frac{g_{i}S_{l}}{A_{l}}}\frac{\rho_{l}}{\epsilon_{l}}\overline{S_{l}S_{j}}\right)E_{bsj}\\ \displaystyle +\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\left(\overline{\overline{g_{i}g_{k}}} +\sum_{l = 1}^{N}\overline{\frac{g_{i}S_{l}}{A_{l}}}\frac{\rho_{l}}{\epsilon_{l}}\overline{S_{l}G_{k}}\right)E_{bgk},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,K. \end{array} \tag{18.49}
$$

By comparison with equation (18.36), we find

$$
\begin{array}{l}\overline{G_iS_j} = \overline{g_iS_j}\epsilon_j + \sum_{l = 1}^{N}\overline{\frac{g_iS_l}{A_l}}\frac{\rho_l}{\epsilon_l}\overline{S_lS_j},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,K,\\ \displaystyle \overline{G_iG_k} = \overline{g_ig_k} +\sum_{l = 1}^{N}\overline{\frac{g_iS_l}{A_l}}\frac{\rho_l}{\epsilon_l}\overline{S_lG_k},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,K, \end{array} \tag{18.51}
$$

or, in matrix notation

$$
\begin{array}{r}\overline{\mathbf{GS}} = \mathbf{R} + \mathbf{Q}\cdot \overline{\mathbf{SS}},\\ \overline{\mathbf{GG}} = \overline{\mathbf{gg}} +\mathbf{Q}\cdot \overline{\mathbf{SG}}, \end{array} \tag{18.53}
$$

where

$$
\mathbf{R} = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}\overline{g_1s_1}\epsilon_1 & \overline{g_1s_2}\epsilon_2 & \dots & \overline{g_1s_N}\epsilon_N\\ \overline{g_2s_1}\epsilon_1 & \overline{g_2s_2}\epsilon_2 & \dots & \overline{g_2s_N}\epsilon_N\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \overline{g_ks_1}\epsilon_1 & \overline{g_ks_2}\epsilon_2 & \dots & \overline{g_ks_N}\epsilon_N \end{array} \right), \tag{18.54}
$$

$$
\mathbf{Q} = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}\overline{g_1s_1}\rho_1 & \overline{g_1s_2}\rho_2 & \dots & \overline{g_1s_N}\rho_N\\ \overline{A_1}\epsilon_1 & \overline{A_2}\epsilon_2 & \dots & \overline{A_N}\epsilon_N\\ \overline{g_2s_1}\rho_1 & \overline{g_2s_2}\rho_2 & \dots & \overline{g_2s_N}\rho_N\\ \overline{A_1}\epsilon_1 & \overline{A_2}\epsilon_2 & \dots & \overline{A_N}\epsilon_N\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \overline{g_ks_1}\rho_1 & \overline{g_ks_2}\rho_2 & \dots & \overline{g_ks_N}\rho_N\\ \overline{A_1}\epsilon_1 & \overline{A_2}\epsilon_2 & \dots & \overline{A_N}\epsilon_N \end{array} \right). \tag{18.55}
$$

Because of reciprocity  $\overline{G_kS_j} = \overline{S_kG_k}$  or  $\overline{\mathbf{GS}} = \overline{\mathbf{SG}}^T$  (where the superscript  $T$  denotes the transpose of a matrix) and

$$
\mathbf{R} + \mathbf{Q}\cdot \overline{\mathbf{SS}} = \overline{\mathbf{gs}}\cdot (\mathbf{T}^{-1})^T. \tag{18.56}
$$

Obviously, the  $\overline{G_kS_j}$  may be evaluated using either of equations (18.46) and (18.50) (or both, using one as a checking mechanism).

Example 18.2. Consider a gray, absorbing- emitting (but not scattering) isothermal medium confined between two parallel, isothermal, gray and diffuse plates. The temperature of the medium is  $T_{m}$ , its absorption coefficient is  $\kappa$ , and the distance between the plates is  $L$ . Both plates have the same temperature,  $T_{w}$ , and emittance,  $\epsilon$ . Determine the net radiative heat flux at the plates.

# Solution

We begin by evaluating the direct exchange areas. Since the problem is one- dimensional with infinitely large plates, all direct and total exchange areas will become infinitely large. Thus, we shall evaluate all exchange areas per unit area, using a tilde instead of a bar in the notation. From equation (18.26)

$$
\widetilde{s_1s_2} = \lim_{A_1\to \infty}\frac{1}{A_1}\int_{A_1}\int_{A_2}e^{-\kappa S}\frac{\cos\theta_1\cos\theta_2}{\pi S^2} dA_2dA_1 = \int_{A_2}e^{-\kappa S}\frac{\cos\theta_1\cos\theta_2}{\pi S^2} dA_2,
$$

since the exchange factor between any point on Surface 1 and all of Surface 2 is the same everywhere. Thus, we get, with  $\cos \theta_{1} = \cos \theta_{2} = L / S, S^{2} = \gamma^{2} + L^{2}$  and  $\tau_{L} = \kappa L$ ,

$$
\widetilde{s_1s_2} = \int_0^\infty e^{-\kappa S}\frac{L^2}{\pi S^4} 2\pi rdr = 2\int_1^\infty e^{-\tau_{LL}}\frac{dy}{\gamma^3} = 2E_3(\tau_L),
$$

where  $\gamma = S / L = \sqrt{(r / L)^2 + 1}$ . We also have  $\widetilde{s_1s_1} = \widetilde{s_2s_2} = 0$  and  $\widetilde{s_2s_1} = \widetilde{s_1s_2}$ . From equation (18.31), it follows immediately that

$$
\widetilde{g_5} = 1 - \widetilde{s_1s_2} = \widetilde{g_5} = \widetilde{g} s = \widetilde{sg},
$$

and, from equation (18.33),

$$
\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g} = 4\tau_{L} - 2\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g}.
$$

To determine the total exchange factors, we first establish the relevant matrices,

$$
\mathbf{T} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{\epsilon} & -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}}\\ -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}} & \frac{1}{\epsilon} \end{array} \right),\quad T = \frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}\left[1 - \rho^{2}\left(\widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}}\right)^{2}\right],
$$

$$
\mathbf{T}^{-1} = \frac{1}{T}\left( \begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{\epsilon} & \frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}}\\ \rho & \frac{1}{\epsilon} \end{array} \right),\quad \mathbf{S} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}0 & \epsilon \widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}}\\ \epsilon \widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}} & 0 \end{array} \right),
$$

where  $\mathbf{S}$  is also evaluated per unit area. Now, from equations (18.45) and (18.46)

$$
\begin{array}{l}\widetilde{s_1\widetilde{s_1}} = \frac{1}{T}\rho (s\widetilde{s_2})^2 = \widetilde{S_2\widetilde{S_2}},\quad \widetilde{S_1\widetilde{S_2}} = \frac{1}{T}\widetilde{s_1\widetilde{s_2}} = \widetilde{S_2\widetilde{S_1}},\\ \widetilde{s_1\widetilde{G}} = \frac{1}{T}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} +\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\widetilde{s_1\widetilde{s_2}}\right)\widetilde{sg} = \widetilde{S_2\widetilde{G}} = \widetilde{SG} = \widetilde{GS}. \end{array}
$$

The last result may be verified by comparing with the result from equation (18.50). Finally with

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\bf Q} = \left(\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\widetilde{sg}\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\widetilde{sg}\right),\\ \widetilde{GG} = \widetilde{gg} +2\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\widetilde{sg}\widetilde{SG} = \widetilde{gg} +\frac{2\rho}{\epsilon^2T}\left(1 + \rho \widetilde{S_1S_2}\right)\left(\widetilde{sg}\right)^2. \end{array}
$$

These results are readily (and should be) verified by substituting into equations (18.38) and (18.39). The net heat flux to a plate is calculated from equation (18.35) as

$$
q_{w} = \left(\epsilon -\widetilde{S_{1}S_{1}} -\widetilde{S_{1}S_{2}}\right)E_{bw} - \widetilde{SG} E_{bm} = \widetilde{SG}\left(E_{bw} - E_{bm}\right),
$$

or

$$
\Psi = \frac{q_w}{\sigma\left(T_w^4 - T_m^4\right)} = \widetilde{SG} = \frac{\epsilon\left[1 - 2E_3(\tau_L)\right]}{1 - 2\rho E_3(\tau_L)},
$$

which is, of course, the exact result.

A number of researchers have applied the zonal method to gray media without scattering. For example, Einstein calculated combined convective/radiative heat fluxes for two- dimensional duct flow for a gray gas in a black- walled duct [4, 5] and Modest investigated radiative equilibrium in a rectangular enclosure with a single nonblack wall [14], and for the space between concentric, gray cylinders [15].

# 18.4 RADIATIVE EXCHANGE IN GRAY MEDIA WITH ISOTROPIC SCATTERING

We shall now extend the zonal method to the most general case to which it can be applied by including the effects of isotropic scattering and spatially varying absorption and scattering coefficients. As before, we break up the surfaces into  $N$  isothermal zones (with weakly varying. radiosities) and the medium into  $K$  isothermal volume zones (which, as we shall see, should have weakly varying radiative source terms). We shall rederive the expressions for direct exchange areas by making allowance for property variations as well as for isotropic scattering.

# Direct Exchange Areas

# Surface-Surface Exchange

The direct exchange area between two surface zones applies now to total heat flux coming from zone  $i$  traveling to  $j$  directly without reflections and without being scattered. Therefore,

equation (18.26) must be rewritten as

$$
\overline{s_i s_j} = \int_{A_i}\int_{A_j}e^{-\beta_{ij}S}\frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{\pi S^2} dA_jdA_i, \tag{18.57}
$$

where

$$
\beta_{ij} = \frac{1}{S}\int_{0}^{S}\beta dS \tag{18.58}
$$

is the average extinction coefficient between zones  $i$  and  $j$ . In general, of course, the value for  $\beta_{ij}$  would be different for any two zones.

# Volume-Surface Exchange

Radiative energy leaves an infinitesimal volume not only in the form of isotropic emission  $(= 4\pi \kappa_{i}I_{bgi} = 4\kappa_{i}E_{bgi})$  but also as isotropic out- scattering  $(= \sigma_{si}G_{i},$  where  $\sigma_{s}$  is the scattering coefficient).5 Defining a volume zone radiosity as

$$
J_{g} = (1 - \omega)E_{bg} + \frac{\omega}{4} G, \tag{18.59}
$$

we may express the direct exchange of energy between volume and surface zones as

$$
Q_{i\leftrightarrow j} = \overline{g_i s_j} (J_{gi} - J_{sj}), \tag{18.60}
$$

and equation (18.27) becomes

$$
\overline{g_i s_j} = \int_{V_i}\int_{A_j}e^{-\beta_{ij}S}\frac{\cos\theta_j}{\pi S^2}\beta_i dA_j dV_i. \tag{18.61}
$$

Therefore, with this definition we demand that we may assume the volume zone radiosity,  $J_{g}$ , to be constant throughout the zone.

# Volume-Volume Exchange

By the same reasoning we need to redefine the volume- to- volume direct exchange areas as

$$
\overline{g_i g_j} = \int_{V_i}\int_{V_j}e^{-\beta_{ij}S}\frac{\beta_i\beta_j}{\pi S^2} dV_jdV_i, \tag{18.62}
$$

where the  $\beta_{i}$  comes from averaging the source term over  $dV_{i},$  and the  $\beta_{j}$  is associated with the extinction in  $dV_{j}$

Rewriting the energy balance for surface zone  $i$ , equation (18.30), we get

$$
\begin{array}{l}{Q_{si} = A_iq_i = A_i(J_{si} - H_{si}) = A_i\epsilon_i(E_{bsi} - H_{si})}\\ {= \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_i g_j} (J_{si} - J_{sj}) + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{s_i g_k} (J_{si} - J_{gk})}\\ {= \epsilon_i\left(A_iE_{bsi} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_i\overline{s_j} J_{sj}} -\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{s_i g_k} J_{gk}\right),\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N.} \end{array} \tag{18.63}
$$

Similarly, for a volume zone, equation (18.32) is rewritten as

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}{Q_{gi}} & = & {\kappa_iV_i(4E_{bgj} - G_i) = \beta_iV_i(4J_{gi} - G_i)}\\ {} & {} & {= \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{g_is_j} (J_{gi} - J_{sj}) + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_i\overline{g_k}} (J_{gi} - J_{gk})}\\ {} & {} & {= 4\kappa_iV_iE_{bgj} - (1 - \omega_i)\left(\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{g_is_j} J_{sj} + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_i\overline{g_k}} J_{gk}\right),\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,K.} \end{array} \tag{18.64}
$$

Examining an isothermal enclosure, we find that equations (18.31) and (18.33) continue to hold, if the absorption coefficient is replaced by the extinction coefficient everywhere, and if the extinction coefficient (and, therefore, the direct exchange areas) does not depend on temperature:

$$
\begin{array}{rl}\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_js_i} +\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_ks_i} = A_i, & i = 1,2,\ldots ,N,\\ \displaystyle \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_j\overline{g_j}i} +\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_ig_i} = 4\beta_iV_i, & i = 1,2,\ldots ,K. \end{array} \tag{18.66}
$$

Eliminating the radiosities from equations (18.63) and (18.64) through equations (18.16) and (18.59), we obtain, in a similar fashion as for equations (18.41) and (18.47),

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\bigg(\delta_{ij}\quad \rho_{j}\overline{s_{i}s_{j}}\bigg)h_{sj} - \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{s_{i}\overline{g_{k}}}\omega_{k}h_{gk}}\\ & {\quad \quad \quad = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{s_{i}s_{j}}\epsilon_{j}E_{bsj} + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{s_{i}\overline{g_{k}}}(1 - \omega_{k})E_{bgk},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N,}\\ & {\quad \quad -\sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{g_{i}s_{j}}\rho_{j}h_{sj} + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\bigg(\frac{\delta_{ik}}{1 - \omega_{k}} -\frac{\overline{g_{i}g_{k}}\omega_{k}}{4\kappa_{k}V_{k}}\bigg)h_{gk}}\\ & {\quad \quad \quad = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{g_{i}s_{j}}\epsilon_{j}E_{bsj} + \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{g_{i}\overline{g_{k}}}(1 - \omega_{k})E_{bgk},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,K,} \end{array} \tag{18.68}
$$

where  $h_{gk} = \kappa_k V_k G_k$ . Equations (18.67) and (18.68) are a system of  $N + k$  equations in the  $N + K$  unknown  $h_{sj}$  and  $h_{gk}$ . A solution may be found by standard techniques.

# Total Exchange Areas

If the temperature field is to be determined iteratively, determination of total exchange areas is again desirable so long as radiative properties and, therefore, direct and total exchange areas do not vary with temperature (although they may vary with location). We may rewrite equations (18.67) and (18.68) in matrix notation as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{T}\cdot \mathbf{h}_s - \mathbf{U}\cdot \mathbf{h}_g = \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bs}} + \mathbf{V}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bg}},\\ -\mathbf{Q}\cdot \mathbf{h}_s + \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{h}_g = \mathbf{R}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bs}} + \mathbf{X}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bg}}, \end{array} \tag{18.70}
$$

where  $\mathbf{T}, \mathbf{S}, \mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{R}, \mathbf{e}_{\mathrm{bs}}, \mathbf{e}_{\mathrm{bg}}$ , and  $\mathbf{h}_{\mathrm{s}}$  have been defined in the previous section and

$$
\mathbf{U} = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}\overline{s_{1}g_{1}} \omega_{1} & \overline{s_{1}g_{2}} \omega_{2} & \ldots & \overline{s_{1}g_{K}} \omega_{K} \\ \overline{4\kappa_{1}} V_{1} & \overline{4\kappa_{2}} V_{2} & \ldots & \overline{4\kappa_{K}} V_{K} \\ \overline{s_{2}g_{1}} \omega_{1} & \overline{s_{2}g_{2}} \omega_{2} & \ldots & \overline{s_{2}g_{K}} \omega_{K} \\ \overline{4\kappa_{1}} V_{1} & \overline{4\kappa_{2}} V_{2} & \ldots & \overline{4\kappa_{K}} V_{K} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \overline{s_{N}g_{1}} \omega_{1} & \overline{s_{N}g_{2}} \omega_{2} & \ldots & \overline{s_{N}g_{K}} \omega_{K} \\ \overline{4\kappa_{1}} V_{1} & \overline{4\kappa_{2}} V_{2} & \ldots & \overline{4\kappa_{K}} V_{K} \end{array} \right), \tag{18.71}
$$

$$
\mathbf{W} = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}\frac{1}{1 - \omega_{1}} -\frac{\overline{g_{1}g_{1}}\omega_{1}}{4\kappa_{1}V_{1}} & -\frac{\overline{g_{1}g_{2}}\omega_{2}}{4\kappa_{2}V_{2}} & \ldots & -\frac{\overline{g_{1}g_{K}}\omega_{K}}{4\kappa_{K}V_{K}} \\ -\frac{\overline{g_{2}g_{1}}\omega_{1}}{4\kappa_{1}V_{1}} & \frac{1}{1 - \omega_{2}} -\frac{\overline{g_{2}g_{2}}\omega_{2}}{4\kappa_{2}V_{2}} & \ldots & -\frac{\overline{g_{2}g_{K}}\omega_{K}}{4\kappa_{K}V_{K}} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ -\frac{\overline{g_{K}g_{1}}\omega_{1}}{4\kappa_{1}V_{1}} & -\frac{\overline{g_{K}g_{2}}\omega_{2}}{4\kappa_{2}V_{2}} & \ldots & \frac{1}{1 - \omega_{K}} -\frac{\overline{g_{K}g_{K}}\omega_{K}}{4\kappa_{K}V_{K}} \end{array} \right), \tag{18.72}
$$

$$
\mathbf{V} = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}\overline{s_{1}g_{1}} (1 - \omega_{1}) & \overline{s_{1}g_{2}} (1 - \omega_{2}) & \dots & \overline{s_{1}g_{K}} (1 - \omega_{k}) \\ \overline{s_{2}g_{1}} (1 - \omega_{1}) & \overline{s_{2}g_{2}} (1 - \omega_{2}) & \dots & \overline{s_{2}g_{K}} (1 - \omega_{k}) \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \overline{s_{N}g_{1}} (1 - \omega_{1}) & \overline{s_{N}g_{2}} (1 - \omega_{2}) & \dots & \overline{s_{N}g_{K}} (1 - \omega_{k}) \end{array} \right), \tag{18.73}
$$

$$
\mathbf{X} = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}\overline{g_{1}g_{1}} (1 - \omega_{1}) & \overline{g_{1}g_{2}} (1 - \omega_{2}) & \dots & \overline{g_{1}g_{K}} (1 - \omega_{k}) \\ \overline{g_{2}g_{1}} (1 - \omega_{1}) & \overline{g_{2}g_{2}} (1 - \omega_{2}) & \dots & \overline{g_{2}g_{K}} (1 - \omega_{k}) \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \overline{g_{K}g_{1}} (1 - \omega_{1}) & \overline{g_{K}g_{2}} (1 - \omega_{2}) & \dots & \overline{g_{K}g_{K}} (1 - \omega_{k}) \end{array} \right), \tag{18.74}
$$

$$
\mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{g}} = \left( \begin{array}{c}\kappa_{1}V_{1}G_{1} \\ \kappa_{2}V_{2}G_{2} \\ \vdots \\ \kappa_{K}V_{K}G_{K} \end{array} \right). \tag{18.75}
$$

Inverting  $\mathbf{W}$ , we can solve equation (18.70) for  $\mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{g}}$  as

$$
\mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{g}} = \mathbf{W}^{-1} \cdot \mathbf{Q} \cdot \mathbf{h}_{\mathbf{s}} + \mathbf{W}^{-1} \cdot \mathbf{R} \cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bs}} + \mathbf{W}^{-1} \cdot \mathbf{X} \cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bg}}, \tag{18.76}
$$

and substituting this expression into equation (18.69), we find

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\mathbf{h}_s = \mathbf{P}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{C}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bs}} + \mathbf{P}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{D}\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bg}},}\\ {\mathbf{h}_\mathbf{g} = \mathbf{W}^{-1}\cdot (\mathbf{Q}\cdot \mathbf{P}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{C} + \mathbf{R})\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bs}} + \mathbf{W}^{-1}\cdot (\mathbf{Q}\cdot \mathbf{P}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{X})\cdot \mathbf{e}_{\mathbf{bg}},} \end{array} \tag{18.78}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\mathbf{C} = \mathbf{S} + \mathbf{U}\cdot \mathbf{W}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{R},\qquad \mathbf{D} = \mathbf{V} + \mathbf{U}\cdot \mathbf{W}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{X},}\\ {\mathbf{P} = \mathbf{T} - \mathbf{U}\cdot \mathbf{W}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{Q}.} \end{array} \tag{18.79b}
$$

In terms of total exchange areas, equations (18.63) and (18.64) are rewritten as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{Q_{si} = \epsilon_iA_iE_{bsj} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{S_iS_j} E_{bsj} - \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{S_iG_k} E_{bgk},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,N,}\\ {Q_{gi} = 4\kappa_iV_iE_{bgj} - \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\overline{G_iS_j} E_{bsj} - \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\overline{G_iG_k} E_{bgk},\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,K,} \end{array} \tag{18.81}
$$

which are the same as equations (18.35) and (18.36) (but with modified total exchange areas). Thus, by comparison we find

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\overline{{\mathbf{S}\mathbf{S}}} = \mathbf{P}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{C}\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \overline{{S_{i}S_{j}}} = \sum_{l = 1}^{N}P_{i l}^{-1}C_{l j},}\\ & {\overline{{\mathbf{S}\mathbf{G}}} = \mathbf{P}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{D}\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \overline{{S_{i}G_{k}}} = \sum_{l = 1}^{N}P_{i l}^{-1}D_{l k},}\\ & {\overline{{\mathbf{G}\mathbf{S}}} = \mathbf{W}^{-1}\cdot (\mathbf{Q}\cdot \mathbf{P}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{C} + \mathbf{R}) = \overline{{\mathbf{S}\mathbf{G}}}^{T},}\\ & {\qquad \mathrm{or}\quad \overline{{G_{k}S_{i}}} = \sum_{l = 1}^{K}W_{k l}^{-1}\left(\sum_{m = 1}^{N}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}Q_{l m}P_{m n}^{-1}C_{n i} + R_{l i}\right),}\\ & {\overline{{\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}}} = \mathbf{W}^{-1}\cdot (\mathbf{Q}\cdot \mathbf{P}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{D} + \mathbf{X}),}\\ & {\qquad = \mathrm{or}\quad \overline{{G_{k}G_{i}}} = \sum_{l = 1}^{K}W_{k l}^{-1}\left(\sum_{m = 1}^{N}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}Q_{l m}P_{m n}^{-1}D_{n i} + X_{i l}\right).} \end{array} \tag{18.85}
$$

Setting all emissive powers equal in equations (18.80) and (18.81) shows that equations (18.38) and (18.39) still hold, without replacing absorption coefficient  $\kappa$  by extinction coefficient  $\beta$  on the right- hand side of equation (18.39),

$$
\begin{array}{c c}{{\sum_{j=1}^{N}\overline{{S_{i}S_{j}}}+\sum_{k=1}^{K}\overline{{S_{i}G_{k}}}=\epsilon_{i}A_{i},}}&{{i=1,2,\ldots,N,}}\\ {{\sum_{j=1}^{N}\overline{{G_{i}S_{j}}}+\sum_{k=1}^{K}\overline{{G_{i}G_{k}}}=4\kappa_{i}V_{i},}}&{{i=1,2,\ldots,K.}}\end{array} \tag{18.87}
$$

# Temperature-Dependent Properties

If the absorption and extinction coefficients depend on temperature, then all direct exchange areas also depend on temperature. Thus, if the temperature field is found iteratively, then

the direct exchange areas must be recalculated after every iteration. This requirement, in turn, eliminates the advantages of using total exchange areas. Therefore, for these problems one would, in general, solve equations (18.67) and (18.68) (or some variation) directly. There is, however, one important case for which a set of total exchange areas can be calculated beforehand (and which do not enter the iteration).

For this we shall make the following two assumptions:  $(i)$  the medium does not scatter, and  $(ii)$  the temperature dependence of the average absorption coefficient between two zones,  $\kappa_{ij}$ , may be neglected (or is only updated after a given number of iterations for the temperature field). With these assumptions we may write

$$
\overline{{s_{i}s_{j}}} = (\overline{{s_{i}s_{j}}})_{\mathrm{av}},\quad \overline{{s_{i}g_{j}}} = \overline{{g_{j}s_{i}}} = (\overline{{s_{i}g_{j}}})_{\mathrm{av}}\frac{\kappa_{j}}{\kappa_{\mathrm{av}}},\quad \overline{{g_{i}g_{j}}} = (\overline{{g_{i}g_{j}}})_{\mathrm{av}}\frac{\kappa_{i}\kappa_{j}}{\kappa_{\mathrm{av}}^{2}}, \tag{18.88}
$$

where  $(\overline{s_i s_j})_{\mathrm{av}}$ , etc., are direct exchange areas evaluated from equations (18.57), (18.61), and (18.62), with  $\beta_{i}$  and  $\beta_{j}$  (or  $\kappa_{i}$  and  $\kappa_{j}$  for a nonscattering medium) replaced by an average absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{\mathrm{av}}$ . The assumption of a temperature- independent  $\kappa_{ij}$  thus implies that the average direct exchange areas do not depend on temperature. Substituting equation (18.88) into (18.45), and realizing that neither  $\mathbf{T}$  nor  $\mathbf{S}$  depends on temperature, we find

$$
\overline{{S_{i}S_{j}}} = \sum_{l = 1}^{N}(T^{-1})_{il}S_{lj} = \left(\overline{{S_{i}S_{j}}}\right)_{\mathrm{av}}, \tag{18.89}
$$

that is, the  $\overline{S_iS_j}$  do not depend on temperature either. From equation (18.46)

$$
\overline{S_iG_k} = \sum_{l = 1}^{N}(T^{-1})_{il}\left(\overline{s_i g_k}\right)_{\mathrm{av}}\frac{\kappa_k}{\kappa_{\mathrm{av}}} = \left(\overline{S_i G_k}\right)_{\mathrm{av}}\frac{\kappa_k}{\kappa_{\mathrm{av}}}, \tag{18.90}
$$

that is, the  $(\overline{\mathbf{SG}})_{\mathrm{av}}$  may be calculated once and for all, and the actual  $\overline{\mathbf{SG}}$  are found by a simple multiplication. Similarly, from equation (18.51),

$$
\overline{G_iG_k} = \left[\left(\overline{g_i g_k}\right)_{\mathrm{av}} + \sum_{l = 1}^{N}\frac{(\overline{g_i s_i})_{\mathrm{av}}}{A_l}\frac{\rho_l}{\epsilon_l}\left(\overline{S_i G_k}\right)_{\mathrm{av}}\right]\frac{\kappa_l\kappa_k}{\kappa_{\mathrm{av}}^2} = \left(\overline{G_i G_k}\right)_{\mathrm{av}}\frac{\kappa_l\kappa_k}{\kappa_{\mathrm{av}}^2}. \tag{18.91}
$$

Equations (18.35) and (18.36) may then be rewritten in terms of average total exchange areas.

Example 18.3. Repeat Example 18.2 for a medium that not only emits and absorbs, but that also scatters isotropically.

# Solution

We shall still limit ourselves to a single gas zone even though this will no longer render the analysis exact: For that, the radiative source term,  $4(1 - \omega)E_{b} + \omega G$ , must be constant across the volume zone.

It follows immediately that the direct exchange areas remain unchanged (except that  $\tau_{L} = \beta L$  is now based on the extinction coefficient). From equations (18.80) and (18.86) it follows that the nondimensional heat flux at the surface is still evaluated as

$$
\Psi = \frac{q_w}{\sigma(T_w^4 - T_m^4)} = \widetilde{SG},
$$

and that only the evaluation of  $\widetilde{SG}$  from the direct exchange areas is different from the previous example. While the tensors  $\mathbf{T}$  and  $\mathbf{Q}$  remain unchanged, we still need to evaluate  $\mathbf{U},\mathbf{V},\mathbf{W}$ , and  $\mathbf{X}$  for the evaluation of  $\widetilde{SG}$ . Thus,

$$
\mathbf{U} = \frac{\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g}\omega}{4\tau_{\scriptscriptstyle L}(1 - \omega)}\left( \begin{array}{l}1\\ 1 \end{array} \right);\qquad \mathbf{V} = \widetilde{s}\widetilde{g} (1 - \omega)\left( \begin{array}{l}1\\ 1 \end{array} \right);
$$

$$
\mathbf{W} = \left(\frac{4\tau_{L} - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}}{4\tau_{L}(1 - \omega)}\right);\qquad \mathbf{X} = \left(\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g} (1 - \omega)\right);
$$

where  $\mathbf{W}$  and  $\mathbf{X}$  are single- term  $1\times 1$  matrices. Thus,

$$
\mathbf{W}^{-1} = (1 / W)\quad \mathrm{and}\quad D_{ij} = V_{ij} + \sum_{k = 1}^{1}\sum_{l = 1}^{1}U_{ik}W_{kl}^{-1}X_{lj},
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{D} = \left[\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g} (1 - \omega) + \frac{\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g}\omega}{4\tau_{L}(1 - \omega)}\times \frac{4\tau_{L}(1 - \omega)}{4\tau_{L} - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}}\times \widetilde{g}\widetilde{g} (1 - \omega)\right]\left( \begin{array}{c}1\\ 1\\ 1 \end{array} \right) = \frac{4\tau_{L}(1 - \omega)\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g}}{4\tau_{L} - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}}\left( \begin{array}{c}1\\ 1\\ 1 \end{array} \right).
$$

Similarly,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{P_{ij} = T_{ij} - \frac{U_{i1}Q_{1j}}{W} = T_{ij} - \frac{\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g}\omega}{4\tau_L(1 - \omega)}\times \frac{4\tau_L(1 - \omega)}{4\tau_L - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}}\times \frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g}}\\ {= T_{ij} - \frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\frac{\omega(\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g})^2}{4\tau_{L} - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}},} \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\mathbf{P} = \left( \begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{\epsilon} -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\frac{\omega(\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g})^2}{4\tau_L - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}} & -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\left[\widetilde{s_1s_2} +\frac{\omega(\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g})^2}{4\tau_L - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}}\right]\\ -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\left[\widetilde{s_1s_2} +\frac{\omega(\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g})^2}{4\tau_L - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}}\right] & \frac{1}{\epsilon} -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\frac{\omega(\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g})^2}{4\tau_L - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}} \end{array} \right),
$$

$$
\mathbf{P}^{-1} = \frac{1}{P}\left( \begin{array}{cc}\frac{1}{\epsilon} -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\frac{\omega(\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g})^2}{4\tau_L - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}} & \frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\left[\widetilde{s_1s_2} +\frac{\omega(\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g})^2}{4\tau_L - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}}\right]\\ \frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\left[\widetilde{s_1s_2} +\frac{\omega(\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g})^2}{4\tau_L - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}}\right] & \frac{1}{\epsilon} -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon}\frac{\omega(\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g})^2}{4t_L - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}} \end{array} \right)
$$

and

$$
\begin{array}{l}{P = P_{11}^{2} - P_{12}^{2} = \frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}\bigg[1 - 2\rho \frac{\omega(\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g})^{2}}{4\tau_{L} - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}} -\rho^{2}(\widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}})^{2} - 2\rho^{2}\widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}}\frac{\omega(\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g})^{2}}{4\tau_{L} - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}}\bigg]}\\ {= \frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}\bigg[1 - (\rho \widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}})^{2} - 2\rho (1 + \rho \widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}})\frac{\omega(\widetilde{s}\widetilde{g})^{2}}{4\tau_{L} - \omega\widetilde{g}\widetilde{g}}\bigg].} \end{array}
$$

Finally,

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\widetilde{\mathbf{S}}\widetilde{\mathbf{G}} = \mathbf{P}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{D} = \left( \begin{array}{l}{P_{11}^{-1}D_{11} + P_{12}^{-1}D_{21}}\\ {P_{21}^{-1}D_{11} + P_{22}^{-1}D_{21}} \end{array} \right)}\\ & {\quad = \epsilon \frac{(1 + \rho\widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}})4\tau_{L}(1 - \omega)\widetilde{s g} / (4\tau_{L} - \omega\widetilde{g g})}{1 - (\rho\widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}})^{2} - 2\rho(1 + \rho\widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}})\frac{\omega(\widetilde{s g})^{2}}{4\tau_{L} - \omega\widetilde{g g}}}\left( \begin{array}{l}{1}\\ {1}\\ {1} \end{array} \right)}\\ & {\quad = \frac{4\tau_{L}(1 - \omega)\epsilon\widetilde{s g}}{(1 - \rho\widetilde{s_{1}s_{2}})(4\tau_{L} - \omega\widetilde{g g}) - 2\rho\omega(\widetilde{s g})^{2}}\left( \begin{array}{l}{1}\\ {1}\\ {1} \end{array} \right).} \end{array}
$$

Substituting for  $\widetilde{s_1s_2}, \widetilde{s_2}$ , and  $\widetilde{g g}$ , which have already been evaluated in Example 18.2 (although  $\tau_L$  is now based on the extinction coefficient), this reduces to

$$
\Psi = \frac{q_w}{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)} = \widetilde{S}\widetilde{G} = \frac{\epsilon[1 - 2E_3(\tau_L)]}{1 - 2\rho E_3(\tau_L) + \frac{2\epsilon\omega}{4\tau_L(1 - \omega)}[1 - 2E_3(\tau_L)]}.
$$

The zonal method has been applied to gray, isotropically scattering media by a number of researchers. For example, Naraghi and Kassemi [16] treated the same problem of a rectangular medium at radiative equilibrium as Modest [14], but included isotropic scattering. They also applied the method to combined free convection- radiation problems [17, 18].

A different approach than described here for the evaluation of total exchange areas was taken by Vercammen and Froment [19], who used the Monte Carlo method with subsequent data smoothing (to eliminate statistical scatter).7 A similar approach was also taken by Naraghi and Chung [20]. Naraghi and Chung also presented what they called a "unified matrix approach" by combining equations (18.69) and (18.70) into a single matrix equation,

$$
\left( \begin{array}{cc}\mathbf{T} & -\mathbf{U}\\ -\mathbf{Q} & \mathbf{W} \end{array} \right)\cdot \left( \begin{array}{c}\mathbf{h}_{\mathrm{s}}\\ \mathbf{h}_{\mathrm{g}} \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array}{cc}\mathbf{S} & \mathbf{V}\\ \mathbf{R} & \mathbf{X} \end{array} \right)\cdot \left( \begin{array}{c}\mathbf{e}_{\mathrm{bs}}\\ \mathbf{e}_{\mathrm{bg}} \end{array} \right), \tag{18.92}
$$

which may be inverted to give

$$
\left(\frac{\overline{\mathbf{S}\overline{\mathbf{S}}}}{\overline{\mathbf{G}\overline{\mathbf{S}}}}\right) = \left( \begin{array}{cc}\mathbf{T} & -\mathbf{U}\\ -\mathbf{Q} & \mathbf{W} \end{array} \right)^{-1}\cdot \left( \begin{array}{cc}\mathbf{S} & \mathbf{V}\\ \mathbf{R} & \mathbf{X} \end{array} \right). \tag{18.93}
$$

It is not clear whether this approach will result in increased computer efficiency, since here a single  $(N + K)\times (N + K)$  matrix must be inverted while, in the standard method, two matrices must be inverted (one  $N\times N$  and the other  $K\times K$  -

In principle, the zonal method can also be applied to media that scatter anisotropically (and/or have nondiffuse bounding surfaces). This was shown by Yuen and Takara [11] (and Ma [12] for a one- dimensional slab). However, this requires converting (surface and/or volume) radiosities into vectors [i.e., exchange between any two zones, leading to  $(N + K)^2$  unknowns and simultaneous equations and, thus, an unacceptable increase in computer storage and time].

# 18.5 RADIATIVE EXCHANGE THROUGH A NONGRAY MEDIUM

In the foregoing discussion we have assumed that the medium and the surfaces are gray, although all equations in this chapter up to this point are equally valid, on a spectral basis, for a nongray enclosure with a nongray medium. Unfortunately, the zonal method- - like many other solution methods for radiative transfer problems- - is not well suited for nongray media. However, Hottel and coworkers [1, 2, 21] have demonstrated that the zonal method may be applied to a nongray medium in one very special, but very important, case: an absorbing, emitting (but not scattering) medium confined in a black- walled enclosure. This important situation is often encountered in furnace applications where mixtures of combustion gases and soot are confined by furnace refractories blackened by soot.

In this method, known as the weighted- sum- of- gray- gases method, the medium is assumed to consist of different fractions of gray gases with different (but gray) absorption coefficients.8 The "gas" can also be a semitransparent liquid: Yin and Jaluria [22, 23] modeled the absorption coefficient of glass to consist of one transparent and two gray bands.

# Surface-Surface Exchange

From equation (18.26) it follows that the radiative heat flux leaving  $dA_{i}$  and arriving at  $dA_{j}$  is

$$
Q_{i\rightarrow j} = \int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{A_i}\int_{A_j}e^{-\kappa_iS}\frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{\pi S^2} dA_jdA_iJ_{\nu i}d\nu , \tag{18.94}
$$

where, for simplicity, it is assumed that the spectral absorption coefficient,  $\kappa_{\nu}$ , does not depend on temperature or location. For a black enclosure  $J_{\nu} = E_{b\nu}$ , and equation (18.94) may be integrated over the entire spectrum by using the definition for medium emissivity, equation (11.171),

$$
\epsilon_{m}(T,S) = \frac{1}{\sigma T^{4}}\int_{0}^{\infty}(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\nu}S})E_{b\nu}(T)d\nu , \tag{18.95}
$$

leading to

$$
Q_{i\rightarrow j} = \int_{A_i}\int_{A_j}[1 - \epsilon_m(T_i,S)]\frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{\pi S^2} dA_jdA_iE_{bi} = \overleftrightarrow{s_iS_j} E_{bi}. \tag{18.96}
$$

Similarly, we have

$$
Q_{j\rightarrow i} = \int_{A_i}\int_{A_j}\left[1 - \epsilon_m(T_j,S)\right]\frac{\cos\theta_i\cos\theta_j}{\pi S^2} dA_jdA_iE_{bj} = \overleftrightarrow{s_iS_j} E_{bj}. \tag{18.97}
$$

Both exchange areas now have arrows, rather than bars, since they are no longer equal, but depend on the temperature of the emitting surface, or

$$
Q_{i\leftrightarrow j} = \overleftrightarrow{s_iS_j} E_{bi} - \overleftrightarrow{s_iS_j} E_{bj}. \tag{18.98}
$$

Hotel [21] has shown that the emissivity of the medium may be written in the form

$$
\epsilon_{m}(T,S)\simeq \sum_{l = 0}^{L}a_{l}(T)\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{l}S}\right),\quad \sum_{l = 0}^{L}a_{l} = 1, \tag{18.99}
$$

where  $l = 0$  with  $\kappa_0 = 0$  has been included for the case in which the medium consists entirely of molecular gases with large windows between bands. Experience has shown that  $L = 3$  usually gives sufficiently accurate results, and even  $L = 1$  (gray plus clear gas) often suffices [2]. Using this "weighted- sum- of- gray- gases" we have

$$
Q_{i\leftrightarrow j}\simeq \sum_{l = 0}^{L}(\overleftrightarrow{s_iS_j})_l\left[a_l(T_i)E_{bi} - a_l(T_j)E_{bj}\right], \tag{18.100}
$$

where  $(\overline{s_iS_j})_l$  is  $\overline{s_iS_j}$  evaluated for an absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{l}$ . Thus, the solution for the nongray medium is identical to that for a gray medium, except that emissive power is replaced by a weighted emissive power, and the calculations have to be carried out for a number of gray gases.

# Surface-Volume Exchange

Similarly, from equation (18.27) it follows that, for a black enclosure,

$$
\begin{array}{r l}{Q_{i\rightarrow j} =} & {\int_{0}^{\infty}\int_{V_{i}}\int_{A_{j}}\frac{\cos\theta_{j}}{\pi S^{2}}\kappa_{\nu}e^{-\kappa_{\nu}S}d A_{j}d V_{i}E_{b\nu i}d\nu}\\ = & {\int_{V_{i}}\int_{A_{j}}\frac{\cos\theta_{j}}{\pi S^{2}}\frac{d}{d S}\left[\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\nu}S}\right)E_{b\nu i}d\nu \right]d A_{j}d V_{i}}\\ = & {\int_{V_{i}}\int_{A_{j}}\frac{d\epsilon_{m}}{d S} (T_{i},S)\frac{\cos\theta_{j}}{\pi S^{2}} d A_{j}d V_{i}E_{b i} = \overrightarrow{g_{i}S_{j}} E_{b i}.} \end{array} \tag{18.101}
$$

Note that  $E_{bi}$  can be pulled inside the operator  $d / dS$ , since it is assumed constant over  $V_{i}$ . Therefore, using equation (18.99), we find

$$
Q_{i\leftrightarrow j} = \overrightarrow{g_{i}s_{j}} E_{bi} - \overleftarrow{g_{i}s_{j}} E_{bj}\simeq \sum_{l = 1}^{L}(\overrightarrow{g_{i}s_{j}})_{l}\left[a_{l}(T_{i})E_{bi} - a_{l}(T_{j})E_{bj}\right], \tag{18.102}
$$

where the summation starts with  $l = 1$  since there is no emission within the medium for  $\kappa_0 = 0$ .

# Volume-Volume Exchange

By the same reasoning equation (18.28) becomes

$$
\begin{array}{l}{Q_{i\rightarrow j} = \int_0^\infty \int_{V_i}\int_{V_j}\frac{1}{\pi S^2}\kappa_i^2 e^{-\kappa_iS}dV_jdV_iE_{b\nu i}d\nu}\\ {= -\int_{V_i}\int_{V_j}\frac{d^2\epsilon_m}{dS^2} (T_i,S)\frac{1}{\pi S^2} dV_jdV_iE_{bi} = \overrightarrow{g_ig_j} E_{bi},} \end{array} \tag{18.103}
$$

and

$$
Q_{i\leftrightarrow j} = \overrightarrow{g_{i}}\overrightarrow{g_{j}} E_{bi} - \overleftarrow{g_{i}}\overrightarrow{g_{j}} E_{bj}\simeq \sum_{l = 1}^{L}\left(\overrightarrow{g_{i}}\overrightarrow{g_{j}}\right)_{l}\left[a_{l}(T_{i})E_{bi} - a_{l}(T_{j})E_{bj}\right]. \tag{18.104}
$$

Therefore, the net heat flow between any two surface or volume zones is calculated by determining the heat fluxes for a number of enclosures filled with a gray gas and with weighted emissive powers, followed by adding these heat fluxes.

Note that the approximation of equation (18.99) is not necessary: The directional direct exchange areas may be evaluated in terms of the total emissivity  $\epsilon_{m}(T,S)$ , leading to more accurate results. The approximation is made for convenience, reducing the problem to the simpler gray case with somewhat less involved evaluations of the direct exchange areas. The major advantage of the weighted- sum- of- gray- gases method is that the direct exchange areas  $(\overline{s_i s_j})_l, (\overline{s_i} \overline{g_k})_l$ , and  $(\overline{g_i} \overline{g_k})_l$  do not depend on temperature and, therefore,  $(i)$  may be looked up in tables and graphs such as the ones given by [2] (this fact was of major importance during the method's early days, when fast computers were not yet available), and  $(ii)$  do not have to be recalculated, if the temperature field is found by iteration.

While equations (18.100) or (18.98), (18.102), and (18.104) are strictly valid only for black enclosures without scattering, a case can be made to extend this to reflecting surfaces and to scattering media: The difference in direct and total exchange areas is due to the average total vs. direct distance traveled between zones  $i$  and  $j$ . Since  $S$  does not appear directly in these equations<sup>10</sup> we may assume that, approximately, they are also valid for total exchange areas,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\overrightarrow{S_iS_jE_{bi}} -\overrightarrow{S_iS_jE_{bj}}\simeq \sum_{l = 0}^{L}\left(\overrightarrow{S_iS_j}\right)_l\left[a_l(T_i)E_{bi} - a_l(T_j)E_{bj}\right],}\\ {\overrightarrow{G_iS_jE_{bi}} -\overleftarrow{G_iS_jE_{bj}}\simeq \sum_{l = 1}^{L}\left(\overrightarrow{G_iS_j}\right)_l\left[a_l(T_i)E_{bi} - a_l(T_j)E_{bj}\right],}\\ {\overrightarrow{G_iG_jE_{bi}} -\overleftarrow{G_iG_jE_{bj}}\simeq \sum_{l = 1}^{L}\left(\overrightarrow{G_iG_j}\right)_l\left[a_l(T_i)E_{bi} - a_l(T_j)E_{bj}\right],} \end{array} \tag{18.105}
$$

and equations (18.80) and (18.81) may be used to determine net heat fluxes.

Considerable work has appeared in the literature dealing with the nongray zonal method. Nelson [24] pointed out that the use of equation (18.99) is not necessary, except for numerical efficiency for iterative calculations. He also proposed an approximation to apply the zonal method to reflecting boundaries. Correlations of the type of equation (18.99) have been determined for  $\mathrm{CO_2 - H_2O}$  gas mixtures by Smith and coworkers [25]. They later applied the weighted- sum- of- gray- gases model to combined radiative and convective heat transfer in a pipe [26]. A similar problem was addressed by Sistino [27].

# 18.6 DETERMINATION OF DIRECT EXCHANGE AREAS

The use of equations (18.63) and (18.64) together with the definition of direct exchange areas, or equations (18.80) and (18.81) together with the definition of total exchange areas, demands that the variation of the radiosity must be neglected over each surface zone, and that the variation of the radiation source term must be neglected over each volume zone. Hottel and Sarofim [2] state that, if  $5\%$  accuracy in the calculation of heat fluxes is to be assured, the zone sizes should be such that no zone has an optical depth (extinction coefficient  $\times$  largest dimension of zone over which radiosity or source varies) exceeding the value of 0.4.

Accuracy of the zonal method may be improved in two ways: (i) increasing the number of zones, and  $(ii)$  increasing the accuracy of the numerical quadrature used to determine individual direct exchange areas. Increasing the number of zones allows the use of simple efficient techniques for the evaluation of exchange areas, but requires the time- consuming inversion of a large matrix. Modest [14, 15] found that, for sufficiently many zones, all exchange areas but one may be calculated by evaluating the integrand between zonal centers, multiplied by the applicable zonal areas and/or volumes. The error made for the closest zones is then offset by applying equations (18.65) and (18.66) for the last one  $\overline{g_{i}g_{j}}$  for volume- volume areas, common- face  $\overline{g_{i}s_{j}}$  for volume- surface areas, and common- boundary  $\overline{s_{i}s_{j}}$  for a corner zone). This finite- difference version of the zonal method has been generalized and refined by Naraghi and coworkers [28,29].

Using relatively few zones with accurately evaluated exchange areas, on the other hand, requires only the inversion of a small matrix. But the numerical quadrature for the evaluation of exchange areas becomes time- consuming since many internal nodal points will be required. Still, if the temperature field is to be determined by iteration, considerable computer time may be saved since the evaluation of exchange areas does not enter the iteration. Accuracy for the zonal method with relatively few zones may be increased by allowing the emissive power to vary across a zone. Walther and coworkers [3] have shown for one- dimensional plane- parallel slab zones that a linear emissive power variation across the slab can be incorporated in a rigorous fashion. For two- dimensional rectangular volume zones Einstein [4,5] included linear emissive power variations in a semirigorous manner (for two- dimensional Cartesian and cylindrical geometries).

# Problems

18.1 For a one- dimensional problem of a gas medium confined between two parallel plates, determine the direct exchange factor  $\widetilde{g_i g_j}$  (i.e., per unit area), where medium zone  $i$  is an infinitely large slab of thickness  $\Delta z$  (located between  $z_i \leq z \leq z_i + \Delta z$ ), and  $j$  is another medium zone (located at  $z_j \leq z \leq z_j + \Delta z$ ).

18.2 For a two- dimensional problem determine the direct exchange factor  $\overline{g_i g_j'}$  (i.e., per unit length) between two infinitely long volume zones of constant rectangular cross- section, as shown in Fig. 18- 3a (the zones are infinitely long in the direction normal to the figure). You may assume that the zones

are sufficiently far apart so that  $S \simeq$  const across the cross- section of the zones. In a similar fashion determine  $\overline{g_{i}s_{i}'}$  and  $\overline{s_{m}s_{i}'}$ .

$$

where  $\omega$  is the band width parameter, and  $E_{b\eta 0}$  is the spectral emissive power at the band center.

The following problems are considerably more involved and require the development of a small computer program.

18.6 Consider a rectangular enclosure of width  $W = 1\mathrm{m}$  and height  $H = 20\mathrm{cm}$  (and infinite length, without any dependence on that direction).

The other three walls are at  $T_{2} = T_{3} = T_{4} = 400\mathrm{K}$ ,  $\epsilon_{2} = \epsilon_{3} = \epsilon_{4} = 0.5$ . There is no participating medium in the enclosure. Break up the enclosure surfaces into zones of  $4\mathrm{cm}$  width, and calculate the local heat transfer rates by the zonal method with total exchange areas.

18.11 Consider a one- dimensional problem such as Problem 18.1. The plates are a distance  $L = 1\mathrm{m}$  apart, the bottom plate is at  $T_{1} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  with emittance  $\epsilon_{1} = 0.5$ , and the top plate is at  $T_{2} = 300\mathrm{K}$  and  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.5$ . The medium between the plates is isothermal at  $T_{m} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  and has an absorption coefficient of

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \kappa_{0}e^{-2|\eta -\eta_{0}| / \omega},\quad \kappa_{0} = 10\mathrm{cm}^{-1},\quad \eta_{0} = 3000\mathrm{cm}^{-1},\quad \omega = 200\mathrm{cm}^{-1}

# COLLIMATED IRRADIATION AND TRANSIENT PHENOMENA

# 19.1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the analysis of radiative transfer in multidimensional absorbing, emitting, and scattering media with collimated irradiation. By collimated irradiation we mean external radiation that penetrates from the outside into a participating medium (as opposed to emission from a bounding surface), with all light waves being parallel to one another (or approximately so). Typical examples include solar radiation through the atmosphere and into the ocean, laser irradiation of particles or liquids, and so on. With the advent of short- pulsed lasers with pulse durations measured in pico- or even femtoseconds, transient radiation effects have also become of interest. Since, in engineering applications, virtually all transient radiation effects are due to short- pulsed lasers, these two topics are treated jointly in the present chapter. By collimated irradiation we mean that the intensity incident on a surface  $dA$  at location  $\mathbf{r}_w$  on the bounding surface of the medium, as shown in Fig. 19- 1, may be written as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I_{ow}(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = q_o(\mathbf{r}_w)\delta [\hat{\mathbf{s}} -\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o(\mathbf{r}_w)]}\\ {= q_o(\mathbf{r}_w)\delta [\mu -\mu_o(\mathbf{r}_w)]\delta [\psi -\psi_o(\mathbf{r}_w)],} \end{array} \tag{19.1}
$$

where  $\delta$  is the Dirac- delta function, which is here defined as<sup>1</sup>

$$
\delta (x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}0, & |x| > \epsilon ,\\ \lim_{\epsilon \to 0}\frac{1}{2\epsilon}, & |x|< \epsilon , \end{array} \right. \tag{19.2a}
$$

$$
\int_{4\pi}f(\hat{\mathbf{s}})\delta (\hat{\mathbf{s}} -\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o)d\Omega = \int_0^{2\pi}\int_{-1}^{+1}f(\mu ,\psi)\delta (\mu -\mu_o)\delta (\psi -\psi_o)d\mu d\psi = f(\mu_o,\psi_o), \tag{19.2b}
$$

and

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o = \cos \theta_o\hat{\mathbf{n}} +\sin \theta_o(\cos \psi_o\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1 + \sin \psi_o\hat{\mathbf{t}}_2),\qquad \mu_o = \cos \theta_o, \tag{19.3}
$$

is the direction from which the collimated radiation impinges onto the medium (with  $\hat{\mathbf{n}}$  the surface normal pointing into the medium and  $\hat{\mathbf{t}}_1$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{t}}_2$  two orthogonal unit vectors lying on the

![](images/6596dd9b557a407e13c4fff51f90e74da86ee888219a188595b7343c22b027f7.jpg)  
FIGURE 19-1 Collimated irradiation impinging on an arbitrary surface: (a) solar irradiation, (b) laser irradiation.

boundary surface). Equation (19.1) implies that the incident intensity is zero for all directions except for  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o$ , where it is infinitely large. The total heat flux within the collimated irradiation is determined from

$$
\mathbf{q}_o = \int_{4\pi}I_{ow}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = q_o\int_{4\pi}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\delta (\hat{\mathbf{s}} -\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o)d\Omega = q_o\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o, \tag{19.4}
$$

that is,  $q_{o}$  is the total radiative heat flux of the collimated irradiation through a surface normal to the rays. The component penetrating into the medium is then

$$
\mathbf{q}_c = \left[1 - \rho (\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o)\right]q_o\hat{\mathbf{s}}_c, \tag{19.5}
$$

where  $\rho$  is the reflectance of the interface in the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o$ . Since the irradiation penetrating into the medium may be refracted, the unit direction vector inside the medium is denoted as  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_c$ , which may be different from  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o$ . As indicated in the above expressions the magnitude of the irradiation  $q_{o}$ , as well as the direction of irradiation,  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o$ , may vary over the surface of the enclosure, while the reflectance of the surface may vary with position and direction.

In a strictly mathematical sense equation (19.1) introduces nothing new: Collimated irradiation could simply be treated as "strongly directional emission." However, the discontinuity of intensity with direction causes problems with analytical as well as numerical solution techniques, thus warranting a separate approach for this type of problem.

Most earlier works on collimated radiation dealt with solar radiation and other atmospheric or astrophysical applications. They are, therefore, generally limited to one- dimensional cases with uniform irradiation of a planar medium. For this simple case, some exact and approximate solutions have been given by Irvine [1], who used the Henyey- Greenstein phase function, a scattering phase function that adequately approximates the anisotropic scattering behavior of a large number of media [2], as given by equation (12.95). The identical problem for Rayleigh scattering was treated by Kubo [3] without, however, reporting any results. Armaly and El- Baz [4] found some approximate solutions for isotropic scattering in a finite- thickness slab using the kernel approximation. Their application was in the area of solar collectors. A similar problem was treated by Houf and Incropera [5], who investigated different approximate techniques for solar irradiation of aqueous media.

Only with the advent of the laser as a research and manufacturing tool has nonsolar collimated radiation received some research attention. Smith [6] investigated the case of a uniform strip of collimated radiation incident on a semi- infinite medium. The resulting two- dimensional

integral equation was reduced to one- dimensional form using Fourier transforms. Hunt [7] investigated the effect of a cylindrical collimated beam impinging upon a finite layer. A solution was found for the basic case of Bessel- function varying intensity using Green's functions. The first ones to apply this theory to laser radiation appear to be Beckett and coworkers [8], who investigated numerically the effect of a cylindrical beam with Gaussian variation penetrating through a finite layer. They showed how a diagnostic laser beam can be used to deduce radiative properties of an optically thick slab, such as single- scattering albedo, extinction, and absorption coefficients. Finally, a number of papers by Crosbie and coworkers [9- 12] dealt with exact solutions to the general two- dimensional problem of collimated radiation impinging onto an absorbing- scattering layer. First, they treated collimated strip sources irradiating a semi- infinite body [9]; later, they discussed cylindrical beams falling on a semi- infinite body [10, 11]. Collimated irradiation onto a rectangular medium was investigated by Crosbie and Schrenker [12] for isotropic scattering, while Kim and Lee [13] demonstrated the accuracy of the high- order discrete ordinates method by applying it to the same problem with anisotropic scattering. The exact solutions may be used as benchmarks for evaluation of approximate methods and may be necessary in cases where the requirement for highly accurate results justifies going through the trouble usually associated with these methods. In the area of heat transfer, however, approximate solutions often result in acceptable predictions for most practical situations.

Recently, some more advanced problems have also become of interest. Tan and coworkers considered combined conduction and radiative laser heating of glass [14], while Lacroix and colleagues [15] and Xu and Song [16, 17] applied the discrete ordinates method to analyze the interaction of a laser beam with the plume or plasma generated by the laser. El Ammouri et al. [18] showed how laser beam fluctuations, caused by temperature fluctuations, can be employed as a tool to measure turbulence levels. Along the same line Ben- Abdallah [19] and coworkers analyzed the curved beam path that a laser traverses in a gas with varying refractive index.

Lasers with ultra- short pulse lengths are utilized heavily in the emerging field of nanotechnology and also in biomedical engineering [20]. The radiative fields generated by such short- pulsed lasers may differ from those discussed in this book in two important aspects: (1) since light travels only  $300\mu \mathrm{m}$  during a time span of 1 ps, transient effects must be accounted for, and (2) packing a fixed amount of energy into a pulse of extremely short duration leads to temporally extreme intensities. The former requires consideration of the transient term in the RTE, equation (10.20), and has been investigated by a number of researchers [21- 32]. At very high intensities, many molecules are promoted to excited levels, which have different absorption behavior, making the absorption coefficient a function of intensity; this is known as saturable absorption [33]. Depending on the relative magnitude of absorption cross- sections, this may lead to bleaching (absorption coefficient decreases with intensity) or darkening (absorption coefficient increases with intensity) [34]. In addition, at very high intensities molecules may absorb more than a single photon at the same time, raising the molecule to an excited electronic state. This is known as multiphoton absorption [35- 37]. If the total absorbed photon energy is high enough this, in turn, may lead to ionization or dissociation, which is known as photolysis. Several photochemical and photothermal models have been developed to describe short- pulse laser ablation of materials [38- 41]. In biomedical engineering short- pulsed lasers are seen as promising tools for optical imaging (of tumors, etc.) [24, 42, 43] and for minimally invasive surgery (such as ablation of tumors) [44].

In this chapter we shall describe how problems involving radiative transfer in an absorbing, emitting, and anisotropically scattering medium of arbitrary geometry exposed to arbitrary collimated irradiation are dealt with by separating the collimated radiation (as it travels through the medium) from the rest of the radiation field. The problem is thus reduced to one without

collimated irradiation, but with a modified radiation source term (now including a source due to the scattered part of the collimated irradiation). We shall see that it is possible to incorporate collimated irradiation readily into well- known approximate methods such as the  $P_{1}$ - approximation. Because of its emerging importance, the chapter also includes a very brief section on transient effects during short- pulsed laser irradiation.

# 19.2 REDUCTION OF THE PROBLEM

The equation of transfer for an absorbing, emitting, and anisotropically scattering medium is given by equation (10.18) as

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \kappa I_b(\mathbf{r}) - \beta I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + \frac{\sigma_s}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}')\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}},\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')d\Omega '. \tag{19.6}
$$

As usual, the lack of a spectral subscript implies that we deal either with spectral intensity or with a gray medium. We shall limit ourselves here to media with diffusely emitting and reflecting boundaries. Then the boundary condition for equation (19.6) is, for any location  $\mathbf{r}_w$  on the surface,

$$
I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = [1 - \rho (\mathbf{r}_w)]I_{dw}(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + \epsilon (\mathbf{r}_w)I_{bw}(\mathbf{r}_w) + \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}_w)}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '\cdot < 0}I(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')\left|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} '\right|d\Omega '. \tag{19.7}
$$

Here the first term on the right- hand side represents penetration of collimated radiation, the second term describes emission from the surrounding medium, and the last term is due to diffuse reflection at the interface. This distribution is shown schematically in Fig. 19- 2a. Since we assume here diffuse emission and reflection and are looking at spectral relations or a gray medium, we also have  $\epsilon = 1 - \rho$

We now separate the intensity within the medium into two parts:  $(i)$  the remnant of the collimated beam after partial extinction, by absorption and scattering, along its path, and  $(ii)$  a fairly diffuse part, which is the result of emission from the boundaries, emission from within the medium, and the radiation scattered away from the collimated irradiation. Thus, we set

$$
I(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_c(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + I_d(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}), \tag{19.8}
$$

where the collimated remnant of the irradiation obeys the equation of transfer

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla I_c(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = -\beta I_c(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}), \tag{19.9}
$$

subject to the boundary condition

$$
I_{c}(\mathbf{r}_{w},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = [1 - \rho (\mathbf{r}_{w})]q_{o}(\mathbf{r}_{w})\delta [\hat{\mathbf{s}} -\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{c}(\mathbf{r}_{w})]. \tag{19.10}
$$

Equations (19.9) and (19.10) are readily solved as

$$
I_{c}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = [1 - \rho (\mathbf{r}_{w})]q_{o}(\mathbf{r}_{w})\delta [\hat{\mathbf{s}} -\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{c}(\mathbf{r}_{w})]e^{-\tau_{c}}, \tag{19.11}
$$

where  $\tau_{c} = \int_{0}^{s}\beta ds^{\prime}$  and  $s = |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_w|$  as indicated in Fig. 19- 2b. Substituting equations (19.8) and (19.9) into equation (19.6) gives the equation of transfer for the noncollimated radiation as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\frac{1}{\beta}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla I_d(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla_\tau I_d(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = -I_d(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_d(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}')\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}},\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')d\Omega '\\ +(1 - \omega)I_b(\mathbf{r}) + \omega S_c(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}), \end{array} \tag{19.12}
$$

![](images/3e341545599898c160f4516c2a13a565dd5a70cfb432ed2d14e7fe538864e71b.jpg)  
FIGURE 19-2 Radiative intensity at the surface of an enclosure with collimated irradiation: (a) outgoing intensity, (b) incoming intensity.

where the abbreviation

$$
S_{c}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\equiv \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{c}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}},\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})d\Omega^{\prime} = \frac{1}{4\pi}\left[1 - \rho (\mathbf{r}_{w})\right]q_{o}(\mathbf{r}_{w})e^{-\tau_{c}}\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{c}) \tag{19.13}
$$

has been introduced and  $\nabla_{c}$  again implies that the gradient is to be taken with respect to nondimensional optical coordinates. Thus,  $S_{c}$  is a radiative source term resulting from radiation scattered away from the collimated beam; it behaves similarly to  $I_{b}$ , although this "emission" may not be isotropic (in the case of anisotropic scattering). Similarly, substituting equations (19.8) and (19.10) into equation (19.7) gives the boundary condition for equation (19.12) as

$$
I_{d}(\mathbf{r}_{w},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \epsilon I_{bw}(\mathbf{r}_{w}) + \frac{\rho(\mathbf{r}_{w})}{\pi}\bigg[H_{c}(\mathbf{r}_{w}) + \int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}< 0}I_{d}(\mathbf{r}_{w},\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}|d\Omega^{\prime}\bigg], \tag{19.14}
$$

where

$$
H_{c}(\mathbf{r}_{w})\equiv \int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}< 0}I_{c}(\mathbf{r}_{w},\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}|d\Omega^{\prime} = \left[1 - \rho (\mathbf{r}_{w}^{\prime})\right]q_{o}(\mathbf{r}_{w}^{\prime})|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{c}^{\prime}|e^{-\tau_{c}} \tag{19.15}
$$

is a surface irradiation term due to the collimated beam, and its diffuse reflection results in an additional surface source similar to  $I_{bw}$ . In this expression  $\mathbf{r}_{w}^{\prime}$  is the location at which the collimated beam enters the medium with a direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{c}^{\prime}$ , and  $\mathbf{r}_{w}$  is the next point on the enclosure surface that the beam hits after traversing through the medium, as shown in Fig. 19- 2b.

Inspection of equations (19.12) and (19.14) shows that, for isotropic scattering, the intensity field for  $I_{d}$  is readily determined from standard methods, after replacing  $I_{b}$  within the medium by  $I_{b} + (\sigma_{s} / \kappa)S_{c}$ , and  $I_{bw}$  at the enclosure surface by  $I_{bw} + (\rho /\epsilon)H_{c} / \pi$ . In the case of anisotropic scattering the emission term  $S_{c}$  becomes direction- dependent, which may necessitate slight changes in the solution procedure.

Example 19.1. Consider a plane- parallel slab of an absorbing and isotropically scattering medium as shown in Fig. 19- 3. The medium is gray (with absorption coefficient  $\kappa$ , scattering coefficient  $\sigma_{s}$ , and a refractive index of  $n = 1$ ), cold (i.e., essentially nonemitting) and of constant thickness  $L$ . At the top  $(z = 0)$  the layer is bounded by a nonparticipating gas  $(n = 1)$  and is exposed to solar radiation impinging at  $\theta_{o}$  off- normal. At the bottom of the layer  $(z = L)$  the medium is bounded by a cold black surface. Determine radiative heat flux (and its divergence) as functions of depth.

# Solution

Since both media have the same index of refraction the interface reflectivity is  $\rho = 0$  and  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_c = \hat{\mathbf{s}}_o$ ; from equation (19.11) we find immediately

$$
I_{c}(\tau ,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = q_{s}e^{-\tau /\mu_{o}}\delta (\hat{\mathbf{s}} -\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{o}),
$$

as well as

$$
S_{c}(\tau) = \frac{G_{c}}{4\pi} (\tau) = \frac{q_{s}}{4\pi} e^{-\tau /\mu_{o}},
$$

$$
\mathbf{q}_c(\tau) = q_se^{-\tau /\mu_o}\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o.
$$

The heat flux vector due to collimated irradiation has two components, one in the direction of  $\tau$ , the other in a direction normal to it (in the plane formed by  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o$  and the surface normal). Thus, the overall problem is two- dimensional. However, inspection of the source term in equation (19.12) shows that the source is isotropic, as are the boundary conditions for equation (19.12). Therefore,  $I_{d}$  can depend only on distance perpendicular to the surfaces,  $\tau$ , and on polar angle. Thus,

$$
\mu \frac{dI_d}{d\tau} +I_d = \omega \left[\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_d d\Omega ' + S_c\right] = \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\left[G_d(\tau) + G_c(\tau)\right].
$$

The boundary conditions are

$$
\begin{array}{llll}\tau = 0: & I(0,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = q_s\delta (\hat{\mathbf{s}} -\hat{\mathbf{s}}_o), & 0\leq \theta < \frac{\pi}{2},\\ \tau = \tau_c: & I(\tau_c,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = 0, & \frac{\pi}{2} < \theta \leq \pi , \end{array}
$$

or, after subtracting the collimated component,

$$
\begin{array}{r l r l r} & {\tau = 0:} & & {I_{d}(0,\mu) = 0,} & & {0< \mu \leq 1,}\\ & {} & & {}\\ & {\tau = \tau_{L}:} & & {I_{d}(\tau ,\mu) = 0,} & & {-1\leq \mu < 0.} \end{array}
$$

Therefore, with  $S = (\omega /4\pi)(G_d + G_c)$ , the solution for  $I_{d}$  is, from equation (14.21),

$$
G_{d}(\tau) = 2\pi \int_{0}^{\tau_{L}}\frac{\omega}{4\pi} (G_{d} + G_{c})(\tau^{\prime})E_{1}(|\tau -\tau^{\prime}|)d\tau^{\prime}.
$$

In nondimensional form, with  $\Phi (\tau) = (G_d + G_c) / q_s$ , this expression becomes

$$
\Phi (\tau) - e^{-\tau /\mu_o} = \frac{\omega}{2}\int_0^{\tau_L}\Phi (\tau ')E_1(|\tau -\tau '|)d\tau '.
$$

FIGURE 19-4 Nondimensional radiative heat flux in a purely scattering layer with collimated irradiation.

This integral equation must be solved numerically in the same fashion as equation (14.43). Once the function  $\Phi (\tau)$  has been determined, the diffuse component of the heat flux is found from equation (14.22) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\mathbf{q}_d(\tau) = q_d(\tau)\hat{\mathbf{k}} = 2\pi \int_{-1}^{1}I_d\mu d\mu \hat{\mathbf{k}},}\\ {q_d(\tau) = 2\pi \left\{\int_0^{\tau}\frac{\omega}{4\pi} (G_d + G_c)(\tau ')E_2(\tau -\tau ')d\tau ' - \int_{\tau}^{\tau_L}\frac{\omega}{4\pi} (G_d + G_c)(\tau ')E_2(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau '\right\} .} \end{array}
$$

Finally, the total heat flux in the  $\tau$ - direction, on a nondimensional basis, is

$$
\Psi = \frac{\mathbf{q}_c\cdot\hat{\mathbf{k}} + q_d}{q_s} = \mu_oe^{-\tau /\mu_o} + \frac{\omega}{2}\left[\int_0^\tau \Phi (\tau ')E_2(\tau -\tau ')d\tau ' - \int_\tau^{\tau_L}\Phi (\tau ')E_2(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau '\right].
$$

The divergence of the radiative heat flux is found from equation (10.59) as

$$
\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \mathbf{q} = (1 - \omega)(4\pi I_{b} - G) = -(1 - \omega)(G_{c} + G_{d}),
$$

or in nondimensional form

$$
\frac{1}{q_s}\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \mathbf{q} = -(1 - \omega)\Phi .
$$

Some results for a purely scattering medium  $(\omega = 1)$  are shown in Fig. 19- 4. For that case we find  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = 0$  and, since the tangential component of  $\mathbf{q}_c$  does not depend on tangential direction,  $\mathbf{q}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{k}} =$  const and  $\Psi =$  const. Thus, evaluating the heat flux at  $\tau = 0$ , we get

$$
\Psi (\omega = 1) = \mu_o - \frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\tau_L}\Phi (\tau ')E_2(\tau ')d\tau '.
$$

# 19.3 THE MODIFIED  $P_{1}$ -APPROXIMATION WITH COLLIMATED IRRADIATION

As for problems without collimated irradiation, exact or approximate solutions to equation (19.12), together with its boundary condition (19.14), may be found using a variety of different methods.

As an illustration we will show here how the  $P_{1}$ - approximation may be applied to problems with collimated irradiation, following the development of Modest and Tabanfar [47]. The  $P_{1}$  or differential approximation is simple to use (requiring only the solution of an elliptic differential equation) and powerful (applicable to multidimensional geometries, as well as to anisotropic scattering). Unfortunately, the fact that the  $P_{1}$ - approximation is accurate only for smoothly varying (with direction) intensity fields makes the method particularly unsuitable for problems with collimated irradiation. However, once the collimated intensity,  $I_{c}$ , has been removed from the intensity field, similar to the development in Section 16.8, the resulting modified  $P_{1}$ - approximation may be expected to give accurate solutions to equations (19.12) and (19.14) for many situations. To apply the method, we assume again that the remnant intensity can deviate only slightly from isotropic conditions or, from equation (16.31),

$$
I_{d}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\simeq \frac{1}{4\pi}\left[G_{d}(\mathbf{r}) + 3\mathbf{q}_{d}(\mathbf{r})\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}\right]. \tag{19.16}
$$

As in Section 16.5 we shall limit ourselves to linear- anisotropic scattering,

$$
\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}},\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}) = 1 + A_{1}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}, \tag{19.17}
$$

so that

$$
\begin{array}{l}{S_{c} = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{c}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})(1 + A_{1}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})d\Omega^{\prime}}\\ {= \frac{1}{4\pi} (G_{c} + A_{1}\mathbf{q}_{c}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \frac{1}{4\pi} [1 - \rho (\mathbf{r}_{w})]q(\mathbf{r}_{w})e^{-\tau_{c}}(1 + A_{1}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}).} \end{array} \tag{19.18}
$$

Now, integrating equation (19.12) over all directions (zeroth moment), we obtain

$$
\nabla_{\tau}\cdot \mathbf{q}_{d} = (1 - \omega)(4\pi I_{b} - G_{d}) + \omega G_{c}. \tag{19.19}
$$

Similarly, integrating equation (19.12) after multiplication with  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  and invoking equation (19.16), we obtain

$$
\frac{1}{3}\nabla_{\tau}G_{d} = -\left(1 - \frac{A_{1}\omega}{3}\right)\mathbf{q}_{d} + \frac{A_{1}\omega}{3}\mathbf{q}_{c}. \tag{19.20}
$$

As for the standard  $P_{1}$ - approximation, the necessary boundary conditions for this set of equations are found by demanding continuity of heat flux normal to the surface at the boundary, that is,

$$
\mathbf{q}_d\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} (\mathbf{r}_w) = \int_{4\pi}I_d(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega , \tag{19.21}
$$

with  $I_{d}(\mathbf{r}_{w},\hat{\mathbf{s}})$  from equation (19.16) for incoming directions  $(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} < 0)$ , and from equation (19.14) for outgoing directions  $(\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} >0)$ . Calculating first the diffuse irradiation leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{-H_d(\mathbf{r}_w) = \int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} < 0}I_d(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{\pi /2}^{\pi}(\boldsymbol {G}_d + 3\mathbf{q}_d\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}})\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} d\Omega}\\ {= \frac{1}{2}\int_{\pi /2}^{\pi}(\boldsymbol {G}_d + 3\mathbf{q}_d\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\cos \theta)\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta = -\frac{G_d}{4} +\frac{\mathbf{q}_d\cdot\hat{\mathbf{n}}}{2}.} \end{array} \tag{19.22}
$$

Thus,

$$
\mathbf{q}_d\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \epsilon \pi I_{bw} + \rho (H_c + H_d) - H_d,
$$

or, after substituting equation (19.22),

$$
\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{r}_w:\qquad 2\mathbf{q}_d\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = \frac{\epsilon(4\pi I_{bw} - G_d) + 4(1 - \epsilon)H_c}{2 - \epsilon}. \tag{19.23}
$$

The derivation of equations (19.19) and (19.20) is very similar to the development of the standard  $P_{1}$ - approximation, which has been given in some greater detail in Section 16.5.

Example 19.2. Find the solution to the previous example using the  $P_{1}$ - approximation.

# Solution

As for the exact solution we find

$$
G_{c} = q_{s}e^{-\tau /\mu_{o}},\qquad \mathbf{q}_{c} = G_{c}\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{o},
$$

and we realize again that  $G_{d}$  and  $\mathbf{q}_d = q_d\hat{\mathbf{k}}$  depend on  $\tau$  (optical distance perpendicular to the layer) only. Thus, from equations (19.19) and (19.20) and their boundary conditions (19.23), we find that

$$
\begin{array}{rl}\frac{dq_d}{d\tau} & = -(1 - \omega)G_d + \omega G_c,\\ \displaystyle \frac{dG_d}{d\tau} & = -3q_d, \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}\tau = 0: & {} & 2q_d = -G_d,\\ \tau = \tau_L: & {} & -2q_d = -G_d. \end{array}
$$

Since the solution procedure for this equation is different for  $\omega = 1$  (as opposed to  $\omega < 1$ ), and since we would like to compare the present results with exact ones shown in Fig. 19- 4, we shall limit the rest of our discussion to  $\omega = 1$ . Then

$$
\frac{dq_d}{d\tau} = q_se^{-\tau /\mu_o},\quad \mathrm{or}\quad q_d = -\mu_oq_se^{-\tau /\mu_o} + C_1,
$$

$$
\frac{dq_d}{d\tau} = -3q_d,\quad \mathrm{or}\quad G_d = -3\mu_o^2 q_se^{-\tau /\mu_o} - 3C_1\tau +C_2.
$$

It follows from the boundary conditions that

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{\tau = 0:} & {2C_1 + C_2 = (2 + 3\mu_o)\mu_oq_s,}\\ {\tau = \tau_L:} & {(2 + 3\tau_L)C_1 - C_2 = (2 - 3\mu_o)\mu_oq_se^{-\tau /\mu_o},} \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{l}{C_1 = \frac{2 + 3\mu_o + (2 - 3\mu_o)e^{-\tau_L / \mu_o}}{4 + 3\tau_L}\mu_oq_s,}\\ {}\\ {q_d = \left[\frac{2 + 3\mu_o + (2 - 3\mu_o)e^{-\tau_L / \mu_o}}{4 + 3\tau_L} -e^{-\tau / \mu_o}\right]\mu_oq_s.} \end{array}
$$

Finally,

$$
\Psi = \frac{\mathbf{q}_c\cdot\hat{\mathbf{k}} + q_d}{q_c} = \frac{2 + 3\mu_o + (2 - 3\mu_o)e^{-\tau_L / \mu_o}}{4 + 3\tau_L}\mu_o,
$$

which, as discussed in the previous example, is constant across the layer. This nondimensional heat flux is compared with the exact result in Fig. 19- 4. It is seen that the  $P_{1}$ - approximation gives good accuracy for all cases shown in that figure.

Some two- dimensional examples for the  $P_{1}$ - approximation with collimated irradiation have been given by Modest and Tabanfar [47], comparing with exact results by Crosbie and Koewing [48] and Crosbie and Dougherty [10]. The accuracy of the  $P_{1}$ - approximation was found to be excellent in most cases, since it is generally applied to an "emitting" medium with cold boundaries. As expected, the accuracy of the  $P_{1}$ - approximation decreases if sharp gradients of the radiative source occur within the medium (e.g., a source resulting from scattering of a highly focused, penetrating laser beam).

# 19.4 SHORT-PULSED COLLIMATED IRRADIATION WITH TRANSIENT EFFECTS

If a laser pulse of extremely short duration, usually accompanied by strong temporal variation over the duration of the pulse, impinges on a medium, the transient term in the radiative transfer equation becomes of importance. Therefore, according to equation (10.20), equation (19.12) must be reformulated as

$$
\frac{1}{\beta c}\frac{\partial I_d}{\partial t} (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}},t) + \frac{1}{\beta}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla I_d(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = -I_d(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + \frac{\omega}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_d(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}},\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})d\Omega^{\prime}\\ +(1 - \omega)I_b(\mathbf{r}) + \omega S_c(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}), \tag{19.24}
$$

in which the "diffuse intensity"  $I_{d}$  and the scattering source  $S_{c}$  are now functions of time as well as of location and direction. Furthermore, the remnant of the collimated irradiation, entering the medium at point  $\mathbf{r}_w,$  arrives at location  $\mathbf{r}$  with a time delay of  $s / c = |\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_w| / c$  . Therefore, equation (19.13) must be replaced by

$$
S_{c}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}},t) = \frac{1}{4\pi} [1 - \rho (\mathbf{r}_{w})]q_{o}(\mathbf{r}_{w},t - s / c)e^{-\tau_{c}}\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{c}). \tag{19.25}
$$

The boundary conditions remain essentially unchanged [except for the time delay in  $q_{o}$  in equation (19.15)]. Equation (19.24) is hyperbolic in nature, i.e., the signal (intensity) can travel (and change) with a signal velocity of  $c$  (the speed of light). This is also immediately obvious from the source term, equation (19.25). This set of equations has been solved, after transformation into an integral formulation, by Tan and Hsu [49] for a one- dimensional layer, and by Wu and Wu [27- 30] for one- dimensional and two- dimensional, axisymmetric slabs. Hsu [50] used the Monte Carlo method of Chapter 21 to predict incident radiation and fluxes in a one- dimensional slab, while Guo and coworkers [24] employed the Monte Carlo method for a two- dimensional, axisymmetric field. The backward Monte Carlo scheme was applied by Lu and Hsu [51, 52] to predict one- dimensional slab reflectivities and transmissivities.

A number of approximate models based on the RTE solution methods presented in Chapters 15- 17 have also been developed. Considering a one- dimensional slab with nonreflecting boundaries, Kumar and coworkers [21] extended the modified  $P_{1}$  - approximation to this case, and a little later Mitra and Kumar [23] added two- flux and discrete ordinates formulations. They noted that the signal velocity of the two- flux approximation is only  $c / 2$  , while the  $P_{1}$  - approximation has a signal velocity of  $c / \sqrt{3}$  . As higher- order methods are used, either spherical harmonics,  $P_N,$  or discrete ordinates,  $S_{N},$  the correct signal velocity,  $c,$  is approached. Noting this incorrect phase velocity of the  $P_{1}$  - approximation, Olson and colleagues [25] and Morel [26] modified the method into what they dubbed the  $P_{1 / 3}$  - approximation.

Several investigators [43, 53, 54] extended the regular discrete ordinates method (DOM) to transient problems, and Chai and coworkers [55- 57] did so for the related finite volume method (FVM) as applied to one- , two- , and three- dimensional problems. Finally, Liu and coworkers [58- 60] showed how a variant of the FVM, using discontinuous finite elements for spatial discretization, can be employed for transient calculations. Apparently, Liu and Hsu [60] have been the first to recognize that, because equation (19.24) is linear in time, solutions to arbitrary temporal pulse shapes (and pulse trains) can be found by superposition.

In all cases discussed above the medium was assumed to be nonemitting. A few studies have considered heating of the material and emission from it, assuming radiative equilibrium to hold, equation (10.74) [61, 62], and some included Fourier conduction, as well [61, 63], and even hyperbolic conduction [44].

Because of their simplicity and popularity, we will here briefly outline the development of, both, the  $P_{1}$  - and the  $P_{1 / 3}$  - approximations for a nonemitting medium.

# $P_{1}$  -Formulation

The starting point is now the augmented RTE, equation (19.24). After taking the zeroth and first moments, and again using the near- isotropy condition, equation (19.16), and the assumption of linear- anisotropic scattering, equation (19.17), the augmented  $P_{1}$  - equations (19.19) and (19.20) become

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{\partial G_d}{\partial t^*} +\nabla_\tau \cdot \mathbf{q}_d = (1 - \omega)(4\pi I_b - G_d) + \omega G_c,\\ \displaystyle \frac{\partial\mathbf{q}_d}{\partial t^*} +\frac{1}{3}\nabla_\tau G_d = -\left(1 - \frac{A_1\omega}{3}\right)\mathbf{q}_d + \frac{A_1\omega}{3}\mathbf{q}_c, \end{array} \tag{19.27}
$$

where  $t^* = \beta ct$  is a nondimensional time. These equations are, of course, identical to equations (19.19) and (19.20) except for the addition of a transient term. As for the exact formulation, the boundary conditions, equation (19.23), remain unchanged [again, except for the time delay in  $q_{o}$  in equation (19.15)]. Elimination of  $\mathbf{q}_d$  from equations (19.26) and (19.27) results in a hyperbolic wave equation for  $G_{d}$  with a signal velocity of  $c / \sqrt{3}$

# $P_{1 / 3}$  -Formulation

Olson and coworkers [25] noticed that, if the transient term in equation (19.27) is multiplied by  $1 / 3,$  the resulting set of equations has the correct propagation velocity  $c,$  while still reducing to the correct steady- state  $P_{1}$  - approximation. The so- called  $P_{1 / 3}$  - approximation is, therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{c}\frac{\partial G_d}{\partial t^*} +\nabla_\tau \cdot \mathbf{q}_d = (1 - \omega)(4\pi I_b - G_d) + \omega G_c,\\ \displaystyle \frac{1}{3}\frac{\partial\mathbf{q}_d}{\partial t^*} +\frac{1}{3}\nabla_\tau G_d = -\left(1 - \frac{A_1\omega}{3}\right)\mathbf{q}_d + \frac{A_1\omega}{3}\mathbf{q}_c, \end{array} \tag{19.28}
$$

again subject to the boundary condition, equation (19.23). While the multiplication by the factor  $1 / 3$  appears arbitrary, one should keep in mind that equation (19.27) is already approximate (through the use of the near- isotropy condition, equation (19.16)), and thus can be augmented by a transient term to produce the desired result.

Example 19.3. Consider a cold medium of width  $L$ $(0\leq x\leq L)$  with refractive index  $n = 1,$  bounded by vacuum (resulting in nonreflecting interfaces). The medium absorbs, scatters isotropically, and is subjected to a square laser pulse at  $x = 0$  according to

$$
q_{o}(0,t) = q_{o}[H(t) - H(t - t_{p})],
$$

where  $t_p$  is the duration of the pulse and  $H(t)$  is Heaviside's unit step function.4 Determine the transmissivity of the slab as a function of time. (This is essentially the example problem carried out by Mitra and Kumar [23] and by Wu and Ou [31].)

# Solution

For a nonemitting and isotropically scattering, one- dimensional medium, the equations for the  $P_{1}$  - and  $P_{1 / 3}$  - approximations reduce to

$$
\begin{array}{c}\frac{\partial G}{\partial t^*} +\frac{\partial q}{\partial\tau} = -(1 - \omega)G + \omega G_c,\\ 3a\frac{\partial q}{\partial t^*} +\frac{\partial G}{\partial\tau} = -3q, \end{array}
$$

where  $a = 1$  for  $P_{1}$  and  $a = 1 / 3$  for  $P_{1 / 3},$  and  $G$  and  $q$  have been normalized as  $G = G_{d} / q_{o}$  and  $q = q_{d} / q_{o}$  These two equations are subject to the initial and boundary conditions

$$
\begin{array}{rl}t^{*} = 0: & G(0,\tau) = q(0,\tau) = 0,\\ \tau = 0: & -2q(t^{*},0) = G(t^{*},0),\\ \tau = \tau_{\mathrm{L}}: & +2q(t^{*},\tau_{\mathrm{L}}) = G(t^{*},\tau_{\mathrm{L}}). \end{array}
$$

![](images/3dba78fddb3fe39cc8ad12b45a590a842a885b0c788c7ff98516c4179a6494b2.jpg)  
FIGURE 19-5 Transient transmissivity of an absorbing-scattering slab subjected to a collimated square laser pulse  $(t_{p}^{*} = 0.3, \tau_{L} = 5)$ .

The normalized isotropic scattering source is immediately found from equations (19.25) and (19.18) for a nonreflecting boundary, as

$$
G_{c}(t^{*},\tau) = \left[H(t^{*} - \tau) - H^{*}(t^{*} - \tau -t_{p}^{*})\right]e^{-\tau}.
$$

The hyperbolic nature of this set of equations becomes obvious, if  $q$  is eliminated from them (by differentiating the first with respect to  $t^{*}$  and the second with respect to  $\tau$ ), leading to

$$
\frac{\partial^2G}{\partial t^*^2} -\frac{1}{3a}\frac{\partial^2G}{\partial\tau^2} +\left(1 - \omega +\frac{1}{a}\right)\frac{\partial G}{\partial t^*} +\frac{1 - \omega}{a} G - \frac{\omega}{a} G_c - \omega \frac{\partial G_c}{\partial t^*} = 0,
$$

which has a signal velocity of  $1 / \sqrt{3a}$  (nondimensional in terms of speed of light,  $c$ ), as already indicated in the formulation for the  $P_{a}$  methods. Eliminating  $q$  also from the initial and boundary conditions gives

$$
\begin{array}{l}{t^{*} = 0:G(0,\tau) = \frac{\partial G}{\partial t^{*}} (0,\tau) = 0,}\\ {\tau = 0:3\bigg(G(t^{*},0) + a\frac{\partial G}{\partial t^{*}} (t^{*},0)\bigg) - 2\frac{\partial G}{\partial\tau} (t^{*},0) = 0,}\\ {\tau = \tau :3\bigg(G(t^{*},0) + a\frac{\partial G}{\partial t^{*}} (t^{*},0)\bigg) + 2\frac{\partial G}{\partial\tau} (t^{*},0) = 0.} \end{array}
$$

This second- order hyperbolic equation is readily solved by the method of characteristics [64] along the characteristic lines  $\tau = \pm t^{*} / \sqrt{3a}$ , and this was done in the program transPN given in Appendix F. Some typical results for the temporal transmission rate,  $[q_{c}(\tau_{L}) + q_{a}(\tau_{L})] / q_{o}$ , are shown in Fig. 19- 5, for a slab with an optical thickness of  $\tau_{L} = 5$  and a nondimensional pulse width  $t_{p}^{*} = 0.3$  and are compared with results from a Monte Carlo simulation (see Problem 21.8). The transmissivity remains zero until  $t^{*} = \tau_{L}$ , since it takes the direct component that amount of time to traverse the layer. As is clearly visible in the inset, between  $\tau_{L}< t^{*}< \tau_{L} + t_{p}^{*}$  the transmissivity is dominated by the direct component  $q_{c}(\tau_{L}) / q_{o}$ , while the scattered contribution builds up gradually and, for  $\omega = 1$ , reaches its maximum around  $t^{*} = 9$ . It is apparent that the  $P_{1}$ - approximation, with its  $c / \sqrt{3}$  signal velocity, woefully lags behind the true transmissivity, and later overshoots, while the  $P_{1 / 3}$ - approximation predicts the transient behavior rather accurately.

Wu and Ou [31] used a clipped Gaussian laser pulse (rather than the square pulse), and noted that the  $P_{1}$ - approximation produced an unphysical, secondary spike at  $t^{*} = \sqrt{3} \tau_{L}$  (i.e., the time it takes radiation scattered at  $\tau = 0$  to reach  $\tau = \tau_{L}$  in a direct path), while the  $P_{1 / 3}$ - approximation

does not show this behavior. Apparently, this is due to the fact that, for a Gaussian profile,  $\partial G_{c} / \partial t^{*} \neq 0$ , which produces the secondary peak (this may be verified by running transPN with its preprogrammed Gaussian pulse).

Since the transient RTE is hyperbolic in nature, the method of characteristics is often used in numerical solutions (including transPN), in order to accurately capture the radiation wavefront. Katika and Pilon [65] introduced a modified (backward) characteristic method that gives better flexibility in time stepping. If hyperbolic equations are solved by conventional differencing, second- order time schemes are generally preferred. Olson [63, 66] has discussed several first- and second- order time stepping techniques for such methods.

# Problems

19.1 A semi- infinite, gray, isotropically scattering medium, originally at zero temperature, is subjected to collimated irradiation with a constant flux  $q_0$  normal to its nonreflecting surface. Set up the integral relationships governing steady- state temperature and radiative heat flux within the medium, assuming radiative equilibrium.

19.2 In a greenhouse a layer of water (thickness  $L = 5\mathrm{cm}$ ) is resting on top of a black substrate. The water is loaded with growing organisms that scatter light isotropically but do not absorb ( $\sigma_s = 0.2\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ). The water layer is illuminated by two long growth- enhancing lights, fitted with reflector shields that make the light essentially parallel, as shown in the sketch, each light delivering a heat flux of  $q_0 = 100\mathrm{W / m^2}$  (per unit area normal to the light rays). Using the exact method, calculate energy generated within the water and the radiative heat flux absorbed by the black surface in the zone between the lights, where the heat transfer is essentially one- dimensional. Emission from the water and substrate are negligible.

Hint: Use Figs. 3- 16 and 19- 4.

19.3 Reconsider the medium described in Example 19.1. Rather than being bounded by a cold black surface at the bottom, the layer is now exposed to the nonparticipating gas as well as to solar irradiation (using mirrors) on both sides. Determine radiative heat flux and its divergence within the layer in terms of the function  $\Phi (\pi_{\iota},\omega ,\mu_{0},\tau)$  given in Example 19.1.

19.4 Solve Problem 19.1 using the  $P_1$ - approximation.

19.5 The starship Enterprise is hitting a Klingon cruiser with its phaser gun. The armament of the cruiser is a partially reflecting material that, after some irradiation, partly evaporates, forming a protective gas layer above the surface. Assuming that the surface is at evaporation temperature  $T_{\mathrm{ev}}$  and has an emittance  $\epsilon$ , and that the gas has an absorption coefficient  $\kappa_g$  and a thickness  $L$ , determine the

fraction of the heat flux that hits the Klingon ship. Under these conditions you may assume the effects of conduction and convection to be negligible (but not reradiation from the gas). Use the  $P_{1}$ - approximation.

19.6 Reconsider Problem 19.5. After further irradiation, the surface material starts to disintegrate, spewing particulate material into the gas layer. If we make the assumption that the debris has an absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{p}$  and (isotropic) scattering coefficient  $\sigma_{sp}$ , how does this modify the surface irradiation?

19.7 Consider a semi- infinite gray medium with a nonreflecting surface. The medium is cold, and absorbs (absorption coefficient  $\kappa$ ) and scatters isotropically (scattering coefficient  $\sigma_{s}$ ). Collimated radiation obeying the relation

$$
\mathbf{q}_c = q_0(1 - \cos \alpha \tau_x)\mathbf{k}
$$

shines normally onto the medium as shown below. Determine the reflectivity of the medium (i.e., the fraction of the irradiation leaving the interface in the opposite direction), using the  $P_{1}$ - approximation. Hint: To solve the two- dimensional governing equation, set  $G_{d}(\tau_{x},\tau_{z}) = G_{1}(\tau_{z}) + G_{2}(\tau_{z})\cos \alpha \tau_{x}$ .

This problem is a special case of solutions given by Crosbie and Koewing [48] (exact) and Modest and Tabanfar [47]  $(P_{1})$ .

19.8 Reconsider Problem 19.2 for lights not fitted with reflector shields as depicted in the adjacent sketch. Assuming that the figure shows only two of many equally spaced lights (i.e., using symmetry), set up the solution for the radiative heat flux, using the  $P_{1}$ - approximation. Each light outputs a total of  $100W$  per meter length. Since this is a two- dimensional problem it will be sufficient to reduce the problem to the solution of a two- dimensional partial differential equation with stated boundary conditions.

19.9 A slab of constant thickness  $L$  consisting of an absorbing and linear- anisotropically scattering medium, is subjected to collimated laser irradiation with a Gaussian flux profile  $q_{0}(r) = (\mathcal{Q}\dot{)} / \pi w^{2})e^{- 2(r / w)^{2}}$  normal to its nonreflecting surface, where  $r$  is radial distance from the beam center,  $w$  is the so- called  $\epsilon_{1} / e^{2}$  beam radius" and  $Q$  is total laser power (in W). Assuming the temperature of the medium to be moderate, emission can generally be neglected as compared to the laser flux. Show that this problem can be solved by the modified  $P_{1}$ - approximation, using subroutine P1 sor and/or program P1- 2D of Appendix F. Then determine the reflectivity of the medium (i.e., the fraction of the irradiation leaving the interface in the opposite direction), as a function of radius  $r$ , for a purely isotropically scattering medium with  $\sigma_{s} = 5\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ,  $L = 1\mathrm{cm}$ , and  $w = 100\mu \mathrm{m}$ .

19.10 Repeat Example 19.3 for a clipped Gaussian laser pulse as considered by Wu and Ou [31], using program transPN of Appendix F.

19.11 Consider a cold medium of width  $L$ $(0\leq x\leq L)$  with refractive index  $n = 1$ , bounded by vacuum (resulting in nonreflecting interfaces). The medium absorbs, scatters isotropically, and is subjected to a CW ("continuous wave," or constant) laser pulse at  $x = 0$  and starting at time  $t = 0$ , according to

$$
q_{o}(0,t) = q_{o}H(t),
$$

where  $H(t)$  is Heaviside's unit step function. Determine the reflectivity and transmissivity of the slab as a function of time until steady state is achieved. Use program transPN of Appendix F.

# SOLUTION METHODS FOR NONGRAY EXTINCTION COEFFICIENTS

# 20.1 INTRODUCTION

In the preceding chapters on solution methods for the radiative equation of transfer within participating media we have exclusively dealt with gray media, that is, media whose radiative properties (absorption coefficient  $\kappa$ , scattering coefficient  $\sigma_{s}$ , and phase function  $\Phi$ , as well as emittance of boundary surfaces  $\epsilon$ ) do not vary across the electromagnetic spectrum. We noted that most relationships also hold true for a nongray medium on a spectral basis (i.e., as long as the simplification of radiative equilibrium is not invoked). While the assumption of gray surfaces made in the net radiation method of Chapters 5 (diffusely reflecting surfaces) and 6 (partly specular reflecting surfaces) is often a good one over the relatively small relevant part of the spectrum, this is nearly never the case for participating media. Molecular gases below ionization temperatures (discussed in detail in Chapter 11) absorb and emit over a multitude of very narrow spectral lines, which may overlap and form vibration- rotation bands. The result is an absorption coefficient that oscillates wildly within each band, and is zero between bands. Similarly, the discussion of radiative properties of suspended particles (Chapter 12) has shown that their absorption and scattering properties may also oscillate strongly across the spectrum (see, for example, Fig. 12- 3). However, if particles of varying sizes are present, as is usually the case, the spectral oscillations tend to be damped out so that the assumption of a gray medium becomes a reasonable one. Like molecular gases, semitransparent solids and liquids often display strong absorption bands in the infrared due to photon- phonon coupling, with weak absorption coefficients between bands. Therefore, we conclude that the simplification of a gray participating medium is, except for particle suspensions with variable sizes, a poor assumption that may lead to very significant errors in the analysis. It behooves the engineer to realize that accurate solutions to the equation of transfer (such as exact solutions in two or three dimensions), as opposed to simple approximate ones (such as the  $\rho_{1}$ - approximation in one or two dimensions), may be meaningless unless the spectral variation of radiation properties is taken into account.

Unfortunately, consideration of spectral variations of radiation properties tends to considerably increase the difficulty of an already extremely difficult problem, or at least make their numerical solution many times more computer- time intensive. All solution methods discussed

thus far, whether exact or approximate, are poorly suited for the consideration of nongray properties. In general, radiative heat flux, divergence of heat flux, and/or incident radiation must be evaluated for many, many spectral locations, followed by numerical quadrature of the spectral results. This process will always involve the guessing of a temperature field, followed by an iterative procedure. This statement is true even for the case of radiative equilibrium, since the condition  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = 0$  holds only for total heat flux, but not for spectral heat flux: While it is true that each volume element must emit as much radiative energy as it absorbs, the re- emission of energy must not occur at the same wavelength; the wavelengths of absorption are determined by the local absorption coefficient and by the wavelengths of the incoming radiation (and, thus, depend on the temperature of the surrounding medium), while the wavelengths of emission are determined by the local absorption coefficient and the local temperature.

In principle, if detailed information is given for the spectral extinction coefficient of the participating medium, such as contained in the high- resolution HITRAN [1] and HITEMP [2] databases for molecular gases, accurate determination of radiative fluxes and sources can be made. In practice, the rapid spectral variation of the gas absorption coefficient requires approximately one million spectral evaluations for such "line- by- line" (LBL) calculations, making them impractical for all applications except as benchmarks for the evaluation of more approximate models. In the field of combustion, the earliest full- spectrum heat transfer line- by- line calculations were perhaps carried out by Denison and Webb [3- 5], looking at one- dimensional slabs of water vapor- nitrogen mixtures with prescribed simple temperature profiles and constant water vapor concentration, using the HITRAN92 database. Riviere et al. [6] investigated a one- dimensional layer of air at  $T > 10000\mathrm{K}$ , and Pierrot and coworkers [7,8] considered one- dimensional layers of mixtures containing  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and/or  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  with various simple temperature and concentration profiles (steps, linear, parabolic), using the French database [9,10]. Similarly, Marin and Buckius [11] used the HITRAN92 database, while the later papers of Solovjov and Webb [12] and Modest and Zhang [13- 16] used the HITEMP 1995 database [17]. A one- dimensional homogeneous slab containing CO was considered by Solovjov and Webb [18]. All these line- by- line calculations were generated as benchmarks for approximate global models, which will be discussed later in this chapter. Somewhat different line- by- line calculations were carried out by Tang and Brewster, looking at Elsasser- model lines superimposed on the exponential wide band model [19], and Monte Carlo- generated line- by- line results for a  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  mixture with linear- anisotropically scattering particles [20], both again for a one- dimensional slab. In nonequilibrium aerospace applications virtually all calculations to date have been line- by- line, one- dimensional, and decoupled, since no spectral models were available until very recently. The earliest calculations were done by Park using NEQAIR [21]. Most planetary entry calculations have used this database in uncoupled fashion, e.g., Olynick and coworkers evaluated radiative fluxes for the FIRE II [22] and Stardust [23] missions, Olejniczak [24] considered radiative heating during aerocapture on Titan (one of Jupiter's moons), etc. Optimized LBL schemes have recently been reported by da Silva [25] and Feldick and coworkers [26], the latter closely coupled to a hypersonic flow code. The only two- dimensional line- by- line heat transfer calculations to date appear to have been carried out by Modest and Zhang [13,14,16], who considered an axisymmetric combustion chamber with strong spatial variations in temperature and concentration of methane, water vapor, and carbon dioxide, and by Hartung and Hassan [27], who applied the modified differential approximation of Section 16.8 to hypersonic entry problems.

The complexity and time consumption of nongray property treatment may be decreased considerably if one considers limiting situations, or if some simple approximations are made for the spectral dependence of the absorption and/or scattering coefficients. In the following we shall first consider the simplest method, known as the mean beam length method, in which the entire participating medium is assumed to be a single isothermal zone that exchanges heat with finite surface areas, much like the net radiation method of Chapter 5, followed by the semigray approximation, which is a gray model, but uses different spectrally weighted property values for emission and absorption. Next the box model is discussed, in which the absorption coefficient

FIGURE 20-1 Isothermal gas volume radiating to surface element: (a) arbitrary gas volume, (b) equivalent hemisphere radiating to center of its base.

is assumed to attain a finite number of values that remain constant over finite wavenumber regions. This is followed by several sections that deal much more rigorously with the band nature of molecular gases, but are more or less limited to one- dimensional, plane- parallel, nonscattering media confined between black plates, culminating with the weighted- sum- of- gray- gases model, which is a very simple, accurate, and powerful method. Finally, global models based on high- resolution databases and on the  $k$ - distributions described in Chapter 11 will be described, which allow very accurate determination of radiative heat transfer in arbitrary geometries, including reflecting walls and/or scattering media.

# 20.2 THE MEAN BEAM LENGTH METHOD

The idea of a mean beam length was first advanced by Hottel [28] for the determination of radiative heat fluxes from an isothermal volume of hot combustion gases to cold black furnace walls. With some difficulty the method may be extended to include the effects of hot and gray walls. We include here only a brief discussion of the method, primarily for historical reasons and since the notion of a mean beam length is sometimes employed by other methods (see, for example, the box model in the next section). A somewhat more detailed account has been given by Hottel [28] and Hottel and Sarofim [29]. Today, with the availability of fast digital computers the method is somewhat outdated and is commonly replaced by the related zonal method, discussed in detail in Chapter 18, which allows not only for hot and gray walls, but also for a number of isothermal subvolumes within the enclosure.

# Definition of Mean Beam Lengths

Consider a hot, isothermal, nonscattering gas volume radiating toward a black area element  $dA$  on its surface, as shown in Fig. 20- 1a. The spectral heat flux arriving at and absorbed by  $dA$  from a volume element is equal to the spectral emission by  $dV$  into all  $(4\pi)$  directions  $\times$  the fraction intercepted by  $dA \times$  the fraction transmitted along the path from  $dV$  to  $dA$ . Thus, from equation (10.51) the spectral heat flux arriving at  $dA$  from all volume elements may be written as

$$
q_{\eta}dA(\mathbf{r}_w) = \int_V(4\pi \kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta}dV)\times \left(\frac{dA\cos\theta}{4\pi S^2}\right)\times e^{-\kappa_{\eta}S},
$$

or

$$
q_{\eta}(\mathbf{r}_w) = I_{b\eta}\int_Ve^{-\kappa_{\eta}S}\frac{\kappa_{\eta}\cos\theta dV}{S^2}, \tag{20.1}
$$

where we have chosen wavenumber  $\eta$  as the spectral variable. We notice that, in general, the heat flux from a hot gas volume arriving at a surface element  $dA$  is proportional to the blackbody intensity  $I_{b\eta}$  and a factor which depends on the spectral absorption coefficient as well as on the geometry of the medium. While the integral factor will not be trivial to evaluate for most geometries, it is readily determined for a hemispherical volume radiating to the center of its base,  $dA$ , as shown in Fig. 20.10. For this case  $S = r$  and  $dV = r^2\sin \theta drd\theta d\psi$ , leading to

$$
q_{\eta} = I_{b\eta}\int_{\psi = 0}^{2\pi}\int_{\theta = 0}^{\pi /2}\int_{r = 0}^{R}e^{-\kappa_{\eta}r}\kappa_{\eta}\cos \theta \sin \theta drd\theta d\psi = \pi I_{b\eta}(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}R}) = \pi I_{b\eta}\epsilon_{\eta}, \tag{20.2}
$$

where we have employed the definition for the spectral emissivity of an isothermal layer, equation (10.13). It is clear that the radiative heat fluxes arriving at  $dA$ , either from an arbitrary volume  $V$  or from a hemisphere of radius  $R$ , may be made equal if an appropriate value for the radius of the hemisphere is chosen. Thus, as far as the spectral, hemispherical irradiation onto  $dA$  is concerned, there is no difference whether the emission originated from an arbitrary volume or from an equivalent hemisphere of the correct radius  $R = L_{e}$ , where  $L_{e}$  is known as the mean beam length. Therefore, the definition of the mean beam length for an arbitrary volume irradiating an infinitesimal surface element  $dA$  is, from equations (20.1) and (20.2),

$$
\frac{q_{\eta}}{\pi I_{b\eta}} = 1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}L_{e}} = \int_{V}e^{-\kappa_{\eta}S}\frac{\kappa_{\eta}\cos\theta dV}{\pi S^{2}}. \tag{20.3}
$$

Note that the magnitude of the mean beam length depends on absorption coefficient as well as on geometry.

It is also common to define a mean beam length for an arbitrary volume irradiating a finite surface, by replacing the local heat flux  $q_{\eta}$  in equation (20.1) by a surface- averaged value, or

$$
\frac{q_{\eta_{e}W}}{\pi I_{b\eta}} = 1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}L_{e}} = \frac{1}{A}\int_{A}\int_{V}e^{-\kappa_{\eta}S}\frac{\kappa_{\eta}\cos\theta dV}{\pi S^{2}} dA. \tag{20.4}
$$

Example 20.1. Determine the mean beam length for an isothermal gas layer of thickness  $L$  radiating to  $(a)$  an infinitesimal surface element,  $(b)$  an entire bounding surface.

# Solution

The mean beam length may be evaluated by first finding from equation (14.40) the radiative heat flux hitting a surface element, or by integrating equation (20.3) directly. Choosing the latter for illustrative purposes, we express  $V$  in terms of a cylindrical coordinate system with its origin at  $dA$ . Thus,  $dV = 2\pi rdrdz$ ,  $S = \sqrt{r^2 + z^2}$ , and  $\cos \theta = z / S$ , leading to

$$
\frac{q_{\eta}}{E_{b\eta}} = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{z = 0}^{L}\int_{r = 0}^{\infty}e^{-\kappa_{\eta}S}\frac{\kappa_{\eta}z2\pi rdrdz}{S^{3}}.
$$

By replacing the integration variable  $r$  by  $S$ , this expression becomes, with  $rdr = SdS$ ,

$$
\frac{q_{\eta}}{E_{b\eta}} = 2\int_{z = 0}^{L}\int_{S = z}^{\infty}e^{-\kappa_{\eta}S}\frac{\kappa_{\eta}zdSdz}{S^{2}} = 2\kappa_{\eta}\int_{z = 0}^{L}E_{2}(\kappa_{\eta}z)dz,
$$

where the definition for the exponential integral has been employed [see equation (14.31) or Appendix E]. Integrating, we obtain

$$
\frac{q_{\eta}}{E_{b\eta}} = -2E_3(\kappa_{\eta}z)\bigg|_0^L = 1 - 2E_3(\kappa_{\eta}L),
$$

which, of course, would also have followed immediately from equation (14.40), if only emission from the medium had been considered ( $T_{1} = T_{2} = 0$ ).

Thus, from equation (20.3), the mean beam length from the gas layer to a surface element  $dA$  is

$$
L_{e} = \frac{1}{\kappa_{\eta}}\ln \frac{1}{2E_{3}(\kappa_{\eta}L)}.
$$

The mean beam length for the entire surface, equation (20.4), is the same since, for this one- dimensional problem, local and average heat flux are identical.

# Mean Beam Lengths for Optically Thin Media

Equations (20.3) and (20.4) are generally not trivial to evaluate and, for nongray media, the integrations need to be carried out for different absorption coefficients if total rather than spectral heat fluxes are desired (as is usually the case). However, the relationships become much simpler if optically thin media are considered, i.e., if  $\kappa_{\eta}L\ll 1$ , where  $L$  is a characteristic dimension of the medium. If we expand the exponents in equations (20.3) and (20.4), and drop terms of order  $\kappa_{\eta}^{2}$  and higher, we find the mean beam length for an optically thin volume radiating to a point on its surface,  $L_{0}$ , is

$$
1 - (1 - \kappa_{\eta}L_{0}) = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{V}1\times \frac{\kappa_{\eta}\cos\theta dV}{S^{2}},
$$

or

$$
L_{0} = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{V}\frac{\cos\theta dV}{S^{2}}. \tag{20.5}
$$

If we express the volume in terms of a spherical coordinate system centered at  $dA$ , with  $S$  as the radius, we may write  $dV = S^{2}dS\sin \theta d\theta d\psi = S^{2}dSd\Omega$ , and equation (20.5) becomes

$$
\begin{array}{l}{L_0 = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\psi = 0}^{2\pi}\int_{\theta = 0}^{\pi /2}\int_{S = 0}^{S_{\max}(\theta ,\psi)}\cos \theta \sin \theta dSd\theta d\psi}\\ {= \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{2\pi}S_{\max}(\hat{\mathbf{s}})\cos \theta d\Omega .} \end{array} \tag{20.6}
$$

Similarly, from equation (20.4), the mean beam length for an optically thin volume radiating to a finite surface is

$$
L_{0} = \frac{1}{\pi A}\int_{A}\int_{2\pi}S_{\max}(\mathbf{r}_{w},\hat{\mathbf{s}})\cos \theta d\Omega dA. \tag{20.7}
$$

By employing physical arguments, one finds that the solution of equation (20.7) is trivial for the case that  $A$  is the entire area bounding the volume  $V$ : The total emission from the entire volume is, from equation (10.54),  $4\pi \kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta}V$ . Since, for an optically thin medium, no self- absorption occurs, all of this energy must be absorbed by the (black) bounding surface. Therefore, the average heat flux onto the surface is

$$
q_{\eta} = 4\pi \kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta}V / A
$$

and, from equation (20.3) (with  $\kappa_{\eta}L_{0}\ll 1$ ),

$$
\frac{q_{\eta}}{\pi I_{b\eta}} = \kappa_{\eta}L_{0} = 4\kappa_{\eta}V / A
$$

or

$$
L_{0} = 4\frac{V}{A}. \tag{20.8}
$$

The mean beam lengths for optically thin media,  $L_{0}$ , are often called geometric mean beam lengths, based on the work by Dunkle [30].

Example 20.2. Determine the mean beam lengths of Example 20.1 for an optically thin gas layer.

# Solution

From the last example we have

$$
\frac{q_{\eta}}{E_{b\eta}} = 1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}L_{e}} = 1 - 2E_{3}(\kappa_{\eta}L),
$$

which, for  $\kappa_{\eta}L\ll 1$ , becomes

$$
\frac{q_{\eta}}{E_{b\eta}} = 1 - 1 + \kappa_{\eta}L_{0} = 1 - 2\left(\frac{1}{2} -\kappa_{\eta}L\right) = 2\kappa_{\eta}L,
$$

or

$$
L_0 = 2L.
$$

The mean beam length for the entire surface is, of course, again the same. This could also have been found immediately from equation (20.8) as

$$
L_{0} = 4\frac{V}{A} = 4\frac{A_{\mathrm{plate}}\times L}{2A_{\mathrm{plate}}} = 2L.
$$

Equation (20.8) is trivial to evaluate for any geometry, but even equations (20.7) (mean beam length to a part of the bounding surface) and (20.5) (mean beam length to a point on the bounding surface) are readily integrated for many configurations.

The geometric mean beam lengths between a gas volume and a bounding surface for a number of configurations, as collected by Hottel and Sarofim [29], with values for concentric cylinders and spheres added from Andersen and coworkers [31,32], have been summarized in Table 20.1.

# Spectrally Averaged Mean Beam Lengths

The spectral heat flux, generated by emission from an isothermal volume, that is absorbed by an element of the black bounding surface (or the average heat flux onto a finite area) is given by equation (20.2) as

$$
q_{\eta} = \epsilon_{\eta}(L_e)\pi I_{b\eta} = (1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}L_e})\pi I_{b\eta}, \tag{20.9}
$$

where the mean beam length  $L_{e}$  depends on the spectral absorption coefficient as well as the geometry of the volume. However, Hottel noticed that the spectral heat flux  $q_{\eta}$  is not very sensitive to the spectral fluctuations of  $L_{e}$ , and that replacing the spectrally varying  $L_{e}$  by an average mean beam length  $L_{m}$  (independent of  $\kappa_{\eta}$ ) predicts spectral heat fluxes with acceptable accuracy. This fact is demonstrated in Fig. 20- 2, which shows the ratio of exact and approximate spectral heat fluxes, that is,

$$
\frac{q_{\eta}\big(\kappa_{\eta}L_{e} = L_{e}(\kappa_{\eta})\big)}{q_{\eta}\big(\kappa_{\eta},L_{e} = L_{m} = \mathrm{const}\big)} = \frac{1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}L_{e}}}{1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}L_{m}}}. \tag{20.10}
$$

Two different geometries have been considered in Fig. 20- 2, namely, an infinite slab radiating to a point on its boundary (or to an entire face), as given by Example 20.1, and a spherical volume radiating to a point on its surface (or to its entire surface). Inspection of Fig. 20- 2 shows that the error in the evaluation of the spectral heat flux, if the average mean beam length is used, is never more than  $\sim 5\%$  (if a suitable  $L_{m}$  is chosen). This statement may be generalized to other geometries. Values for the average mean beam lengths have also been included in Table 20.1. Inspection of the ratio between average and optically thin mean beam lengths,  $L_{m} / L_{0}$ , shows that their value is generally in the vicinity of 0.9. Therefore, a value of

$$
L_{m}\simeq 0.9L_{0} = 3.6\frac{V}{A} \tag{20.11}
$$

is recommended for geometries for which values for  $L_{e}$  are not available.

Besides saving computational effort for the evaluation of  $L_{e}$ , employing an average value  $L_{m}$  has the tremendous advantage that it allows the straightforward spectral integration of equation (20.9), resulting in a total heat flux of

$$
q = \int_{0}^{\infty}q_{\eta}d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}L_{m}}\right)\pi I_{b\eta}(T)d\eta = \epsilon (L_{m},T)\pi I_{b}(T) = \epsilon (L_{m},T)n^{2}\sigma T^{4}, \tag{20.12}
$$

where  $\epsilon (L_{m},T)$  is the total emissivity of an isothermal gas layer of thickness  $L_{m}$ .

Example 20.3. Combustion products at  $p = 5$  bar,  $T = 1000\mathrm{K}$ , consisting of  $70\%$ $\mathrm{N}_2$ ,  $10\%$ $\mathrm{CO}_2$ , and  $20\%$ $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  are contained within a spherical container of radius  $R = 75\mathrm{cm}$ . Assuming that the container wall is cold and black, estimate the radiative heat flux to the wall.

# Solution

The radiative heat flux to the container walls is readily found from equation (20.12), once the total emissivity for the gas mixture has been determined for an average mean beam length of  $L_{m} = 0.65D\simeq 100\mathrm{cm}$ , as indicated by Table 20.1. Total emissivities for carbon dioxide- steam mixtures have been discussed in Chapter 11, and the total emissivity for this particular gas mixture for a  $100\mathrm{cm}$  thick layer has already been evaluated in Example 11.13 (surprise!) as  $\epsilon = 0.593$ . Therefore,

$$
q = 0.593\times 5.670\times 10^{-12}\times 1000^{4}\mathrm{W / cm}^{2} = 3.36\mathrm{W / cm}^{2}.
$$

Example 20.4. A  $1\mathrm{m}$  thick isothermal layer of pure  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  at a pressure of  $1$  bar and a temperature of  $1700\mathrm{K}$  is confined between two parallel, cold, black plates. Estimate the total heat loss from the gas using the mean beam length approach.

# Solution

Again, the heat flux to the walls is readily determined from equation (20.12) if the total emissivity for the mean beam length is known, which in this case is  $L_{m} = 1.76L = 176\mathrm{cm}$ . The total emissivity for the  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  may be determined from Fig. 11- 30 or equation (11.177). Using Fig. 11- 30, we find  $\epsilon_0$  (176 bar cm,  $1\mathrm{bar},1700\mathrm{K})\simeq 0.17$ . The correction factor  $\epsilon /\epsilon_0$  is determined from equation (11.178) with the correlation constants given in Table 11.4, which leads to  $\epsilon /\epsilon_0\simeq 1.00$  and, therefore,  $\epsilon \simeq 0.17$ . Substituting this value into equation (20.12), we obtain

$$
-q(0) = q(L) = 0.17\times 5.670\times 10^{-12}1700^{4}\mathrm{W / cm}^{2} = 8.05\mathrm{W / cm}^{2},
$$

and the total heat lost from both sides is  $2\times 8.05 = 16.1\mathrm{W / cm}^2$ . Had we used Leckner's correlation by calling subroutine totemiss in Appendix F, this would have returned  $\epsilon = 0.153$ , for a total heat loss of  $2\times 7.25 = 14.5\mathrm{W / cm}^2$ .

# 20.3 SEMIGRAY APPROXIMATIONS

It is common practice in engineering to treat properties as "constants," that is, as being independent of one or more dependent variables, primarily to linearize the problem. For example, in heat conduction it is generally assumed that the thermal conductivity is independent of temperature. Very accurate results can be obtained with such an analysis if  $(i)$  the temperature variation of the material's conductivity is not too strong, and  $(ii)$  an appropriate, constant "effective conductivity" can be found. It is tempting to use such simplifying assumptions in the calculation of radiative heat fluxes, in particular as far as spectral variations are concerned. A number of researchers, such as Viskanta [33], Finkleman and coworkers [34- 36], and Traugott [37, 38], have introduced several different "effective" absorption coefficients and incorporated them into "semigray" schemes, all with limited success.

Consider the volume of a participating medium at a uniform temperature  $T$  . If the medium is optically thin (i.e., it emits but does not absorb any of the emitted radiation), the total heat loss from the volume is, according to equation (10.54),

$$
Q = 4V\int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta}E_{b\eta}d\eta , \tag{20.13}
$$

or, with the definition of the Planck- mean absorption coefficient, equation (11.182),

$$
Q = 4V\kappa_{P}n^{2}\sigma T^{4}. \tag{20.14}
$$

This expression is equivalent to taking the direction- integrated equation of transfer (or conservation of radiative energy), equation (10.60), and integrating it over the entire volume after dropping the self- absorption term. Therefore, for optically thin media, it is reasonable to set

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = \int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta}(4\pi I_{b\eta} - G_{\eta})d\eta \simeq \kappa_{\rho}(4\pi I_{b} - G). \tag{20.15}
$$

On the other hand, for optically thick media radiative heat flux obeys the diffusion limit or, from equation (15.19) for an isotropically scattering medium,

$$
{\mathfrak{q}}_{\eta}\simeq-\frac{1}{3\beta_{\eta}}\nabla E_{b\eta}; \tag{20.16}
$$

and, using the definition of the Rosseland- mean extinction coefficient, equation (11.188),

$$
{\mathfrak{q}}=-\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{3\beta_{\eta}}\nabla E_{b\eta}d\eta=-\frac{1}{3\beta_{R}}\nabla E_{b}. \tag{20.17}
$$

Apparently, to make accurate calculations using a gray model, the effective absorption coefficient must be close to the Planck- mean for optically thin situations and close to the Rosseland- mean for optically thick cases. A simple (i.e., not dependent on geometry and, through it, optical thickness) average value should only be expected to give accurate results if the Planck- mean and Rosseland- mean are of similar value (while in real life they frequently are orders of magnitude apart, in particular for molecular gases).

Replacing  $E_{b}$  in equation (20.17) by incident radiation  $G$  gives, together with equation (20.15), a semigray  $P_{1}$  - approximation,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = \kappa_{P}(4\pi I_{b} - G),}\\ {\nabla G = -3\beta_{R}\mathbf{q}.} \end{array} \tag{20.18a}
$$

Eliminating  $\mathfrak{q}$  leads to a single equation for  $G_{j}$

$$
\nabla^2 G - 3\beta_R\kappa_P(G - 4\pi I_b) = 0, \tag{20.19}
$$

where we have assumed  $\kappa_{p}$  and  $\beta_{R}$  to be constant (spatially) for simplicity. Thus, comparing equation (20.19) with (16.39) (setting  $A_{1} = 0$  for isotropic scattering) leads to an effective absorption coefficient of

$$
\kappa_{\mathrm{eff}}\simeq \sqrt{\kappa_{p}\kappa_{R}}, \tag{20.20}
$$

which is quite commonly employed in gray analyses. However, equation (20.20) should only be used with great caution,  $(i)$  since accurate answers can be expected only if  $\kappa_{p} / \kappa_{R}$  is close to unity, and  $(ii)$  since use of the Rosseland- mean absorption coefficient is problematic for pure molecular gases. In the second instance the diffusion limit applies only to optically thick situations, while all molecular gases have transparent regions over large parts of the spectrum.

Consider a gas- particulate mixture, whose absorption coefficient may be written as

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \kappa_{p\eta} + \kappa_{g\eta} = \kappa_{p\eta} + \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\kappa_{n\eta}. \tag{20.21}
$$

Here  $\kappa_{p\eta}$  is the spectral absorption coefficient of the particles and  $\kappa_{g\eta}$  that of the gas, which is composed of  $N$  individual vibration- rotation bands, each with its own spectral absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{n\eta}$ . We shall also assume that the bands are relatively narrow, do not overlap, and may be described by the wide band model of Chapter 11. Then the Planck- mean absorption coefficient may be evaluated as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\kappa_{p} = \frac{1}{E_{b}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta}E_{b\eta}d\eta = \kappa_{p,p} + \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\frac{1}{E_{b}}\int_{\mathrm{band}n}\kappa_{n\eta}E_{b\eta}d\eta \\ \displaystyle \qquad \simeq \kappa_{p,p} + \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\frac{E_{b\eta_{n}}}{E_{b}}\int_{\mathrm{band}n}\kappa_{n\eta}d\eta = \kappa_{p,p} + \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\frac{E_{b\eta_{n}}}{E_{b}}\alpha_{n}, \end{array} \tag{20.22}
$$

where  $\alpha_{n}$  is the band strength parameter and  $E_{b\eta_{n}}$  is the spectral, blackbody emissive power at the band center, both for band  $n$ . The Rosseland- mean absorption coefficient may be evaluated similarly as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{1}{\kappa_R} = \int_0^\infty \frac{1}{\kappa_\eta}\frac{dE_{b\eta}}{dE_b} d\eta = \frac{1}{\kappa_{p,R}} -\int_0^\infty \left(\frac{1}{\kappa_{p\eta}} -\frac{1}{\kappa_\eta}\right)\frac{dE_{b\eta}}{dE_b} d\eta \\ \displaystyle \qquad \simeq \frac{1}{\kappa_{p,R}} -\sum_{n = 1}^N\left(\frac{dE_{b\eta}}{dE_b}\right)_{\eta_n}\int_{\mathrm{band}n}\left(\frac{1}{\kappa_{p\eta_n}} -\frac{1}{\kappa_{p\eta_n} + \kappa_{n\eta}}\right)d\eta , \end{array} \tag{20.23}
$$

where  $\kappa_{p\eta_{n}}$  is a constant average value, assuming that  $\kappa_{p\eta}$  does not vary greatly across each band. We shall also assume that, inside the integral,  $\kappa_{n\eta}$  may be replaced by the narrow band average,  $(S / d)_{\eta}$ , for which the wide band model stipulates [cf. equation (11.142)]

$$
\left(\frac{S}{d}\right)_\eta \simeq \frac{\alpha_n}{\omega_n} e^{-t|\eta | - \eta_n| / \omega_n}, \tag{20.24}
$$

where  $\omega_{n}$  is the band width parameter and  $t = 1$  for a band with head, and  $t = 2$  for a symmetric band. Substituting this expression into equation (20.23) leads to

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\int_{\mathrm{band}n}\left(\frac{1}{\kappa_{p\eta_{n}}} -\frac{1}{\kappa_{p\eta_{n}} + \kappa_{n\eta}}\right)d\eta = \frac{1}{\kappa_{p\eta_{n}}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{(S / d)_{\eta}}{\kappa_{p\eta_{n}} + (S / d)_{\eta}} d\eta}\\ & {\qquad = \frac{\alpha_{n}}{\kappa_{p\eta_{n}}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{e^{-x}d x}{\kappa_{p\eta_{n}} + (\alpha_{n} / \omega_{n})e^{-x}} = \frac{\omega_{n}}{\kappa_{p\eta_{n}}}\ln \left(1 + \frac{\alpha_{n}}{\omega_{n}\kappa_{p\eta_{n}}}\right),} \end{array} \tag{20.25}
$$

regardless of the value of  $t$  (cf. the development of Example 11.3). Thus,

$$
\frac{1}{\kappa_{n}} = \frac{1}{\kappa_{p,R}} -\sum_{n = 1}^{N}\frac{\omega_{n}}{\kappa_{p\eta_{n}}}\left(\frac{dE_{b\eta}}{dE_{b}}\right)_{\eta_{n}}\ln \left(1 + \frac{\alpha_{n}}{\omega_{n}\kappa_{p\eta_{n}}}\right). \tag{20.26}
$$

It is evident from equation (20.26) that for a pure molecular gas,  $\kappa_{R}\to 0$  . This statement is also true if the assumption of a narrow band is relaxed: It is readily observed that  $1 / \kappa_{n\eta}$  tends toward infinity faster than  $E_{b\eta}$  tends to zero for both  $\eta \to 0$  and  $\eta \to \infty$  . Clearly, for a pure molecular gas  $\kappa_{P} / \kappa_{R}\rightarrow \infty ,$  so that  $(i)$ $\kappa_{R}$  and equation (20.20) are not suitable for the determination of  $\kappa_{\mathrm{eff}},$  and  $(ii)$  accurate predictions should not be expected from the semigray approach.

Example 20.5. A molecular gas is confined between two parallel, black plates, spaced  $1\mathrm{m}$  apart, which are kept isothermal at  $T_{1} = 1200\mathrm{K}$  and  $T_{2} = 800\mathrm{K},$  respectively. The (hypothetical) gas has a single vibration- rotation band in the infrared, with an average absorption coefficient of

$$
\left(\frac{\sigma}{d}\right)_\eta = \frac{\alpha}{\omega} e^{-2\eta /\eta_0 / \eta_\omega},\quad \eta_0 = 3000\mathrm{cm}^{-1},\quad \omega = 200\mathrm{cm}^{-1},
$$

and an overlap parameter of  $\beta$  (see the discussion of narrow band and wide band models in Chapter 11). Assuming convection and conduction to be negligible, estimate the radiative heat flux between the two plates using the semigray model. Carry out the analysis for variable values of  $(\alpha /\omega)$  and  $\beta$  . Repeat the calculations for the same gas mixed with nonscattering particles whose absorption coefficient is  $\kappa_{p} = 0.1\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$  (gray).

# Solution

To make an "equivalent" gray analysis, a suitable gray absorption coefficient must be found. Since for a pure molecular gas the Rosseland- mean is inappropriate, and for want of any better value, we choose the Planck- mean absorption coefficient, which leads to

$$
\tau_{p} = \kappa_{r}L = \alpha \frac{E_{b\eta_{0}}}{\sigma T^{4}} L = \tau_{L}\frac{\omega E_{b\eta_{0}}(T)}{\sigma T^{4}},\quad \tau_{L} = \left(\frac{\alpha}{\omega}\right)L.
$$

Consequently,  $\tau_{p}$  depends on the local temperature of the gas, even if  $(\alpha /\omega) = \mathrm{const}$  .To simplify the analysis we use a constant Planck- mean absorption coefficient evaluated at some average temperature, say  $T_{\mathrm{av}} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  Thus,  $\eta_0 / T_{\mathrm{av}} = 3\mathrm{cm}^{- 1} / \mathrm{K}$  and, from Appendix C,

$$
\tau_{p} = \frac{200\times 1.36576\times 10^{-8}}{5.670\times 10^{-8}\times 1000}\times \tau_{L} = 0.0482\tau_{L}.
$$

For a gray medium the radiative heat flux between the two plates is determined from Example 15.5 for the  $P_{1}$  - approximation as

$$
\Psi_{\mathrm{gray}} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{3}{4}\tau_p} = \frac{1}{1 + 0.0362\tau_L}.
$$

If a particle background is present, it is better to utilize  $\kappa_{\mathrm{eff}}$  from equation (20.20). Thus, with  $\tau_{p} = \kappa_{p}L = 0.1\times 1 = 0.1,$

$$
\tau_{p} = 0.1 + 0.0482\tau_{L},
$$

$$
\frac{1}{\tau_{\mathrm{R}}} = \frac{1}{\tau_{p}} -\frac{1}{\tau_{p}}\left(\omega \frac{dE_{b\eta}}{dE_{b}}\right)_{\eta_{n}}\ln \left(1 + \frac{\tau_{L}}{\tau_{p}}\right).
$$

From equation (1.14) it follows that

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\omega \frac{d E_{b\eta}}{d E_{b}} = \frac{\omega}{4\sigma T^{3}}\frac{d E_{b\eta}}{d T} = \frac{\omega}{4\sigma T^{3}}\frac{d}{d T}\left[\frac{C_{1}\eta^{3}}{\exp\left(C_{2}\eta / T\right) - 1}\right]}\\ & {\quad = \frac{\omega C_{1}\eta^{3}}{4\sigma T^{3}}\frac{\exp\left(C_{2}\eta / T\right)C_{2}\eta / T^{2}}{\left[\exp\left(C_{2}\eta / T\right) - 1\right]^{2}} = \frac{1}{4}\frac{\omega E_{b\eta}}{E_{b}}\frac{\left(C_{2}\eta / T\right)\exp\left(C_{2}\eta / T\right)}{\exp\left(C_{2}\eta / T\right) - 1},} \end{array}
$$

$$
\left(\omega \frac{dE_{b\eta}}{dE_b}\right)_{\eta_n} = \frac{1}{4}\times 0.0482\times \frac{4.3164e^{4.3164}}{e^{4.3164} - 1} = 0.0527,
$$

$$
\tau_{\scriptscriptstyle R} = \frac{0.1}{1 - 0.0527\ln(1 + 10\tau_{\scriptscriptstyle L})}.
$$

$\tau_{p}$  and  $\tau_{R}$  may be calculated for any  $\tau_{L},$  and the heat flux becomes

$$
\Psi = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{3}{4}\sqrt{\tau_{p}\tau_{R}}}.
$$

FIGURE 20-3 Nondimensional radiative heat flux for radiative equilibrium across a molecular gas-particulate layer bounded by parallel, black walls, calculated by the semigray method.

Representative results are shown in Fig. 20- 3, together with exact results found by the Monte Carlo method [39,40], and results from the weighted- sum- of- gray- gases method (discussed later in this chapter). Clearly, for a pure molecular gas the semigray approximation fails miserably, since the Planck- mean is much too large to be a good effective absorption coefficient for optically thick bands. With a particle background the method performs considerably better, with  $\kappa_{P} / \kappa_{R}$  ranging in value between 1 (for  $\tau_{L} = 0$ ) and 31 ( $\tau_{L} = 100$ ). The semigray approach cannot account for spectral windows, nor for line structure (line overlap parameter  $\beta$ ): If there is little line overlap (small  $\beta$ ) radiation can travel unimpeded through "mini- windows" between strong spectral lines. For a gray gas the heat flux must always tend to zero for optically thick gases.

# 20.4 THE STEPWISE-GRAY MODEL (BOX MODEL)

Another simple way to incorporate the effects of absorption- emission bands of molecular gases in radiative heat transfer calculations is to approximate the band absorptances through the box model described in Section 11.10. In this model the spectral absorption coefficient for a molecular gas with  $N$  vibration- rotation bands is approximated (see Fig. 20- 4) as

$$
\kappa_{\eta}\simeq \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\kappa_{n}\left[H(\eta -\eta_{n} + \frac{1}{2}\Delta \eta_{n}) - H(\eta -\eta_{n} - \frac{1}{2}\Delta \eta_{n})\right], \tag{20.27}
$$

where  $\eta_{n}$  is the wavenumber at the band center,  $\Delta \eta_{n}$  is the band width and  $\kappa_{n}$  is the absorption coefficient of the  $n$ th band (assumed constant for each band). Finally, the function  $H(x)$  is Heaviside's unit step function. If the molecular gas is accompanied by absorbing and/or scattering particles (e.g., soot or ash particles), the absorption coefficient of equation (20.27) must be augmented by the extinction coefficient of the background. If the background material can be approximated as gray, the mixture extinction coefficient may be expressed as

$$
\beta_{\eta} = \beta_{p} + \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\kappa_{n}\left[H(\eta -\eta_{n} + \frac{1}{2}\Delta \eta_{n}) - H(\eta -\eta_{n} - \frac{1}{2}\Delta \eta_{n})\right]. \tag{20.28}
$$

FIGURE 20-4 Box model approximation of molecular gas bands.

A number of researchers have used various forms of the box model to solve nongray radiation problems. Originally proposed by Chandrasekhar [41], the model has primarily been applied to one- dimensional plane media at radiative equilibrium, for example by Siewert and Zweifel [42], Kung and Sibulkin [43], and Reith, Siewert, and Ozisik [44]. Greif [45] applied the method to combined conduction/radiation in a plane layer. Modest [46] showed that, for gases with a single band strength, the box model approach can be incorporated into the  $P_{1}$ - approximation, making multidimensional calculations possible. This was extended to the general box model by Modest and Sikka [39], and a consistent method for the determination of box model parameters was given. The combination of box model and  $P_{1}$ - approximation was also used by Thynell [47] to predict radiation in a one- dimensional cylindrical medium with carbon dioxide, water vapor, soot, and larger particles; similarly, Kaminski and coworkers [48,49] investigated laminar cross flow over a cylinder and turbulent flow through a tube, respectively, for mixtures of combustion products. The method was also employed by Mazumder and Modest to determine the importance of interaction between turbulence and radiation in reacting [50] and nonreacting [51] flows.

Comparing the box model with the mean beam length method, we see that the mean beam length method can model the spectral variations of the absorption coefficient very well, but it is limited to isothermal, black- walled enclosures with nonscattering media. The box model, on the other hand, can handle nonisothermal, scattering media bounded by nonblack walls, while its spectral modeling is rather crude.

How well the box model predicts radiative heat fluxes (or their divergence) for nongray media largely depends on how well "optimum" box parameters are determined for a given medium. To find appropriate values for these parameters, one must realize that the exact integral relationships that govern radiative heat transfer in a participating medium [see, for example, equation (10.28)] contain the spectral absorption coefficient in the form of the spectral emissivity (or its derivative)

$$
\epsilon_{\eta} = 1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}X}. \tag{20.29}
$$

Here  $X = L$  if the linear absorption coefficient is used, or  $L$  multiplied by the partial density or pressure of the absorbing gas if either mass or pressure absorption coefficient is used; and  $L$  is the geometric path length over which absorption/emission is being considered. Spectrally integrated heat fluxes (or their divergence), therefore, depend strongly on the total band absorptances of the medium,

$$
A(X) = \int_{\mathrm{band}}\epsilon_{\eta}d\eta = \int_{\mathrm{band}}(1 - e^{-\kappa_{\eta}X})d\eta . \tag{20.30}
$$

Thus, the aim of the box model must be to approximate the total band absorptance as well as possible for all possible conditions. For a gas without particle background, as shown in Fig. 20- 4,

we have for band  $n$ ,

$$
A_{n}(X)\simeq \Delta \eta_{n}(1 - e^{-\kappa_{n}X}), \tag{20.31}
$$

where  $\Delta \eta_{n}$  and  $\kappa_{n}$  are two parameters that may have arbitrary dependence on all gas conditions (pressure, temperature, line overlap, etc.), except path length  $X$ . Consequently,  $A_{n}(X)$  as calculated by equation (20.31) ranges in value between 0 and  $\Delta \eta_{n}$  and can coincide with the exact value of  $A_{n}(X)$  (as discussed in Chapter 11) for precisely two values of  $X$ . It is this restriction that limits the accuracy of the box model, since the "exact" value of the total band absorptance increases as  $\ln (\kappa_{\eta}X)$  for optically thick conditions (cf. Table 11.2). Modest and Sikka [39] found that best results are obtained by choosing  $\Delta \eta_{n}$  and  $\kappa_{n}$  in such a way that equation (20.31) predicts the correct band absorptance for optically thin situations (  $X$  small) and for a characteristic length  $X_{m}$  based on the mean beam length  $L_{m}$  (as listed in Table 20.1). In the optically thin limit we have

$$
X\ll X_{m}:A_{n}(x) = \int_{\mathrm{band}}\kappa_{\eta}Xd\eta = \alpha_{n}X = \kappa_{n}\Delta \eta_{n}X, \tag{20.32}
$$

where  $\alpha_{n}$  is the integrated absorption coefficient, or

$$
\alpha_{n}\simeq \kappa_{n}\Delta \eta_{n}. \tag{20.33}
$$

At the mean beam length we have

$$
X = X_{m}:A_{n}(X_{m}) = \Delta \eta_{n}(1 - e^{-\kappa_{n}X_{m}}), \tag{20.34}
$$

where  $A_{n}(X_{m})$  must be evaluated from any appropriate wide band model. Equations (20.33) and (20.34) constitute a set of two equations for the unknowns  $\kappa_{n}$  and  $\Delta \eta_{n}$ , which are readily solved, especially if  $\kappa_{n}X_{m} \gg 1$  (which will be the case for most important bands).

As a simple illustration we consider radiative equilibrium in a one- dimensional plane- parallel layer of molecular gases confined between two isothermal, gray- diffuse plates. The medium does not scatter and the absorption coefficient obeys equation (20.27). As a further simplification we assume that all bands are of equal strength, that is,

$$
\kappa_{1} = \kappa_{2} = \dots = \kappa_{N} = \overline{\kappa}, \tag{20.35}
$$

and that the band width  $\Delta \eta_{n}$  does not vary with location or temperature. For this simple case the spectral values for incident radiation,  $G_{\eta}$ , and radiative heat flux,  $q_{\eta}$ , are readily found from equations (14.34) and (14.35) as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{G_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta}) = 2\Big\{J_{1\eta}E_{2}(\tau_{\eta}) + J_{2\eta}E_{2}(\tau_{L\eta} - \tau_{\eta}) + \int_{0}^{\tau_{L}}E_{b\eta}(\tau_{\eta}^{\prime})E_{1}(|\tau_{\eta} - \tau_{\eta}^{\prime}|)d\tau_{\eta}^{\prime}\Big\} ,}\\ {q_{\eta}(\tau_{\eta}) = 2\Big\{J_{1\eta}E_{3}(\tau_{\eta}) - J_{2\eta}E_{3}(\tau_{L\eta} - \tau_{\eta})}\\ {+\int_{0}^{\tau_{L}}E_{b\eta}(\tau_{\eta}^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau_{\eta} - \tau_{\eta}^{\prime})d\tau_{\eta}^{\prime} - \int_{\tau_{\eta}}^{\tau_{L\eta}}E_{b\eta}(\tau_{\eta}^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau_{\eta}^{\prime} - \tau_{\eta})d\tau_{\eta}^{\prime}\Big\} ,} \end{array} \tag{20.37}
$$

where

$$
\tau_{\eta} = \int_{0}^{\tau_{L}}\overline{\kappa} dz\sum_{n = 1}^{N}\left[H(\eta -\eta_{n} + \frac{1}{2}\Delta \eta_{n}) - H(\eta -\eta_{n} - \frac{1}{2}\Delta \eta_{n})\right]
$$

$$
= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\overline{\tau}, & \mathrm{within~bands},\\ 0, & \mathrm{across~windows}. \end{array} \right. \tag{20.38}
$$

Integrating equations (20.36) and (20.37) over all bands (excluding windows) results in

$$
\begin{array}{l}{G_B(\overline{\tau}) = 2\Big\{J_{B1}E_2(\overline{\tau}) + J_{B2}E_2(\overline{\tau}_L - \overline{\tau}) + \int_0^{\overline{\tau}_L}E_B(\overline{\tau} ')E_1(|\overline{\tau} -\overline{\tau} ')|d\overline{\tau} '\Big\} ,}\\ {q_B(\overline{\tau}) = 2\Big\{J_{B1}E_3(\overline{\tau}) - J_{B2}E_3(\overline{\tau}_L - \overline{\tau}) + \int_0^{\overline{\tau}}E_B(\overline{\tau} ')E_2(\overline{\tau} -\overline{\tau} ')d\overline{\tau} ' - \int_{\overline{\tau}}^{\overline{\tau}_L}E_B(\overline{\tau} ')E_2(\overline{\tau} ' - \overline{\tau})d\overline{\tau} '\Big\} ,} \end{array} \tag{20.40}
$$

where the subscript  $B$  denotes a quantity integrated over all bands, for example,

$$
G_{B} = \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\int_{n_{n} - \frac{1}{2}\Delta \eta_{n}}^{\eta +\frac{1}{2}\Delta \eta_{n}}G_{\eta}d\eta . \tag{20.41}
$$

On the other hand, integrating the equation of transfer over the entire spectrum (including windows) gives, from equation (10.60),

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = \frac{dq}{dz} = \int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta}(4E_{b\eta} - G_{\eta})d\eta = \overline{\kappa} (4E_{B} - G_{B}) = 0, \tag{20.42}
$$

where the zero is due to the fact that radiative equilibrium prevails. Since integrating the equation of transfer over the bands only (excluding windows) would have resulted in the identical right- hand side, we conclude that  $dq_{B} / dz = 0$  or  $q_{B} = \mathrm{const},$  and  $G_{B} = 4E_{B}$ . Thus, equations (20.39) and (20.40) are identical to the gray case, equations (14.34) and (14.35), after replacing total values by band- integrated values, or

$$
\Phi_{B} = \frac{E_{B}(\overline{\tau}) - J_{B2}}{J_{B1} - J_{B2}} = \frac{1}{2}\left[E_{2}(\overline{\tau}) + \int_{0}^{\overline{\tau}_{L}}\Phi_{B}(\overline{\tau}^{\prime})E_{1}(|\overline{\tau} -\overline{\tau}^{\prime}|)d\overline{\tau}^{\prime}\right], \tag{20.43}
$$

$$
\Psi_{B} = \frac{q_{B}}{J_{B1} - J_{B2}} = 1 - 2\int_{0}^{\overline{\tau}_{L}}\Phi_{B}(\overline{\tau}^{\prime})E_{2}(\overline{\tau}^{\prime})d\overline{\tau}^{\prime}. \tag{20.44}
$$

The total heat flux between the plates is then determined by adding to this the heat flux over the spectral windows

$$
q_{w} = \int_{\mathrm{windows}}(J_{1\eta} - J_{2\eta})d\eta = J_{1} - J_{2} - (J_{B1} - J_{B2}), \tag{20.45}
$$

or

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{J_1 - J_2} = \frac{q_w + q_B}{J_1 - J_2} = 1 - \frac{J_{B1} - J_{B2}}{J_1 - J_2} (1 - \Psi_B). \tag{20.46}
$$

We note that, for a gray medium,  $\Psi$  varies between 1 (vacuum) and 0 (opaque medium), while the minimum heat flux for a nongray medium is

$$
\Psi_{\mathrm{min}} = 1 - \frac{J_{B1} - J_{B2}}{J_1 - J_2}, \tag{20.47}
$$

since radiation will travel unimpeded from surface to surface over spectral windows, even if the bands are opaque.

Example 20.6. Pure  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  at  $1\mathrm{bar} = 100\mathrm{kPa}$  pressure is confined between two parallel, black plates, spaced  $1\mathrm{m}$  apart, which are kept isothermal at  $T_{1} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  and  $T_{2} = 2000\mathrm{K}$ , respectively. Assuming conduction and convection to be negligible, estimate the radiative heat flux between the two plates.

# Solution

From Table 11.3 we find that carbon dioxide has three important bands in the infrared: at  $3660\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ $(2.7\mu \mathrm{m})$ ,  $2410\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ $(4.3\mu \mathrm{m})$ , and  $667\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ $(15\mu \mathrm{m})$ . Since the walls are at 1000 and  $2000\mathrm{K}$ , respectively, the most important wavelength regime will be between approximately  $1\mu \mathrm{m}$  and  $4\mu \mathrm{m}$  (Wien's displacement law, Chapter 1). At first glance it would appear that the  $2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  band is the most important. However, the  $4.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band is approximately 20 times stronger and, therefore, should be modeled most accurately. Before we can employ the box model we must find suitable box parameters for these bands. We shall do this by comparing the band absorptances of the box model with those of the (more accurate) exponential wide band model [39], by applying equations (20.33) and (20.34). Since we should like to use a single  $\overline{\kappa}$  for all bands we cannot use all of these conditions, and shall apply equation (20.34) only for the (most important)  $4.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band. Thus,

$$
\overline{\kappa}\Delta \eta_{i} = \alpha_{i},\quad \mathrm{for~all~three~bands},
$$

$$
\Delta \eta_{4.3} = A_{4.3}(X_m),\quad \mathrm{for~the~}4.3\mu \mathrm{m~band}.
$$

In the last relation we have assumed  $\overline{\kappa} X_{m}\gg 1$ , which needs to be verified.

To simplify the analysis further we shall calculate the box model parameters at a single temperature, say  $T_{\mathrm{av}}^4 = (T_1^4 +T_2^4) / 2$  or  $T_{\mathrm{av}}\simeq 1700\mathrm{K}$ . With a gas constant of  $R = 0.18892\mathrm{kJ / kgK}$  for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  [52] and the data in Table 11.3, and Fig. 11- 24 we get

$2.7\mu \mathrm{m}$  band:

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\rho_{\mathrm{CO_2}} = p / RT = 100\mathrm{kPa} / (0.18892\times 1700\mathrm{kJ / kg}) = 311.4\mathrm{g / m^3},}\\ & {\alpha_{\rho \mathrm{CO_2}} = \alpha_0(\alpha /\alpha_0)\rho = 4.0\times 1.61\times 311.4 = 2005\mathrm{cm^{-1} / m},}\\ & {\omega = 23.5\times \sqrt{17} = 96.9\mathrm{cm^{-1}},}\\ & {\alpha \rho_{\mathrm{CO_2}} = 110.0\times 1\times 311.4 = 34,254\mathrm{cm^{-1} / m},}\\ & {\omega = 11.2\times \sqrt{17} = 46.2\mathrm{cm^{-1}},}\\ & {\gamma = \gamma_0(\gamma /\gamma_0) = 0.247\times 24.8 = 6.12,}\\ & {P_e = 1.3^{0.8} = 1.234,\beta = 6.12\times 1.234 = 7.55,}\\ & {\alpha \rho_{\mathrm{CO_2}} = 19.0\times 1\times 311.4 = 5917\mathrm{cm^{-1} / m},}\\ & {\omega = 12.7\times \sqrt{17} = 52.4\mathrm{cm^{-1}}.} \end{array}
$$

$4.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band:

$15\mu \mathrm{m}$  band:

With an average mean beam length of  $L_{m} = 1.76\times 1\mathrm{m} = 1.76\mathrm{m}$ , we obtain for the important  $4.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band from Table 11.3

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\Delta \eta_{4.3} = A_{4.3} = \omega_{4.3}\left[\ln \frac{\alpha_{4.3}\rho_{\mathrm{CO_2}}L_m}{\omega_{4.3}} +1\right]}\\ & {\qquad = 46.2\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\left[\ln \frac{34,254\times 1.76}{46.2} +1\right] = 377.6\mathrm{cm}^{-1},} \end{array}
$$

and

$$
\overline{\kappa} = \left(\alpha \rho_{\mathrm{CO_2}} / \Delta \eta\right)_{4.3} = 34,254 / 377.6 = 90.7\mathrm{m}^{-1} = 0.907\mathrm{cm}^{-1}.
$$

Noting that  $\overline{\kappa}$  is a linear absorption coefficient, and multiplying with  $L_{m}$ , we find  $\overline{\kappa} L_{m} = 0.907\times 176 = 160\gg 1$ , so neglecting the exponential in equation (20.34) was indeed justified.

The widths of the other two bands follow from the same relationship as

$$
\begin{array}{r}\Delta \eta_{2.7} = \alpha_{2.7}\rho_{\mathrm{CO_2}} / \overline{\kappa} = 2005 / 90.7 = 22.1\mathrm{cm}^{-1},\\ \Delta \eta_{15} = \alpha_{15}\rho_{\mathrm{CO_2}} / \overline{\kappa} = 5917 / 90.7 = 65.2\mathrm{cm}^{-1}. \end{array}
$$

We are now in a position to calculate the nondimensional heat flux between the plates from equation (20.46) with  $\overline{\tau} = \overline{\kappa} L = 90.7$ .  $\Psi_{B}(\overline{\tau})$  obeys the same equation as  $\Psi_{b}(\tau)$  in Chapter 14 and, thus, may be evaluated from Table 14.1. Since the bands are essentially opaque we find  $\Psi_{B} = 0.015\ll 1$ , and

$$
\Psi = 1 - 0.985\frac{E_{B1} - E_{B2}}{E_{b1} - E_{b2}}\simeq 1 - \frac{0.985}{E_{b1} - E_{b2}}\sum_{n = 1}^{3}(E_{b\eta_{n,1}} - E_{b\eta_{n,2}})\Delta \eta_{n},
$$

where radiosity is replaced by emissive power for the black- walled enclosure, and we assume that the bands are narrow (to justify evaluation of  $E_{B}$  as the value at band center  $\times$  band width). To look up values for spectral emissive power in Appendix C, we write with  $\eta_{2.7} = 3660\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ,  $\eta_{4.3}\simeq 10^{4} / 4.3 = 2326\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  (since the  $4.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band is a band with head, it is better to evaluate  $E_{b\eta}$  near the center of the band), and  $\eta_{15} = 667\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\Psi = 1 - \frac{0.985}{\sigma(T_1^4 - T_2^4)}\sum_{n = 1}^{3}\left[\frac{E_{b\eta}(\eta_n / T_1)}{T_1^3} T_1^3 -\frac{E_{b\eta}(\eta_n / T_2)}{T_2^3} T_2^3\right]\Delta \eta_n}\\ {= 1 - \frac{0.985}{5.670\times 10^{-8}(1000^4 - 2000^4)}\times \left[(0.9523\times 10^{-8 + 9} - 1.7747\times 2^3\times 10)\times 22.1\right.}\\ {\left. + \left(1.7157\times 10 - 1.3589\times 2^3\times 10\right)\times 377.6 + \left(0.6885\times 10 - 0.2251\times 2^3\times 10\right)\times 65.2\right]}\\ {= 0.956.} \end{array}
$$

Thus, the heat flux is reduced only by  $4.7\%$ , as compared with the no- gas case, to

$$
q = 0.956\times 5.670\times 10^{-8}(2000^{4} - 1000^{4}) = 813,000\mathrm{W / m^{2}} = 81.3\mathrm{W / cm^{2}}.
$$

Note that, since all bands are essentially opaque, the (somewhat arbitrary) choice for band widths is of extreme importance in this model.

# The  $P_{1}$ -Approximation for Radiative Equilibrium in a Gas with Single Band Strength

The method discussed in the previous section enables us to calculate heat transfer rates for a nongray medium at radiative equilibrium in a simple way. Unfortunately, the method is limited to one- dimensional plane- parallel media. Following the treatment of Modest [46], we shall now show that the same box- model absorption coefficient may also be applied to the  $P_{1}$  or differential approximation, making solutions for arbitrary multidimensional geometries possible.

The governing equations for the  $P_{1}$ - approximation, on a spectral basis and for a nonscattering medium, are, from Section 16.5

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}_{\eta} = \kappa_{\eta}(4E_{b\eta} - G_{\eta}),}\\ {\nabla G_{\eta} = -3\kappa_{\eta}\mathbf{q}_{\eta},} \end{array} \tag{20.49}
$$

subject to the boundary condition

$$
2\mathbf{q}_{\eta}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = 4J_{w\eta} - G_{\eta}. \tag{20.50}
$$

Assuming again that the absorption coefficient may be approximated by equation (20.35), we integrate equation (20.48) over the entire spectrum, and over all bands only, resulting in

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}_B = \overline{\kappa} (4E_B - G_B) = 0, \tag{20.51}
$$

where the zero is again due to the fact that radiative equilibrium is assumed. Now, integrating equations (20.49) and (20.50) over all bands gives

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\nabla G_B = -3\overline{\kappa}\mathbf{q}_B,}\\ {2\mathbf{q}_B\cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}} = 4J_{Bw} - G_B.} \end{array} \tag{20.53}
$$

The heat flux may be eliminated from these equations, leading to a single elliptic equation in  $G_{B}$  as

$$
\nabla_{\overline{\tau}}^{2}G_{B} = 0, \tag{20.54}
$$

with boundary condition

$$
-\textstyle \frac{2}{3}\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \nabla_{\overline{\tau}}G_{B} + G_{B} = 4J_{Bw}, \tag{20.55}
$$

where the subscript  $\overline{\tau}$  indicates that the gradients are with respect to optical coordinates  $d\overline{\tau} = \overline{\kappa} ds$ . Once the band- integrated incident radiation,  $G_{B}$ , has been determined, the heat flux for the gas bands follows as

$$
\mathbf{q}_B = -\frac{1}{3}\nabla_{\overline{\tau}}G_B. \tag{20.56}
$$

Finally, to calculate total heat transfer rates, the heat fluxes through the optical windows,  $\mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{w}}$ , must be determined independently through standard methods (Chapters 5 and 6), as indicated in the previous section for one- dimensional, plane- parallel media, equation (20.45).

Example 20.7. Repeat Example 20.6 using the differential approximation.

# Solution

Since we use the same box model as in the previous example to approximate the absorption coefficient, we shall again use  $\overline{\kappa} = 0.907\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ $\Delta \eta_{2.7} = 22.1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ $\Delta \eta_{4.3} = 377.6\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  , and  $\Delta \eta_{15} = 65.2\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  . Equations (20.51) through (20.53) or equations (20.54) and (20.55) are identical to the general  $P_{1}$  - approximation for gray media (except for the added subscript  $B$  ). Thus, for radiative equilibrium in a one- dimensional plane- parallel medium

$$
\Psi_{B} = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{3}{4}\overline{\tau}} = 0.015.
$$

The heat flux over the spectral windows is, of course, the same as calculated for the previous example, as is the expression for total heat flux, equation (20.46). We conclude that the heat flux evaluation using the  $P_{1}$  - approximation gives the identical result as the exact 2 method.

Both the exact method for one- dimensional plane- parallel media and the  $P_{1}$  - approximation for general geometries are readily extended to the general box model in which the extinction coefficient is approximated by equation (20.28), including nongray backgrounds, as developed by Modest and Sikka [39].

# 20.5 GENERAL BAND MODEL FORMULATION

While the stepwise- gray model is very convenient, it is unfortunately not necessarily very accurate. We have already seen that the rather arbitrary choice for the band width can introduce serious errors. In addition, there are situations in which even the most careful choice for the band width leads to unacceptable results. Consider, for example, flow of an absorbing/emitting gas inside a tube. Let the gas temperature be equal to the surface temperature at the wall (no slip) and hotter inside. The gas will emit and absorb radiation over the spectral regions of its vibration- rotation bands, and there will be no net radiative heat flux over the spectral regions of the windows. If the radius of the tube is sufficiently large and the box model is employed, such that  $\overline{\kappa} R\gg 1,$  then the spectral heat flux for the bands will also vanish as a result of the diffusion limit (since there is no temperature discontinuity). Thus, the stepwise- gray model predicts a zero total radiative heat flux for this case, which is clearly not realistic. The reason for this error is that the box model cannot take into account the effects of the exponentially decaying band wings of a vibration- rotation band: No matter how optically thick the band center is, there will always be a portion of the band wings that has an intermediate optical thickness and, thus, contributes strongly to the radiative heat flux.

In this section we will use the band models of Chapter 11 (narrow band models, wide band models, and the resulting emissivities) to formulate the solutions for spectrally integrated intensities, incident radiation, and radiative heat fluxes for an absorbing/emitting medium; the absorption coefficient of the medium may have arbitrary functional form (although we shall look also at the important special cases of molecular gases and particulate suspensions), and the geometry may be arbitrary and multidimensional. The development will be limited to nonscattering media confined between black walls because of the limitations inherent to the band models. While these formulations are not as general as one would like, they do have a number of important applications, most notably heat transfer within combustion chambers, where the medium consists of combustion gases and (nonscattering) soot, and where the walls are soot covered (and nearly black).

The equation of transfer for the radiative intensity at a wavenumber  $\eta$  and along a path s is, for a nonscattering medium, from equation (10.21),

$$
\frac{dI_{\eta}}{ds} = \kappa_{\eta}(I_{b\eta} - I_{\eta}), \tag{20.57}
$$

FIGURE 20-5 Spectral intensity within an arbitrary black-walled enclosure.

with the formal solution, equation (10.29),

$$
I_{\eta}(s) = I_{bw\eta}\exp \left(-\int_0^s\kappa_\eta ds'\right) + \int_0^s I_{b\eta}(s')\exp \left(-\int_{s'}^s\kappa_\eta ds''\right)\kappa_\eta (s')ds', \tag{20.58}
$$

where  $I_{bw\eta} = I_{b\eta}(T_w)$  is the intensity emitted into the medium from the (black) wall at  $s = 0$ , as shown in Fig. 20- 5. Integrating this expression over the entire spectrum, we obtain the total intensity as

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{{I(s)=\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{\eta}d\eta=\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b w\eta}\exp\left(-\int_{0}^{s}\kappa_{\eta}d s^{\prime}\right)d\eta}}\\ &{}&{+\int_{0}^{s}\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}(s^{\prime})\exp\left(-\int_{s^{\prime}}^{s}\kappa_{\eta}d s^{\prime\prime}\right)\kappa_{\eta}(s^{\prime})d\eta d s^{\prime}.}\end{array} \tag{20.59}
$$

In Sections 10.2 and 10.3 we defined the spectral absorptivity and emissivity of a participating medium as

$$
a_{\eta}(0\to s) = \epsilon_{\eta}(0\to s) = 1 - \exp \left(-\int_{0}^{s}\kappa_{\eta}ds^{\prime}\right). \tag{20.60}
$$

For a constant absorption coefficient the absorptivity depends on the thickness of the gas layer as well as the (constant) absorption coefficient. If  $\kappa_{\eta}$  is not constant but varies spatially and/or with temperature, the absorptivity depends on the variation of  $\kappa_{\eta}$  along the entire path, here denoted by the argument  $0\to s$ . Substituting equation (20.60) into (20.59), and using

$$
\frac{\partial\alpha_{\eta}}{\partial s^{\prime}} (s^{\prime}\rightarrow s) = \frac{\partial}{\partial s^{\prime}}\left[1 - \exp \left(-\int_{s^{\prime}}^{s}\kappa_{\eta}ds^{\prime \prime}\right)\right] = -\kappa_{\eta}(s^{\prime})\exp \left(-\int_{s^{\prime}}^{s}\kappa_{\eta}ds^{\prime \prime}\right) \tag{20.61}
$$

where Leibniz's rule was used for the differentiation of an integral, we get

$$
I(s) = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{bw\eta}\left[1 - \alpha_{\eta}(0\to s)\right]d\eta -\int_{0}^{s}\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}(s^{\prime})\frac{\partial\alpha_{\eta}}{\partial s^{\prime}} (s^{\prime}\to s)d\eta ds^{\prime}. \tag{20.62}
$$

Physically, the first term represents transmitted radiation from the wall, and the second term augmentation due to emission along the path  $s$ . With the definition of the total absorptivity as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\alpha (T,s^{\prime}\to s) = \frac{1}{I_b(T)}\int_0^{\infty}\alpha_\eta (s^{\prime}\to s)I_{b\eta}(T)d\eta}\\ {= \frac{1}{I_b(T)}\int_0^{\infty}\left[1 - \exp \left(-\int_{s^{\prime}}^{s}\kappa_\eta ds^{\prime \prime}\right)\right]I_{b\eta}(T)d\eta ,} \end{array} \tag{20.63}
$$

we may consolidate equation (20.62) as<sup>5</sup>

$$
I(s) = [1 - \alpha (T_w,0\rightarrow s)]I_{bw} - \int_0^s\frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial s'} [T(s'),s'\rightarrow s]I_b(s')ds'. \tag{20.64}
$$

To determine total heat flux, the total intensity must be integrated over all directions, after multiplication with the unit vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , or

$$
{\mathfrak{q}}=\int_{0}^{\infty}{\mathfrak{q}}_{\eta}d\eta=\int_{4\pi}I{\mathfrak{s}}d\Omega. \tag{20.65}
$$

To evaluate the divergence of the radiative heat flux (for a known temperature field) or the temperature field (for radiative equilibrium), the equation governing conservation of radiative energy must be integrated over all wavenumbers or, from equation (10.60),

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = \nabla \cdot \int_{0}^{\infty}\mathbf{q}_{\eta}d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta}\left(4\pi I_{b\eta} - \int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}d\Omega\right)d\eta}\\ {= 4\pi \kappa_{P}I_{b} - \int_{4\pi}\left(\int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta}I_{\eta}d\eta\right)d\Omega ,} \end{array} \tag{20.66}
$$

where  $\kappa_{P}$  is the Planck- mean absorption coefficient first defined in equation (11.182). Thus, multiplying equation (20.58) by  $\kappa_{\eta}(s)$  and integrating, we get

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{{\int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta}(s)I_{\eta}(s)d\eta=\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b w\eta}\kappa_{\eta}(s)\exp\left(-\int_{0}^{s}\kappa_{\eta}d s^{\prime\prime}\right)d\eta}}\\ &{}&{+\int_{0}^{s}\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}(s^{\prime})\exp\left(-\int_{s^{\prime}}^{s}\kappa_{\eta}d s^{\prime\prime}\right)\kappa_{\eta}(s^{\prime})\kappa_{\eta}(s)d\eta d s^{\prime}.}\end{array} \tag{20.67}
$$

Differentiating equation (20.61) with respect to  $s$ , again using Leibniz's rule, leads to

$$
\frac{\partial^2\alpha_{\eta}}{\partial s\partial s'} (s'\rightarrow s) = \kappa_{\eta}(s')\kappa_{\eta}(s)\exp \left(-\int_{s'}^s\kappa_{\eta}ds''\right). \tag{20.68}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\eta}I_{\eta}d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{bw\eta}\frac{\partial\alpha_{\eta}}{\partial s} (0\rightarrow s)d\eta +\int_{0}^{s}\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{bw\eta}(s')\frac{\partial^{2}\alpha_{\eta}}{\partial s\partial s'} (s'\rightarrow s)d\eta ds'}\\ {= \frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial s} (T_{w},0\rightarrow s)I_{bw} + \int_{0}^{s}\frac{\partial^{2}\alpha}{\partial s\partial s'} [T(s'),s'\rightarrow s]I_{b}(s')ds'.} \end{array} \tag{20.69}
$$

The functional form of  $\alpha (T, s' \rightarrow s)$  depends, of course, on the local properties of the participating medium. We shall briefly discuss the special cases of pure gas and gas- particulate mixtures.

# Pure Molecular Gas

For a pure gas the total absorptivity needed in equations (20.65) and (20.66) can be calculated from a narrow band model, a wide band model, or from a total absorptivity correlation. Narrow band calculations are potentially the most accurate, provided an accurate database is used, such as the RADCAL [53, 54] (based on experimental data) and EM2C [55] (calculated from high- resolution data) databases. However, they require a few hundred to thousands of spectral evaluations. Some results for one- dimensional slabs were obtained by Menart and colleagues [56- 58], the latter two papers overcoming the black- wall limitation of the narrow band

model, by expanding wall radiosities into infinite series (for multiple reflections). Cherkaoui and coworkers [59] used an approach similar to [57] to determine direct exchange factors (for use with the zonal method of Chapter 18) in a one- dimensional slab with reflecting walls. Multidimensional calculations were primarily carried out by the group around Liu [60- 62] for various combustion scenarios. All of the here- cited works used the Malkmus model together with the EM2C database and its predecessors.

If the wide band model is to be used for a gas with  $N$  vibration- rotation bands, the absorption coefficient may be stated as

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\kappa_{n\eta}. \tag{20.70}
$$

To allow the use of wide band correlations it is also assumed that each band is fairly narrow, i.e., that the blackbody intensity does not vary appreciably over each band, and that the bands do not overlap. Then the total absorptivity may be evaluated as

$$
\alpha (T,s^{\prime}\rightarrow s)\simeq \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\frac{\omega_{n}I_{b\eta_{n}}}{I_{b}} (T)\frac{1}{\omega_{n}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\left[1 - \exp \left(-\int_{s^{\prime}}^{s}\kappa_{n\eta}ds^{\prime \prime}\right)\right]d\eta = \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\frac{\omega_{n}I_{b\eta_{n}}}{I_{b}} (T)A_{n}^{*}(s^{\prime}\rightarrow s), \tag{20.71}
$$

where  $I_{b\eta_{n}}$  is the Planck function at the center of band  $n$ ,  $\omega_{n}$  is the band width parameter, and  $A_{n}^{*}$  is the nondimensional band absorptance, as discussed in detail in Chapter 11.

# Molecular Gas with Suspended Particles

If the molecular gas contains a suspension of nonscattering particles, the absorption coefficient may be written as

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \kappa_{p\eta} + \kappa_{g\eta} = \kappa_{p\eta} + \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\kappa_{n\eta}. \tag{20.72}
$$

We shall now assume that, not only are the gas bands narrow and nonoverlapping, but also that the absorption coefficient of the particles,  $\kappa_{p\eta}$ , does not vary appreciably over each band. Then

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\alpha (T,s^{\prime}\rightarrow s) = \frac{1}{I_b(T)}\int_0^{\infty}\left[1 - \exp \left(-\int_{s^{\prime}}^{s}\kappa_{p\eta}ds^{\prime \prime}\right)\exp \left(-\int_{s^{\prime}}^{s}\kappa_{g\eta}ds^{\prime \prime}\right)\right]I_{b\eta}(T)d\eta}\\ & {\quad \quad = \frac{1}{I_b(T)}\int_0^{\infty}\left[1 - \exp \left(-\int_{s^{\prime}}^{s}\kappa_{p\eta}ds^{\prime \prime}\right)\right]I_{b\eta}(T)d\eta}\\ & {\quad \quad +\frac{1}{I_b(T)}\int_0^{\infty}\exp \left(-\int_{s^{\prime}}^{s}\kappa_{p\eta}ds^{\prime \prime}\right)\left[1 - \exp \left(-\int_{s^{\prime}}^{s}\kappa_{g\eta}ds^{\prime \prime}\right)\right]I_{b\eta}(T)d\eta .} \end{array} \tag{20.73}
$$

The first term in equation (20.73) is simply the absorptivity for the particle background (without molecular gas). In the second spectral integral we note that the integrand is nonzero only when  $\kappa_{g\eta}$  is nonzero, i.e., over the vibration- rotation bands of the gas. Since we assume the gas bands to be spectrally narrow, the particle attenuation term may be evaluated at the band center and taken outside the spectral integral. Then

$$
\alpha (T,s^{\prime}\rightarrow s)\simeq \alpha_{p}(T,s^{\prime}\rightarrow s) + \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\frac{\omega_{n}I_{b\eta_{n}}}{I_{b}} (T)\exp \left(-\int_{s^{\prime}}^{s}\kappa_{p\eta_{n}}ds^{\prime \prime}\right)A_{n}^{*}(s^{\prime}\rightarrow s). \tag{20.74}
$$

# Radiative Equilibrium

In the case of radiative equilibrium equation (20.69) is used to determine the temperature field. Substituting the result into equation (20.66), with  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = 0$ , yields

$$
4\pi \kappa_{P}I_{b} = \int_{4\pi}\left[\frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial s} (T_{w},0\rightarrow s)I_{bw} + \int_{0}^{s}\frac{\partial^{2}\alpha}{\partial s\partial s^{\prime}} [T(s^{\prime}),s^{\prime}\rightarrow s]I_{b}(s^{\prime})ds^{\prime}\right]d\Omega . \tag{20.75}
$$

This is a single (but rather complicated) integral equation for the unknown temperature. Once the temperature field is known, the heat flux follows from equations (20.65) and (20.64) as

$$
{\mathfrak{q}}=\int_{4\pi}[1-\alpha(T_w,0\to s)]I_{bw}-\int_0^s\frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial s^{\prime}}[T(s^{\prime}),s^{\prime}\to s]I_b(s^{\prime})ds^{\prime}]\mathfrak{s}d\Omega. \tag{20.76}
$$

In equations (20.75) and (20.76) the absorptivities and their derivatives are obtained from equation (20.71) (pure molecular gas) or (20.74) (gas- particulate mixture).

# Medium with Known Temperature Field

If the temperature field is known, the local heat flux may be determined from equation (20.76), while the divergence of the heat flux follows from equations (20.66) and (20.69) as

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = 4\pi \kappa_{P}I_{b} - \int_{4\pi}\left[\frac{\partial\alpha}{\partial s} (T_{w},0\rightarrow s)I_{bw} + \int_{0}^{s}\frac{\partial^{2}\alpha}{\partial s\partial s^{\prime}} [T(s^{\prime}),s^{\prime}\rightarrow s]I_{b}(s^{\prime})ds^{\prime}\right]d\Omega . \tag{22}
$$

Again, the absorptivities and their derivatives are obtained from equations (20.71) (pure molecular gas) or (20.74) (gas- particulate mixture).

The general relationships developed in this section will be employed over the following two sections to carry out heat transfer calculations. First we shall look in some detail at radiative transfer within an isothermal, one- dimensional nongray medium. Then follows a section describing how the concept of a weighted- sum- of- gray- gases can be applied to the general nongray medium problem.

# The Wide Band Model for Isothermal Media

For an isothermal medium, we assume that the absorption coefficient is a function of temperature only (and is, therefore, constant throughout the medium). The definition of the total absorptivity, equation (20.63), keeping in mind that the absorption coefficient depends on  $T_{m}$ , while the Planck function may be evaluated at medium or wall temperature, then simplifies to

$$
\alpha (T,T_m,s) = \frac{1}{I_b(T)}\int_0^\infty \left(1 - e^{-\kappa_\eta (T_m)s}\right)I_{b\eta}(T)d\eta , \tag{20.78}
$$

that is, the total absorptivity no longer depends on the entire path, but only on the path length itself. If  $T = T_{w}$ , equation (20.78) gives the absorption of wall emission along the path  $s$ , while for  $T = T_{m}$  equation (20.78) represents the total emissivity

$$
\epsilon (T_m,s) = \frac{1}{I_b(T_m)}\int_0^\infty \left(1 - e^{-\kappa_\eta (T_m)s}\right)I_{b\eta}(T_m)d\eta . \tag{20.79}
$$

Similarly, the nondimensional band absorptance of molecular gases now depends only on the optical path length (as well as a line overlap parameter), as discussed in Chapter 11, or

$$
A_{n}^{*}(s^{\prime}\rightarrow s) = A^{*}[\kappa_{n}(s - s^{\prime}),\beta_{n}], \tag{20.80}
$$

where  $\kappa_{n} = \rho_{a}\alpha_{n} / \omega_{n}$  is the gas absorption coefficient at the band center or band head, $^{7}$  and  $\beta_{n}$  is the overlap parameter, all evaluated at  $T_{m}$ . Equation (20.64) then reduces for an isothermal medium to

$$
I(s) = [1 - \alpha (T_w,T_m,s)]I_{bw} + \epsilon (T_m,s)I_{bm}, \tag{20.81}
$$

where  $I_{bm} = I_b(T_m)$  and  $T_{m}$  is the (constant) temperature of the medium.

Example 20.8. Consider a  $1\mathrm{m}$  thick isothermal layer of pure  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  at a pressure of  $100\mathrm{kPa}$  and a temperature of  $1700\mathrm{K}$ . The gas is confined between two parallel, cold, black plates. Calculate the radiative transfer from the gas to the walls using the exponential wide band model.

# Solution

For a slab  $0< z< L$  the intensity as given by equation (20.81) may emanate from either of the two bounding surfaces. Splitting intensity into  $I^{+}$  and  $I^{- }$  ("positive" and "negative" directions), as was done in Section 14.2, leads to  $s = z / \mu$  for "positive" directions  $(0< \mu < 1)$  and the  $s = - (L - z) / \mu$  for "negative" directions  $(- 1< \mu < 0)$ , as shown in Fig. 14- 1. Substituting into equation (20.81) results in

$$
\begin{array}{r l r} & {I^{+}(z) = \big[1 - \alpha (T_{w},T_{m},z / \mu)\big]I_{b w} + \epsilon (T_{m},z / \mu)I_{b m},} & {0< \mu < 1,}\\ & {I^{-}(z) = \big[1 - \alpha \big(T_{w},T_{m}, - (L - z) / \mu \big)\big]I_{b w} + \epsilon \big(T_{m}, - (L - z) / \mu \big)I_{b m},} & {-1< \mu < 0.} \end{array}
$$

The local heat flux is then determined from

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q(z) = 2\pi \left[\int_{-1}^{0}I^{\mu}d\mu +\int_{0}^{+1}I^{+}\mu d\mu \right]}\\ {= 2\pi \left\{\int_{0}^{1}\left[\epsilon \left(T_{m},\frac{z}{\mu}\right) - \epsilon \left(T_{m},\frac{L - z}{\mu}\right)\right]\mu d\mu I_{b}(T_{m})\right.}\\ {\left. - \int_{0}^{1}\left[\alpha \left(T_{w},T_{m},\frac{z}{\mu}\right) - \alpha \left(T_{w},T_{m},\frac{L - z}{\mu}\right)\right]\mu d\mu I_{b}(T_{w})\right\} .} \end{array}
$$

If the medium is a molecular gas, equation (20.71) is substituted into this expression. Using emissive powers in favor of intensities,  $E_{b\eta} = \pi I_{b\eta}$ , then leads to

$$
q(z) = \sum_{n = 1}^{N}\omega_{n}\big[E_{b\eta_{n}}(T_{m}) - E_{b\eta_{n}}(T_{w})\big]\big[A_{s}(\kappa_{n}z,\beta_{n}) - A_{s}(\kappa_{n}(L - z),\beta_{n})\big],
$$

where  $A_{s}$ , termed slab band absorptance by Edwards and Balakrishnan [63], is defined as

$$
A_{s}(\tau ,\beta) = 2\int_{0}^{1}A^{*}\left(\frac{\tau}{\mu},\beta\right)\mu d\mu . \tag{20.82}
$$

The slab band absorptance may be evaluated explicitly for a number of band absorptance correlations, such as the Edwards and Menard correlation of Table 11.2 and the high- pressure limit given by equation (11.155), and must be evaluated numerically for more involved correlations such as the ones by Felske and Tien, equation (11.156), and Wang, equation (11.158). The line overlap parameter  $\beta$  was already calculated for the most important  $4.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band in Example 20.6  $(\beta_{4.3} = 7.55)$ , and is substantially larger than unity for all bands. Thus, the high- pressure limit may be used, and we shall only consider the high- pressure limit  $(\beta \rightarrow \infty)$  here,

$$
A^{*}(\tau ,\infty) = E_{1}(\tau) + \ln \tau +\gamma_{E},
$$

or

$$
A_{s}(\tau ,\infty) = 2\int_{0}^{1}\left[E_{1}\left(\frac{\tau}{\mu}\right) + \ln \frac{\tau}{\mu} +\gamma_{E}\right]\mu d\mu .
$$

Integrating by parts we obtain, with  $E_{1}^{\prime}(x) = - E_{0}(x) = e^{- x} / x,$

$$
A_{s}(\tau ,\infty) = \mu^{2}\left[E_{1}\left(\frac{\tau}{\mu}\right) + \ln \frac{\tau}{\mu} +\gamma_{E}\right]\left|_{0}^{1} - \int_{0}^{1}\mu^{2}\left(\frac{\tau}{\mu^{2}}\frac{e^{-\tau / \mu}}{\tau / \mu} -\frac{1}{\mu}\right)d\mu ,\right.
$$

or

$$
A_{s}(\tau ,\infty) = E_{1}(\tau) + \ln \tau +\gamma_{E} + \frac{1}{2} -E_{3}(\tau). \tag{20.83}
$$

Calculating  $q$  at  $z = L$  for the three important  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  bands, we obtain [with  $T_{w} = 0$  and  $A_{s}(0,\beta) = 0$ ]

$$
q_{n}(L) = \omega_{n}E_{b\eta_{n}}(T_{m})A_{s}\bigg(\frac{\alpha_{n}\rho_{\mathrm{CO_{2}}}}{\omega_{n}} L,\beta \bigg).
$$

All required terms have already been calculated in the previous example, and we find the following:8

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {2.7\mu \mathrm{m}\mathrm{band}\colon}\\ & {\qquad a_{2.7}\rho_{\mathrm{CO_2}}L / \omega_{2.7} = 2005\times 1 / 96.9 = 20.69}\\ & {\qquad A_{12.7}(20.69,\infty) = E_1(20.69) + \ln 20.69 + 0.5772 + 0.5 - E_3(20.69) = 4.107}\\ & {\qquad q_{2.7}(L) = 1.7649\times 10^{-8}\times 1700^3\times 96.9\times 4.107 = 34,508\mathrm{W / m^2};} \end{array}
$$

$4.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  band:

$$
a_{43}\rho_{\mathrm{CO_2}}L / a_{43} = 34,254\times 1 / 46.2 = 741.43
$$

$$
A_{s,1s}(741.43,\infty) = E_1(741.43) + \ln 741.43 + 0.5772 + 0.5 - E_3(741.43) = 7.686
$$

$$
q_{43}(L) = 1.5548\times 10^{-8}\times 1700^{3}\times 46.2\times 7.686 = 27,125\mathrm{W / m}^{2};
$$

$15\mu \mathrm{m}$  band:

$$
\alpha_{15}\rho_{\mathrm{CO_2}}L / \omega_{15} = 5917\times 1 / 52.4 = 112.92\\ A_{s,1s}(112.92,\infty) = E_1(112.92) + \ln 112.92 + 0.5772 + 0.5 - E_3(112.92) = 5.804
$$

$$
q_{15}(L) = 0.2979\times 10^{-8}\times 1700^{3}\times 52.4\times 5.804 = 4805\mathrm{W / m}^{2}.
$$

Finally, the total heat loss from the gas is

$$
q = 2\times [34,508 + 27,125 + 4805] = 13.29\mathrm{W / cm}^2.
$$

Comparison with Example 20.2 shows that the present results agree excellently with those of the mean beam length method.

A number of investigators have obtained exact wide band model solutions to the relatively simple problems of one- dimensional isothermal media. Edwards and Balakrishnan [63] found expressions for the heat flux in an isothermal gas slab and gave results for the high- pressure limit (strong spectral line overlap). Edwards [64] gave an expression for the heat loss from an isothermal gas sphere, while heat loss from an isothermal gas cylinder was discussed by Wassel and Edwards [65]. More recent wide band calculations have been done by Kim and coworkers [56] for a one- dimensional slab containing water vapor (to compare with their narrow band calculations). The wide band approach was also used by Hutchison and Richards [66] investigating combined conduction and radiation in a layer containing  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ , again treating reflection walls by expanding radiosities into infinite series. Calculations for gases with suspended particles have been carried out by Modest [67] (general wide band formulation with nongray particles), Cumber and coworkers [68] (applying the Goody model together with the RADCAL database to a jet flame with water vapor,  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ , and soot), Liu and colleagues [69] (three- dimensional mixtures of water vapor,  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ , and alumina particles, using the EM2C database), and Maruyama and Guo [70] (three- dimensional furnace with water vapor,  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ , and carbon particles, using a spectral version of the wide band model combined with the Elsasser narrow band model). The latter two papers attempt to overcome the no- scattering limitation of the band models.

# 20.6 THE WEIGHTED-SUM-OF-GRAY-GASES (WSGG) MODEL

The concept of a weighted- sum- of- gray- gases approach was first presented by Hottel [29] within the framework of the zonal method, which is described in detail in Chapter 18. Modest [40] has demonstrated that this approach can be applied to the directional equation of transfer,

equation (20.57), and, therefore, to any solution method for the equation of transfer (exact,  $P_N$ - approximation, discrete ordinates method, etc.), provided all boundaries are black and the medium is nonscattering. In this method the nongray gas is replaced by a number of gray gases, for which the heat transfer rates are calculated independently. The total heat flux is then found by adding the heat fluxes of the gray gases after multiplication with certain weight factors.

As a starting point consider equation (20.64). For mathematical simplicity we shall limit ourselves here to a spatially constant (or averaged) absorption coefficient, which may, however, vary across the spectrum. Such an absorption coefficient no longer depends on the local temperature, although the choice for an appropriate constant value will be based on the overall temperature field in the medium. Thus, we have for the spectrally- integrated intensity

$$
I(s) = [1 - \alpha (T_w,s)]I_{bw} - \int_0^\infty \frac{\partial\epsilon}{\partial s'} [T(s'),s - s']I_b(s')ds', \tag{20.84}
$$

where the expressions for total absorptivity and emissivity are similar to the ones developed for an isothermal medium, equation (20.78),

$$
\epsilon (T,s) = \frac{1}{I_b(T)}\int_0^\infty (1 - e^{-\kappa_\eta s})I_{b\eta}(T)d\eta ,\quad \alpha (T_w,s) = \epsilon (T_w,s). \tag{20.85}
$$

Since the absorption coefficient is assumed spatially constant, the total absorptivity no longer depends on the medium's temperature. It follows that, for a gray medium with  $\kappa_{\eta} = \kappa = \mathrm{const},$

$$
\epsilon (T,s) = \alpha (T,s) = 1 - e^{-\kappa s}. \tag{20.86}
$$

We shall now assume that the emissivity and absorptivity of equation (20.85) may be approximated by a weighted sum of gray gases, or

$$
\epsilon (T,s) = \alpha (T,s)\simeq \sum_{k = 0}^{K}a_{k}(T)\left(1 - e^{-\kappa_{k}s}\right). \tag{20.87}
$$

Consistent with equations (20.84) and (20.85) we have chosen the gray- gas absorption coefficients  $\kappa_{k}$  to be constants, while the weight factors  $a_{k}$  may be functions of source temperature [wall temperature for the absorptivity and local medium temperature for emissivity, as required in equation (20.84)]. Neither  $a_{k}$  nor  $\kappa_{k}$  are allowed to depend on path length  $s$ . Depending on the material, the quality of the fit, and the accuracy desired, a  $K$  of 2 or 3 usually gives results of satisfactory accuracy [29]. Since, for an infinitely thick medium, the absorptivity approaches unity, we find

$$
\sum_{k = 0}^{K}a_{k}(T) = 1. \tag{20.88}
$$

Still, for a pure molecular gas with its "spectral windows" it would take very large path lengths indeed for the absorptivity to be close to unity. For this reason equation (20.88) starts with  $k = 0$  (with an implied  $\kappa_{0} = 0$ ), to allow for spectral windows. If the medium contains particles, such that  $\kappa_{\eta} > 0$  always, the  $k = 0$  term is simply dropped, i.e.,  $a_{0} = 0$ .

Substituting equation (20.87) into equation (20.84) and using

$$
\begin{array}{l}{1 - \alpha (T_w,s) = \sum_{k = 0}^{K}a_k(T_w)e^{-\kappa_ks},}\\ {\frac{\partial\epsilon}{\partial s'} (T,s - s') = \frac{\partial}{\partial s'}\sum_{k = 0}^{K}a_k(T)\left[1 - e^{-\kappa_k(s - s')}\right] = -\sum_{k = 0}^{K}a_k(T)\kappa_ke^{-\kappa_k(s - s')},} \end{array}
$$

leads to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I(s) = \sum_{k = 0}^{K}a_{k}(T_{w})e^{-\kappa_{k}s}I_{bw} + \int_{0}^{s}\sum_{k = 0}^{K}a_{k}[T(s^{\prime})]\kappa_{k}e^{-\kappa_{k}(s - s^{\prime})}I_{b}(s^{\prime})ds^{\prime}}\\ {= \sum_{k = 0}^{K}\left\{[a_{k}I_{b}](T_{w})e^{-\kappa_{k}s} + \int_{0}^{s}[a_{k}I_{b}](s^{\prime})e^{-\kappa_{k}(s - s^{\prime})}\kappa_{k}ds^{\prime}\right\} .} \end{array} \tag{20.89}
$$

Setting

$$
I(s) = \sum_{k = 0}^{K}I_{k}(s), \tag{20.90}
$$

and comparing equations (20.89) and (20.58) we find that  $I_{k}$  satisfies the equation of transfer

$$
\frac{dI_k}{ds} = \kappa_k([a_kI_b] - I_k), \tag{20.91}
$$

subject to the boundary condition

$$
s = 0:\qquad I_k = [a_kI_b](T_w). \tag{20.92}
$$

This expression is, of course, the equation of transfer for a gray gas with constant absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{k}$ , but with blackbody intensity  $I_{b}$  (for medium as well as surfaces) replaced by a weighted intensity  $a_{k}I_{b}$ . Thus, if the temperature field is known (or assumed), the intensity field (or simply the heat fluxes) must be determined for  $k = 0,1,\ldots ,K$ , using any standard solution method. The results are then added to give the total intensity (or radiative heat flux). Note that, as for the stepwise- gray approximation, it will always be necessary to know or assume a temperature profile: For radiative equilibrium the condition  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = 0$  applies to the total heat flux only and, in general,  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}_{k}\neq 0$ .

The curve fit of the total absorptivity of the medium, equation (20.87), should be tailored to the medium at hand, depending on composition, pressure levels, temperature levels, number of molecular gas bands, and so on. Only if the fit is optimized will one be able to achieve acceptable accuracy with a weighted sum of two or three gray gases. Unfortunately, the curve fit is a nonlinear one, and is further complicated by the fact that the  $a_{k}$  may be functions of temperature, pressure, composition, and so forth. As a result of these difficulties the curve fitting effort may become more involved than the heat transfer calculations themselves! Some weighted- gray- gas absorptivity fits for important gases have been reported in the literature for use with the zonal method (Chapter 18), e.g., by Smith and coworkers [71] for water vapor- carbon dioxide mixtures, and by Farag and Allam [72] for carbon dioxide. A "cookbook" formula for any gas, for which wide band data are available, has been given by Modest [40], and has been used to obtain the WSGG results included in Fig. 20- 3. A collection of WSGG parameters for varying mixtures of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and soot has been given by Truelove [73]. His correlation for the common case of  $p_{\mathrm{H_2O}} = 2p_{\mathrm{CO_2}}$  (e.g., resulting from complete combustion of methane) is reproduced in Table 20.2, with equation (20.87) slightly altered to

$$
\epsilon (T,s) = a(T,s) = \sum_{k = 0}^{K}\sum_{l = 1}^{L}a_{kl}(T)\left(1 - e^{-[k_{pk}(p_{\mathrm{H_2O}} + p_{\mathrm{CO_2}}) + k_{pd}\rho_p f_v]s}\right), \tag{20.93}
$$

where  $\rho_{p}$  is the density of the soot and  $f_{v}$  is its volume fraction. Another, similar set of WSGG parameters has been generated by Taylor and Foster [74].

Recently, to address global warming issues, oxy- fuel combustion systems have garnered a lot of attention, where oxygen (rather than air) is used to burn coal, producing an exhaust gas consisting primarily of  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ . The  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  can be condensed leaving a highly concentrated  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  stream, which can be sequestered. Temperature control is achieved by returning part of the  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ . This leads to much higher levels of  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ , promoting radiative heat transfer

and requiring different sets of WSGG parameters. Yin [75] and coworkers used the wide band model data of Table 11.3 to find a set of four gray gas parameters for ten different  $p_{\mathrm{H_2O}} / p_{\mathrm{CO_2}}$  ratios of relevance in oxy- fuel combustion. A similar set was generated by Johansson et al. [76] for two  $p_{\mathrm{H_2O}} / p_{\mathrm{CO_2}}$  ratios (1/8 and 1), employing the EM2C narrow band database [55].

Example 20.9. Consider an isothermal slab at temperature  $T = 1000\mathrm{K},$  and a total pressure of  $p = 1$  atm. The slab consists of a mixture of  $70\%$ $\mathrm{N}_2$ $20\%$ $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O},$  and  $10\% \mathrm{CO_2}$  (by volume), and is bordered by cold, black walls. Determine the heat loss from this slab as a function of slab thickness  $L,$  using the WSGG method with Truelove's parameters. In addition, determine the heat lost from the layer if the gas is mixed with soot  $(\rho_{p} = 2,000\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3},f_{v} = 5\times 10^{- 6})$

# Solution

If no soot is present, the summation over  $l$  in equation (20.93) can be carried out immediately, and with  $a_0 = (0.588 - 0.2401) + (- 0.165 + 0.2834) = 0.466,$  etc., and also using  $\kappa_{k} = \kappa_{g,k}(0.2 + 0.1)$  atm, we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{rlrlrl} & {a_0 = 0.466,} & {a_1 = 0.337,} & {a_2 = 0.159,} & {a_3 = 0.038;}\\ & {\kappa_0 = 0,} & {\kappa_1 = 0.267\mathrm{m}^{-1},} & {\kappa_2 = 4.65\mathrm{m}^{-1},} & {\kappa_3 = 71.7\mathrm{m}^{-1}.} \end{array}
$$

If we use the exact solution to the (spectral) equation of transfer, the answer was found in Example (14.1) for a gray medium as

$$
q = \sigma T^4\left[1 - 2E_3(\kappa L)\right] \tag{20.94}
$$

(where we have set  $T_{w} = 0$ $\epsilon_{w} = 1,$  and  $\tau_{L} = \kappa L$  ). Therefore, if we use the WSGG method, this leads to (in nondimensional form)

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{\sigma T^4} = \sum_{k = 0}^{3}a_k[1 - 2E_3(\kappa_kL)]. \tag{20.95}
$$

A plot of this result is given in Fig.  $20 - 6,$  together with line- by- line (LBL) results obtained from the HITEMP 1995 database [17]. The WSGG method is seen to give results of very respectable accuracy, except for extremely long path lengths, for which the method underpredicts the gas emissivity somewhat.

If soot is added to the gas mixture, the number of terms is doubled. With  $\rho_{p}f_{v} = 10^{- 2}\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3},$  we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & a_{01} = 0.348,\quad a_{02} = 0.118;\quad a_{11} = 0.246,\quad a_{12} = 0.091;\\ & a_{21} = 0.143,\quad a_{22} = 0.016;\quad a_{31} = 0.034,\quad a_{32} = 0.004. \end{array}
$$

Similarly, with  $\kappa_{p1}\rho_{p}f_{v} = 541\times 10^{- 2} = 5.41\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$  and  $\kappa_{p2}\rho_{p}f_{v} = 27.49\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$  , the corresponding gray- gas absorption coefficients become

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\kappa_{01} = 5.41\mathrm{m}^{-1},\kappa_{02} = 27.49\mathrm{m}^{-1};\kappa_{11} = 5.68\mathrm{m}^{-1},\kappa_{12} = 27.76\mathrm{m}^{-1};}\\ & {\kappa_{21} = 10.05\mathrm{m}^{-1},\kappa_{22} = 32.14\mathrm{m}^{-1};\kappa_{31} = 77.11\mathrm{m}^{-1},\kappa_{32} = 99.19\mathrm{m}^{-1};} \end{array}
$$

and the nondimensional heat flux is evaluated from

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{\sigma T^4} = \sum_{k = 0}^{3}\sum_{l = 1}^{2}a_{kl}[1 - 2E_3(\kappa_{kl}L)], \tag{20.96}
$$

which is also plotted in Fig. 20- 6 together with LBL results for a soot absorption coefficient that varies linearly with wavenumber, and that has  $C_0 = 5.71$  [obtained from equation (12.123), using the Chang and Charalampopoulos refractive index of  $m = 1.89 - 0.92i$  of Example 12.4]. For such soot the WSGG model overpredicts emission by about  $20\%$  for small slab thicknesses, and the error gradually diminishes with increasing  $L$ . Choosing  $C_0 = 7$ , or  $m = 1.38 - 0.69i$ , would result in almost perfect agreement. Truelove's report [73] admits to great uncertainty for the values of the  $\kappa_{pl}$ , and the values reported in Table 20.2 represent compromise values chosen by Bressloff [77]. Also, equation (20.93) requires the density of the soot, while equation (12.123) does not. There is additional uncertainty attached to the soot's density, which was here arbitrarily set to  $\rho_{p} = 2,000\mathrm{kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$  (approximating the density of pyrolytic graphite) and, finally, there are great variations possible in the index of refraction, as shown in Fig. 12- 20. Therefore, considering the substantial uncertainties surrounding soot generation and properties, the agreement may be considered good; differences can be attributed to the soot model rather than the WSGG approximation.

Example 20.10. Reconsider the isothermal medium of Example 20.9 (with and without particles). Assuming the medium is confined between two parallel, cold and black plates a distance  $L$  apart, calculate the radiative heat flux within the slab, using the weighted- sum- of- gray- gases approach together with the  $P_{1}$ - approximation.

# Solution

The  $P_{1}$ - approximation for an isothermal medium with absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{k}$  and a Planck function of  $[a_{k}I_{b}]$ , bounded by cold and black plates, is

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{dq_k}{dz} = \kappa_k(4\pi [a_kI_b] - G_k),\\ \displaystyle \frac{dG_k}{dz} = -3\kappa_kq_k, \end{array}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{z=0:}&{2q_k+G_k=0,}\\{z=L:}&{-2q_k+G_k=0.}\end{array}
$$

The answer to this simple set of equations follows immediately, as a special case of Example 16.2, as

$$
q_{k}(z) = a_{k}E_{b}\frac{2\sinh\sqrt{3}\kappa_{k}(z - L / 2)}{\sinh\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{3}\kappa_{k}L + \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{3}\cosh\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{3}\kappa_{k}L}.
$$

Since the medium is identical to the one of Example 20.9, their total absorptivities and, thus, the values for the correlation coefficients  $a_{k}$  and  $\kappa_{k}$  are identical as well. The total nondimensional heat flux follows as

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{\sigma T^4} = \frac{\sum_{k = 0}^{L}q_k}{\sigma T^4} = \sum_{k = 0}^{L}\frac{2a_k\sinh\sqrt{3}\kappa_k(z - L / 2)}{\sinh\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{3}\kappa_kL + \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{3}\cosh\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{3}\kappa_kL}.
$$

Results from the  $P_{1}$ - approximation for  $z = L$  are also included in Fig. 20- 4, together with their LBL results. The trends are the same as for the previous example, with the  $P_{1}$ - approximation always slightly overpredicting emission rates. The error is largest for large optical thicknesses, which is due to the cold boundary as was discussed in Example 16.2.

At first glance, the weighted- sum- of- gases method appears to be a rather crude, approximate tool to estimate radiative heat fluxes from extremely complicated participating media. And, when the method was first developed before the advent of powerful computers and accurate, high- resolution databases, it was just that. Still, even in its crudest form, the method has enjoyed great popularity, since it is easy to apply and since more accurate calculations were difficult, if not impossible, to obtain (in part due to a lack of accurate high- temperature spectral property data). For example, Ramamurthy and coworkers [78] applied the method together with an  $S_{4}$  discrete ordinates approach to reacting flow in radiant tubes. Mesyngier and Farouk [79] investigated turbulent free convection in a square enclosure containing mixtures with water vapor and/or carbon dioxide, Liu and coworkers [80] looked at natural gas- fired furnaces, and Baek et al. [81] studied single droplet combustion, all using the WSGG scheme together with the discrete ordinates method. Kuhlert and Renz [82] considered a pulverized coal flame, and Bressloff [77] compared the accuracy of the WSGG model with results obtained from narrow band calculations, as did Pierrot and coworkers [7] (also using several other spectral methods). Yu and colleagues [83] investigated various isothermal, one- dimensional  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} - \mathrm{CO}_2-$  soot mixtures, and Omori et al. [84] used the method together with a commercial flow solver to study an industrial furnace.

Today we know that the method can also be applied to reflecting (albeit gray) walls, to variable absorption coefficients as long as they obey the scaling approximation [see equation (11.130) in Section 11.9], and that accurate gray- gas coefficients can be obtained from high- resolution databases, mostly through the extensions to the WSGG method made by Denison and Webb [3,5,85- 87]. Noting that the WSGG method can be seen as a box model of Section 20.4 with thousands of boxes across the spectrum (but relatively few different box heights  $\kappa_{k}$ ), the weight factors  $a_{k}$  are simply the sum of the  $(E_{b\eta}\Delta \eta)_i$  for all "boxes" with height  $\kappa_{k}$ , and normalized by  $E_{b}$ ; i.e., the  $a_{k}$  are the fraction of the emissive power spectrum, where the absorption coefficient equals  $\kappa_{k}$ . This approach, which they call Spectral- Line- Based Weighted- Sum- of- Gray- Gases, or SLW, can finite- difference the spectral line structure of molecular gases to any desired accuracy. Their calculations show that extremely accurate results (compared to LBL benchmarks) can be obtained for homogeneous gas mixtures, using only three or four spectral calculations and—to a lesser extent—also in mixtures with varying temperature and concentrations. Additional SLW parameters were found by Solovjov and Webb [18], who also investigated schemes to treat overlapping gas bands in mixtures [12], including soot [88]. A very similar method, the Absorption Distribution Function (ADF) model, was developed by Rivière and coworkers [6- 8] and applied to one- dimensional mixtures of water vapor and carbon dioxide with various temperature and concentration profiles. In [8] the approach is extended to include fictitious gases, as was done for the narrow band  $k$ - distribution in equation (11.138).

# 20.7  $k$ -DISTRIBUTION MODELS

When the band models were developed in Chapter 11 we noted that results were obtained in terms of spectrally averaged transmissivities or emissivities (narrow band models), total band absorptances (wide band models), or total emissivities and absorptivities (full spectrum

or "global" models), not in terms of a smoothened absorption coefficient. For that reason band models are limited to line- of- sight calculations, i.e., they cannot be used in media with reflecting walls and/or scattering particles, or at least only with great difficulty. While  $k$ - distributions share some of the weaknesses of the band models (such as difficulty to apply the method to nonhomogeneous media), they result in a reordered, rather than smoothened, absorption coefficient and can, therefore, be applied to arbitrary enclosures (including reflecting walls and scattering), using arbitrary RTE solution methods (including the stochastic Monte Carlo method discussed in Chapter 21. However,  $k$ - distributions tend to be cumbersome to assemble and must be generated individually for every cell in the computational domain, generally from high- resolution databases, such as HITRAN 2008 [1] and HITEMP 2010 [2], with their millions (and even hundreds of millions) of spectral lines. Thus, the rapid assembly of  $k$ - distributions is of utmost importance, either through correlations or using a precalculated  $k$ - distribution database.

Like traditional band models,  $k$ - distributions come in narrow band, wide band, and full spectrum or global versions.

Narrow Band  $k$ - Distribution Calculations In traditional band models "narrow band" implies a spectral range over which the applied statistics are valid (such as the Malkmus model), limiting a narrow band to  $\Delta \eta \simeq 4$  to  $10\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  for high accuracy calculations, to an absolute maximum of perhaps  $25\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . For  $k$ - distributions "narrow band" implies a spectral range across which the Planck function  $I_{b\eta}$  can be assumed to remain constant, i.e., perhaps 25 to  $100\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  for high accuracy, and up to several  $100\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  for fair accuracy. However,  $k$ - distributions require approximately 10 spectral calculations for each  $\Delta \eta$  range, making the numerical effort roughly equivalent for both types of narrow band calculations. Most narrow band  $k$ - distribution calculations to date have employed the  $k$ - distribution database of Soufiani and Taine [55] (based on HITRAN96 plus proprietary high- temperature extrapolations). Marin and Buckius [11] applied the method to a one- dimensional slab containing water vapor or carbon dioxide (but not both) with fixed concentrations and varying temperatures (steps and parabolic profiles). Using wavenumber ranges of up to  $\Delta \eta = 1000\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  they noted that little loss of accuracy occurred for  $\Delta \eta \leq 500\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ . Dembele and coworkers used the method to determine radiation from fires with water spray curtains, using the discrete ordinates method and Mie scattering for the water droplets [89], and also to predict intensities exiting from a natural gas flame [90]. Tang and Brewster [20] also studied a one- dimensional slab containing  $\mathrm{CO}_2$ , but included anisotropic scattering. Pierrot and colleagues [7, 8] considered one- dimensional slabs containing  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{CO}_2$ , as well, comparing various spectral solution methods. Liu et al. [91] tested different quadrature schemes for narrow band  $k$ - distribution calculations, and used the method for a three- dimensional geometry, to verify an approximate formulation of the statistical narrow band model applied to scattering media [91]. The method was further optimized and applied to several two- dimensional flames [92], using the EM2C database [55] to generate  $k$ - distributions from equation (11.108). Finally, Tessé [93] applied the method for the evaluation of turbulence- radiation interactions in turbulent flames.

Wide Band  $k$ - Distribution Calculations In traditional band models "wide band" implies the spectral range covered by an entire vibration- rotation band, and it is assumed (somewhat tenuously) that the Planck function is constant across the band. The same definition is generally used for  $k$ - distributions, making the distinction between narrow band and wide band  $k$ - distributions a judgement call. A number of approximate wide band  $k$ - distributions have been generated to facilitate their use, which distinguishes them from narrow band distributions. In one approach [94- 98] experimentally determined wide band parameters were reformulated, to allow their use in arbitrary RTE solvers, as described in Section 11.10. These exponential wide band based  $k$ - distributions have been tested by their authors on various one- dimensional isothermal gas mixtures contained between parallel plates. In the other approach [99- 102]  $k$ - distributions for various vibration- rotation bands of  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  were obtained from the HITRAN92 database [103], and relatively easy- to- use approximate correlations were formulated.

Full Spectrum  $k$ - Distributions and Related Methods Narrow band and wide band  $k$ - distributions rely on the fact that the Planck function is relatively constant across a band. Modest and Zhang [104] have extended the  $k$ - distribution concept to the full spectrum by incorporating the spectrally varying blackbody intensity, and showed that the WSGG method, as applied in the SLW and ADF forms, is just a crude implementation of the Full Spectrum  $k$ - Distribution (FSK) method and, as such, can also be used in media with (gray) scattering particles. Because of the close relationship between the models, the SLW method will be described as a special case of the full spectrum  $k$ - distribution approach.

# 20.8 THE FULL SPECTRUM  $k$ -DISTRIBUTION (FSK) METHOD FOR HOMOGENEOUS MEDIA

Like the WSGG method the Full Spectrum  $k$ - Distribution (FSK) method demands that, except for the absorption coefficient, no other radiative property varies across the spectrum, and then attempts to integrate the radiative transfer equation across the entire spectrum before solving it. And, like the narrow band  $k$ - distribution of Section 11.9, this is achieved by reordering the absorption coefficient into a monotonically increasing function. However, in the full spectrum case allowance must be made for a blackbody intensity (or Planck function) varying across the spectrum. The FSK method can be developed very much like a narrow band  $k$ - distribution via a gas column transmissivity (or absorptivity), clearly showing its close relationship with the WSGG approach. This has been described in the original paper by Modest and Zhang [104]. The FSK method can also be applied directly to the RTE, resulting in a more powerful derivation, because it shows that the approach is also valid for arbitrarily scattering media and for arbitrarily reflecting surfaces, as long as the absorption coefficient remains the only spectrally varying radiative property [104, 105]. We will describe here only the latter approach.

In this section we will first consider the simple case of a homogeneous medium, i.e., a medium with uniform temperature, pressure, and mixture mole fraction throughout. Such a mixture has an absorption coefficient that, while varying across the spectrum, is spatially constant. The radiative transfer equation for such a medium is, from equation (10.21),

$$
\frac{dI_{\eta}}{ds} = \kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta} - (\kappa_{\eta} + \sigma_{s})I_{\eta} + \frac{\sigma_{s}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}},\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})d\Omega^{\prime}, \tag{20.97}
$$

where- in order to establish a global model- scattering coefficient and phase function are assumed to be independent of wavenumber (gray). Let equation (20.97) be subject to the boundary conditions at a wall

$$
I_{\eta} = I_{w\eta} = \epsilon_{w}I_{bw\eta} + (1 - \epsilon_{w})\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}< 0}I_{\eta}|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} |d\Omega , \tag{20.98}
$$

where  $I_{w\eta}$  is the spectral intensity leaving the enclosure wall, due to (diffuse gray) emission and/or (diffuse gray) reflection (and extension to more general boundary conditions is straightforward, provided the surface properties remain gray).

A full spectrum  $k$ - distribution is defined, in accordance with equation (11.98) for a narrow band, as<sup>9</sup>

$$
f(T,k) = \frac{1}{I_b}\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}(T)\delta (k - \kappa_\eta)d\eta . \tag{20.99}
$$

The  $f(T,k)$  in equation (20.99) is a Planck- function- weighted  $k$ - distribution and is a function of temperature through the blackbody intensity. A reordered RTE is obtained by multiplying

![](images/8f8d71353111257870e8e414b078ee8fd8485a1a9d0f5db615724d67070abc51.jpg)

equations (20.97) and (20.98) by the Dirac- delta function  $\delta (k - \kappa_{\eta})$ , followed by integration over the entire spectrum. This leads to

$$

$$

where

$$
I_{k} = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{\eta}\delta (k - k_{\eta})d\eta \tag{20.102}
$$

is the intensity  $I_{\eta}$  collected over all spectral locations where  $k_{\eta} = k$  (per  $dk$ ). Thus, once  $I_{k}$  has been found from equation (20.100), the total intensity can be determined from

$$
I = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{\eta}d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{k}dk. \tag{20.103}
$$

Note that two Planck- function- weighted  $k$ - distributions are required: one at the temperature of the homogeneous medium,  $f(T,k)$ , and one evaluated at the wall temperature,  $f(T_{w},k)$ , but both using the absorption coefficient evaluated at the conditions of the medium. Two typical Planck- function- weighted  $k$ - distributions are shown in Fig. 20- 7 for a medium at  $T = 1000\mathrm{K}$  and a wall temperature  $T_{w} = 500\mathrm{K}$ , for a mixture of  $10\%$ $\mathrm{CO_2}$  in nitrogen at  $1000\mathrm{K}$ , 1 bar, as evaluated from the HITEMP 1995 database [17]. Unfortunately, full spectrum  $k$ - distributions vary significantly with their method of evaluation, span across many orders of magnitude (partially suppressed in Fig. 20- 7 by plotting  $f\delta k$  instead of  $f$  itself), and may be quite ill- behaved, much like their narrow band counterparts (cf. Fig. 11- 15). Also,  $k$ - distributions at different Planck function temperatures are seen to be quite different: different Planck function temperatures emphasize different parts of the spectrum and, therefore, different spectral lines. However, as noted in Section 11.9, the sharp peaks in  $f(T,k)$  are due to maxima and minima of  $\kappa_{\eta}$ , which remain the same for all Planck function temperatures. Consequently, the ratio of any two full spectrum  $k$ - distributions evaluated at different Planck function temperatures should produce a much smoother function, in particular if the temperatures are close together. This is indeed the case and is also indicated in Fig. 20- 7 through the function  $a(T,k)$ , although some remnant noise remains, in particular for (fortunately fairly unimportant) small values of  $k$  and low temperatures, as shown here. In Fig. 20- 7 the smoothing effect is most obvious

![](images/c580b2e28c8644d3befb7ca1f21c4ffa5e1c4411ec290007e4d1747e3622d33e.jpg)  
FIGURE 20-8 Planck-function-weighted cumulative  $k$ -distributions for  $10\%$ $\mathrm{CO}_2$  in nitrogen for Planck function temperatures of  $1000\mathrm{K}$  and  $500\mathrm{K}$ .

for large values of  $k$ , reducing noise by a factor of more than 100. For  $T_w$  approaching  $T$ , the  $a$ - function approaches  $a \to 1$  in a smooth manner, and is generally well- behaved for high temperatures (for both  $T$  and  $T_w$ ). The reason for this behavior is that, for low temperatures, the Planck function is essentially negligible across some important vibration- rotation bands while, at high temperatures, all bands contribute regardless of their position in the spectrum. Based on this discussion, to facilitate integration of equation (20.103), equations (20.100) and (20.101) are divided by the  $k$ - distribution evaluated at the temperature of the medium. This leads to a reordered RTE in smoothly- varying  $g$ - space, where the cumulative  $k$ - distribution  $g$  is a nondimensional, Planck- function- weighted, reordered wavenumber. This is termed the Full Spectrum  $k$ - Distribution (FSK) method:

$$
\frac{dI_g}{ds} = k\left(I_b(T) - I_g\right) - \sigma_s\left(I_g - \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_g(\hat{s}^{\prime})\Phi (\hat{s},\hat{s}^{\prime})d\Omega^{\prime}\right), \tag{20.104}
$$

with the boundary conditions

$$
I_{g} = I_{w\eta} = \epsilon_{w}a(T_{w},T,g)I_{bw} + (1 - \epsilon_{w})\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}< 0}I_{g}\left|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}\right|d\Omega , \tag{20.105}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{c}{I_g = I_k / f(T,k) = \int_0^\infty I_\eta \delta (k - \kappa_\eta)d\eta \Big|f(T,k),}\\ {g(T,k) = \int_0^k f(T,k)dk,}\\ {a(T_w,T,g) = \frac{f(T_w,k)}{f(T,k)} = \frac{dg_w(T_w,k)}{dg(T,k)}.} \end{array} \tag{20.106}
$$

Physically,  $g$  is the Planck- function- weighted fraction of the spectrum with absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{\eta} < k$ . Thus, the total intensity is evaluated from

$$
I = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{\eta}d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{k}dk = \int_{0}^{1}I_{g}dg. \tag{20.109}
$$

In equation (20.108) numerator and denominator are both evaluated at identical values of  $k$ , which in turn is related to  $g$  through equation (20.107).

The cumulative  $k$  - distributions for the  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  - distributions of Fig. 20- 7 are shown in Fig. 20- 8, and are seen to be smooth, monotonically increasing functions of nondimensional "wavenumber"  $g$  . Both  $k$  - distributions,  $k(T,g)$  and  $k(T_{w},g_{w})$  , have the same range of  $k$  - values (the absorption coefficient of  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  at  $T = 1000\mathrm{K})$  , but different  $g$  - values, and the function  $a$  is the stretching factor  $dg_{w} / dg$  between the two distributions, evaluated at identical  $k$  - values (horizontal lines in Fig. 20- 8): Wherever the slope of  $k(T_{w},g_{w})$  is less than that of  $k(T,g)$  (for the same value of  $k$ $a(T_w,T,g) > 1$  and vice versa. While  $k(T,g)$  is a monotonically increasing function (with tiny steps wherever  $\kappa_{\eta}$  has a maximum or a minimum),  $a(T_w,T,g)$  is not. Mathematically, wherever  $\kappa_{\eta}$  has a maximum or a minimum  $f(T_w,k)$  and  $f(T,k)$  both tend toward infinity, leading to a zero- divided- by- zero situation. Taking the limits,  $a(T_w,T,g)$  should be a smooth function but, in reality, this depends on the fidelity with which the  $k$  - distributions are evaluated. It is, in general, better to evaluate the  $a(T_w,T,g)$  employing the slopes of  $g(k)$  as opposed to using the  $f$  themselves, as indicated in equation (20.108), perhaps even only after slight smoothing of the  $g(k)$

It is important to understand that the FSK method given by equations (20.104) through (20.108) is an exact method (subject to the restrictions of a homogeneous medium). In fact, the method is also exact for nonhomogeneous media, provided the absorption coefficient is spatially invariant (e.g., evaluated at a reference condition and then applied to the entire medium). Within these restrictions the FSK results are equivalent to LBL calculations, the former requiring roughly 10 spectral evaluations vs. about 1,000,000 for LBL.

# 20.9 THE SPECTRAL-LINE-BASED WEIGHTED SUM OF GRAY GASES (SLW)

It is also of interest to note what happens if equations (20.104) through (20.109) are applied to a nonscattering medium bounded by black walls, and are integrated using a crude trapezoidal scheme, i.e., the variable absorption coefficient  $k(T,g)$  is replaced by a single, constant value  $\widetilde{k}_i(T)$  for the  $i$ th finite range of  $g$  spanning across  $g_{i - 1} < g \leq g_i$ . Integrating equation (20.104), and omitting the scattering terms, then reduces it to

$$
\frac{dI_i}{ds} = \widetilde{k_i} (T)\Big(\bar{a}_i(T)I_b(T) - I_i\Big),\quad i = 1,\ldots ,N, \tag{20.110}
$$

for the  $N$  gray gases, subject to the boundary condition

$$
I_{wi} = \bar{a}_i(T_w)I_b(T_w), \tag{20.111}
$$

where

$$
I_{i} = I_{g}(\widetilde{k_{i}})(g_{i} - g_{i - 1}). \tag{20.112}
$$

The weight function  $\bar{a}_i$  in equation (20.110) is

$$
\bar{a}_i(T) = g_i - g_{i - 1}, \tag{20.113}
$$

while for the boundary condition  $\bar{a}_i$  is evaluated from equation (20.108) as

$$
\bar{a}_i(T_w) = \int_{g_{i - 1}}^{g_i}a(T_w,T,g)dg(T) = \int_{g_{w,i - 1}}^{g_{w,i}}dg_w(T_w) = g_{w,i} - g_{w,i - 1}. \tag{20.114}
$$

Thus,  $\bar{a}_i$  is the  $i$ th finite range of the cumulative  $k$ - distribution evaluated at the local Planck function temperature ( $T$  or  $T_w$ ). This is also indicated in Fig. 20- 8. The  $\bar{k}_i$  is an average value of  $k(T,g)$  over the range  $g_{i - 1} < g \leq g_i$ . This is the SLW method as developed by Denison and Webb [3,5,86], who suggest evaluating  $\bar{k}_i$  from a square- root average, i.e.,

$$
\widetilde{k_i} (T) = \sqrt{k(T,g_{i - 1})k(T,g_i)}. \tag{20.115}
$$

Inspection of equations (20.91) and (20.92) shows that the SLW scheme is simply the weighted- sum- of- gray- gases method, with absorption coefficients  $k_{i}$  and weights  $a_{i}$  evaluated from a line- by- line database. While in the development of the SLW method scattering was not considered, we may conclude that  $(a)$  the WSGG method may be applied to gray scattering media as well as to gray reflecting walls, and  $(b)$  the SLW method—or the WSGG method with its parameters based on a spectral line database—is nothing but the crudest possible implementation of the FSK method. Recently, Solovjov and coworkers [106] introduced the SLW- 1 model for quick calculations with a single gray gas, which is essentially the box model of equation (20.4), but offering several ways of determining the  $\widetilde{k_{1}} (T)$ .

# 20.10 THE FSK METHOD FOR NONHOMOGENEOUS MEDIA

It was already noted in Section 11.9 that, like conventional band models, it is not possible to develop exact  $k$ - distributions for arbitrary absorption coefficients in nonhomogeneous media. Thus, to develop a full spectrum  $k$ - distribution method for nonhomogeneous media we will, as for narrow band  $k$ - distributions, assume that the spectral absorption coefficient is correlated or even obeys the scaling approximation. Defining a vector  $\phi$  that contains the composition variables that affect the absorption coefficient, i.e., temperature  $\overline{T}$ , pressure  $\rho$ , and mole fractions of gases (or the volume fraction of small particles, if present)  $\mathbf{x}$ , the absorption coefficient may be written as

$$
\kappa_{\eta}(\eta ,\phi) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}k_{\eta}^{*}(\phi ,k_{\eta}), & \mathrm{correlated},\\ k_{\eta}(\eta)u(\phi ,\phi_{0}), & \mathrm{scaled}, \end{array} \right. \tag{20.116}
$$

where  $k_{\eta}(\eta) = \kappa_{\eta}(\eta ,\phi_{0})$  is the absorption coefficient at a reference state  $\phi_{0} = (T_{0},p_{0},\mathbf{x}_{0})$ . If the absorption coefficient is correlated then, at every wavenumber where  $\kappa_{\eta}(\eta ,\phi_{0})$  has one and the same value  $k$ ,  $\kappa_{\eta}(\eta ,\phi)$  always also has one unique value  $k^{*}(\phi ,k)$ , as illustrated in Fig. 20- 9 for a small part of a  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  band. If the ratio  $k_{\eta}^{*} / k_{\eta}$  is constant (not a function of  $k_{\eta}$ ) then the absorption coefficient is scaled, and  $u(\phi ,\phi_{0})$  is called the scaling function.

For such an absorption coefficient the general radiative transfer equation (10.21) becomes

$$
\frac{dI_{\eta}}{ds} = k_{\eta}^{\star}(\phi ,k_{\eta})I_{b\eta} - \left(k_{\eta}^{\star}(\phi ,k_{\eta}) + \sigma_{s}\right)I_{\eta} + \frac{\sigma_{s}}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\eta}(\mathfrak{s}^{\prime})\Phi (\mathfrak{s}^{\prime},\mathfrak{s}^{\prime})d\Omega^{\prime}, \tag{20.117}
$$

subject to the boundary condition (20.98).

Extension of the FSK method to nonhomogeneous media with correlated absorption coefficients will require  $k$ - distributions evaluated for different absorption coefficient states  $\phi$  as well as different Planck function temperatures  $T$ . It is, therefore, important to understand the relationships between these  $k$ - distributions, as reported by Modest [105].

# Correlated Full Spectrum  $k$ -Distributions

For a nonhomogeneous medium a generalized full spectrum  $k$ - distribution is defined as

$$
f(T,\phi ,k) = \frac{1}{I_b}\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}(T)\delta \Big(k - \kappa_\eta (\eta ,\phi)\Big)d\eta , \tag{20.118}
$$

which is a function of temperature through the Planck function, and also of  $\phi$  through the state at which the absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{\eta}$  is evaluated. Similar to narrow band  $k$ - distributions Planck- function weighted  $k$ - distributions are evaluated as

$$
f(T,\phi_0,k) = \frac{1}{I_b}\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}(T)\delta \Big(k - \kappa_\eta (\eta ,\phi_0)\Big)\frac{d\eta}{dk_\eta} d\kappa_\eta = \frac{1}{I_b(T)}\sum_iI_{b\eta i}(T)\left|\frac{d\eta}{dk_\eta}\right|_{\kappa_\eta (\eta_i,\phi_0) = k}. \tag{20.119}
$$

In this relation the summation is over all occurrences where  $\kappa_{\eta}(\eta_{i},\phi_{0}) = k,$  as illustrated in Fig. 20- 9 (the absolute value signs stem from the fact that, if  $d\eta /d\kappa_{\eta}< 0,$  then also  $dk_{\eta}< 0$ ). Similarly, one can obtain the  $k$ - distribution for the local state  $\phi$ , or

$$
f(T,\phi ,k^{*}) = \frac{1}{I_{b}(T)}\sum_{i}I_{b\eta i}(T)\left|\frac{d\eta}{dk_{\eta}}\right|_{\kappa_{\eta}(\eta_{i},\phi) = k^{*}}, \tag{20.120}
$$

which has identical  $k^{*} - \kappa_{\eta}$ - intersection wavenumbers  $\eta_{i}$ , as also indicated in Fig. 20- 9. From equation (20.116) we have

$$
\left|\frac{d\kappa_{\eta}}{d\eta}\right|_{\kappa_{\eta}(\eta_{i},\phi_{0}) = k^{*}} = \left|\frac{dk_{\eta}^{*}}{d\eta}\right|_{\kappa_{\eta}^{*} = k^{*}} = \left|\frac{dk_{\eta}^{*}}{dk_{\eta}}\right|\left|\frac{dk_{\eta}}{d\eta}\right|_{\kappa_{\eta} = k} = \left|\frac{dk_{\eta}}{d\eta}\right|_{\kappa_{\eta}(\eta_{i},\phi_{0}) = k}\frac{dk^{*}}{dk} \tag{20.121}
$$

and, therefore,

$$
f(T,\phi ,k^{*})dk^{*} = f(T,\phi_{0},k)dk. \tag{20.122}
$$

The cumulative  $k$ - distribution  $g$  is then identical for both cases, i.e.,

$$
g(T,\phi_0,k) = \int_0^k f(T,\phi_0,k)dk = \int_0^{k^*}f(T,\phi ,k^*)dk^* = g(T,\phi ,k^*). \tag{20.123}
$$

Equation (20.123) may be inverted for both  $k$  and  $k^{*}$ , with both being a function of the same cumulative  $k$ - distribution  $g$ . This is the definition of correlated  $k$ - distributions.

We will now compare correlated  $k$ - distributions evaluated for the same absorption coefficient (say, at the reference state  $\phi_{0}$ ), but for different Planck function temperatures (say, local temperature  $T$  and reference state temperature  $T_{0}$ ). Using equation (20.123) this will result in two different cumulative  $k$ - distributions  $g$  (for medium temperature  $T$ ) and  $g_{0}$  (for reference state temperature  $T_{0}$ ). Since  $k(T,\phi_{0},g)$  and  $k(T_{0},\phi_{0},g_{0})$  are both reordering the same absorption coefficient (but using different weight functions),  $k(T_{0},\phi_{0},g_{0})$  is simply stretched in  $g$ - space, as

shown in Fig. 20- 10 (the four  $k$ - distributions in Fig. 20- 10 were obtained from the two absorption coefficient distributions of Fig. 20- 9, after spreading their spectral range across the entire spectrum, for Planck function temperatures of  $300\mathrm{K}$  and  $1000\mathrm{K}$ ). The two thick lines,  $k(T_{h},T_{c},g_{0})$  and  $k(T_{c},T_{c},g)$ , are both based on the thick line in Fig. 20- 9, i.e., the absorption coefficient evaluated at  $T = T_{c} = 300\mathrm{K}$  (second argument for  $k$ ). The thick, solid line shows  $k(T_{h},T_{c},g_{0})$ , implying that the Planck function is evaluated at the reference temperature, here set to  $T_{0} = T_{h} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  (first argument for  $k$ ), resulting in the reference cumulative  $k$ - distribution  $g_{0}$ . The thick, dash- dot line is the  $k$ - distribution for the same absorption coefficient, but evaluated at  $T = T_{c} = 300\mathrm{K}$  resulting in the cumulative  $k$ - distribution  $g$ . Both  $k$ - distributions have identical  $k$ - values, but different  $y$ - distributions. The thin lines in Fig. 20- 10 show the equivalent two  $k$ - distributions, with the (artificial) absorption coefficient evaluated at  $T_{0} = T_{h} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  (thin line in Fig. 20- 9). Since the absorption coefficients in Fig. 20- 9 are truly correlated, and since equation (20.123) can be applied at any temperature, including  $T = T_{0}$ , it is clear that  $k^{*}(T_{0},\phi ,g_{0})$  is stretched in exactly the same way, or

$$
k^{*}(\phi ,k) = k^{*}(T,\phi ,g) = k^{*}(T_{0},\phi ,g_{0}). \tag{20.124}
$$

Note that equation (20.124) is exact only for a truly correlated absorption coefficient: Fig. 20- 11 shows the equivalent four  $k$ - distributions for a  $10\% \mathrm{CO}_{2} - 20\% \mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O} - 70\% \mathrm{N}_{2}$  mixture evaluated from the HITEMP 1995 database [17]: if the  $k$ - distributions  $k(T_{0} = 1000\mathrm{K},T = 300\mathrm{K},g_{0})$  (Planck function evaluated at the reference temperature of  $1000\mathrm{K}$ , absorption coefficient at  $300\mathrm{K}$ ) and  $k(T_{0} = 1000\mathrm{K},T_{0} = 1000\mathrm{K},g_{0})$  (Planck function at  $1000\mathrm{K}$ ,  $\kappa_{\eta}$  at  $1000\mathrm{K}$ ) were correlated, then, from equation (20.123), they should also be correlated for a Planck function evaluated at  $300\mathrm{K}$ . This implies that for any value of  $g$  (here shown for  $g = 0.3$ ) the two  $k$ - values at one Planck function temperature (here  $300\mathrm{K}$ ) should map to identical  $g_{0}$ - values at any other Planck function temperature (here  $T_{0} = 1000\mathrm{K}$ ). This is clearly not the case for the given carbon dioxide- water vapor mixture. On the other hand, a graph such as Fig. 20- 11 can be employed to investigate how close to correlatedness an absorption coefficient actually is.

# The Full Spectrum Correlated- $k$  (FSCK) Method

A reordered RTE is obtained by multiplying equation (20.117) and boundary condition (20.98) by the Dirac- delta function  $\delta (k - k_{\eta})$ , i.e., using the absorption coefficient at a representative reference state  $\phi_{0}$  introduced in equation (20.116). This is then followed by integration over the entire spectrum. Noting that

$$
\int_0^\infty k_\eta^* (\phi ,k_\eta)I_{b\eta}(T)\delta (k - k_\eta)d\eta = k^* (\phi ,k)\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}(T)\delta (k - k_\eta)d\eta ,
$$

FIGURE 20-11(Lack of)  $k$ -distribution equivalence for varying Planck function temperatures for real gas mixtures  $(\mathrm{CO}_2 - \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} - \mathrm{N}_2$  mixture at different temperatures using HITEMP 1995:  $T_{\mathrm{hot}} = 1000\mathrm{K}$ ,  $T_{\mathrm{col}} = 300\mathrm{K}$ , uniform  $p = 1$  bar,  $x_{\mathrm{CO}_2} = 0.1$ ,  $x_{\mathrm{HeO}} = 0.2$ ).

because  $\delta (k - k_{\eta})$  is nonzero only wherever  $k_{\eta} = k$ , this leads to

$$
\frac{dI_k}{ds} = k^* (\phi ,k)f(T,\phi_0,k)I_b - \left(k^* (\phi ,k) + \sigma_s\right)I_k + \frac{\sigma_s}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_k(\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')\Phi (\hat{\mathbf{s}},\hat{\mathbf{s}} ')d\Omega ' \tag{20.125}
$$

with boundary condition

$$
I_{k} = I_{wk} = \epsilon_{w}f(T_{w},\phi_{0},k)I_{bw} + (1 - \epsilon_{w})\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} < 0}I_{k}|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} |d\Omega , \tag{20.126}
$$

and

$$
I_{k} = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{\eta}\delta (k - k_{\eta})d\eta . \tag{20.127}
$$

Again, to facilitate integration, equations (20.125) and (20.126) are divided by a  $k$ - distribution. To allow such a division, this  $k$ - distribution must be evaluated at a constant but arbitrary Planck function reference temperature  $T_{0}$  [generally chosen to be identical to the one used for the absorption coefficient in equation (20.116)]. This leads to a reordered RTE in smoothly- varying  $g_{0}$ - space, and is called the Full Spectrum Correlated-  $k$  (FSCK) method:

$$
\frac{dI_g}{ds} = k^* (T_0,\phi ,g_0)\left[a(T,T_0,g_0)I_b(T) - I_g\right] - \sigma_s\left(I_g - \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_g(\hat{s} ')\Phi (\hat{s},\hat{s} ')d\Omega '\right), \tag{20.128}
$$

subject to the boundary condition

$$
I_{g} = I_{ws} = \epsilon_{w}a(T_{w},T_{0},g_{0})I_{bw} + (1 - \epsilon_{w})\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} < 0}I_{g}|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} |d\Omega . \tag{20.129}
$$

Here

$$
\begin{array}{c}{I_g = I_k / f(T_0,\phi_0,k) = \int_0^\infty I_\eta \delta \left(k - \kappa_\eta (\eta ,\phi_0)\right)d\eta \Big / f(T_0,\phi_0,k),}\\ {g_0(T_0,\phi_0,k) = \int_0^k f(T_0,\phi_0,k)dk,}\\ {d(T,T_0,g_0) = \frac{f(T,\phi_0,k)}{f(T_0,\phi_0,k)} = \frac{dg(T,\phi_0,k)}{dg_0(T_0,\phi_0,k)},} \end{array} \tag{20.132}
$$

and the total intensity is evaluated from

$$
I = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{\eta}d\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{k}dk = \int_{0}^{1}I_{g}dg_{0}. \tag{20.133}
$$

As for a homogeneous medium, numerator and denominator in equation (20.132) are both evaluated at identical values of  $k$ , which in turn are related to  $g_{0}$  through equation (20.131). It turns out that the weight function  $a(T,T_0,g_0)$  is actually independent of  $\phi_0$  for a truly correlated absorption coefficient [as a consequence of equation (20.122)]. In equation (20.128) the  $k^{*}(\phi ,k)$  of equation (20.125) has been replaced by  $k^{*}(T_{0},\phi ,g_{0})$ , using equation (20.124), i.e.,  $k^{*}$  is the  $k(y)$  value obtained from the  $k$ - distribution obtained for the absorption coefficient at local conditions and the Planck function at reference temperature.

# The Full Spectrum Scaled-  $k$  (FSSK) Method

As for narrow band  $k$ - distributions the problem is reduced to a single  $k$ - distribution if a scaled absorption coefficient is employed. Then the  $k^{*}$ - term in equation (20.128) is replaced by

$$
k^{*}(T,\phi ,g) = k(T,\phi_{0},g)u(\phi ,\phi_{0}) = k^{*}(T_{0},\phi ,g_{0}) = k(T_{0},\phi_{0},g_{0})u(\phi ,\phi_{0}). \tag{20.134}
$$

This then becomes the Full Spectrum Scaled-  $k$  (FSSK) method:

$$
\frac{dI_g}{ds} = k(T_0,\phi_0,g_0)u(\phi ,\phi_0)\left[a(T,T_0,g_0)I_b(T) - I_g\right] - \sigma_s\left(I_g - \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_g(\hat{s}^\prime)\Phi (\hat{s},\hat{s}^\prime)d\Omega^\prime\right), \tag{20.135}
$$

with the same boundary condition (20.129) as for the FSCK method. How to determine the scaling function for a given medium will be discussed below together with the determination of a proper reference state.

Both methods given by equations (20.128) through (20.135) are "exact" like equations (20.104) through (20.108), but are now subject to the somewhat less severe restriction of an absorption coefficient that is correlated or scaled.

# The SLW Method for Nonhomogeneous Media

The SLW method of Denison and Webb can also be applied to nonhomogeneous media, including scattering media and reflecting walls. Again, integrating equation (20.128) over the  $i$ th  $g$ - range, across which  $\widetilde{k}_i$  is assumed constant, this leads to

$$
\frac{dI_i}{ds} = \widetilde{k_i} (T_0,\phi)\Big(\bar{a}_i(T,T_0)I_b(T) - I_i\Big) - \sigma_s\left(I_i - \frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_i(\hat{s}^\prime)\Phi (\hat{s},\hat{s}^\prime)d\Omega^\prime\right),\quad i = 1,\ldots ,N, \tag{20.136}
$$

subject to the boundary condition

$$
I_{wi} = \epsilon_w\bar{a}_i(T_w,T_0)I_b(T_w) + (1 - \epsilon_w)\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} < 0}I_i|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} |d\Omega , \tag{20.137}
$$

where

$$
I_{i} = I_{g}(\widetilde{k_{i}})(g_{0,i} - g_{0,i - 1}). \tag{20.138}
$$

The weight function  $\bar{a}_i$  is evaluated from equation (20.132) as

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}{\bar{a}_i(T,\phi_0)} & = & {\int_{g_{0,i - 1}}^{g_{0,i}}a(T,T_0,g_0)dg_0(T_0,\phi_0)}\\ {} & = & {\int_{g_{i - 1}}^{g_i}dg(T,\phi_0) = g_i(T,\phi_0) - g_{i - 1}(T,\phi_0).} \end{array} \tag{20.139}
$$

Thus,  $\overline{a}_i$  is the  $i$ th finite range of the cumulative  $k$ - distribution evaluated at the local Planck function temperature. This transformation from reference state  $g_0$  to local state  $g$  is indicated in Figs. 20- 10 and 20- 11 for a single value of  $g$  by the lower thin horizontal line. The  $\overline{k}_i$  is an average value of  $k^{*}(T_{0},\phi ,g_{0})$  over the range  $g_{0,i - 1}< g_0\leq g_{0,i}$  (i.e., the value from the  $k$ - distribution evaluated from the local absorption coefficient and the Planck function evaluated at the reference temperature), and is calculated as [3, 5, 86]

$$
\widetilde{k}_i(T_0,\phi) = \sqrt{k_{i - 1}(T_0,\phi)k_i(T_0,\phi)}. \tag{20.140}
$$

Again values of  $k_{i}(T_{0},\phi)$  are indicated for a single value of  $g_{0}$  in Figs. 20- 10 and 20- 11, this time as points on the thin vertical line going through  $g_{0}$ ; the top intersection for the case of  $\phi = T_h$ , the lower for  $\phi = T_c$ . These rather complicated relationships for  $\overline{a}$  and  $k^{*}$  were correctly deduced by Denison and Webb [5, 86], well before a solid theoretical foundation describing the interrelationships between  $k$ - distributions was developed by Modest [105].

Cumulative Wavenumber Solovjov and Webb [107- 109] also introduced the concept of cumulative wavenumber, defined as

$$
w(\phi ;k,\eta) = \int_0^\eta H(k - \kappa_\eta)d\eta , \tag{20.141}
$$

where  $H(k)$  is again Heaviside's unit step function, and applied it on a narrow band basis to the SLW method. Comparison with equation (11.102) shows that this is the narrow band  $k$ - distribution approach together with the  $N$  distinct gray gases of the SLW method. While Solovjov and Webb report some promising results for nonhomogeneous examples, the method is mathematically unclear and is expensive, requiring  $N_{\mathrm{nb}}\times N$  RTE evaluations, where  $N_{\mathrm{nb}}$  is the number of narrow bands employed.

# Reference State and Scaling Function

The only errors in the FSK methods for nonhomogeneous media arise from the fact that absorption coefficients of actual gases or, even more so, gas mixtures are not truly correlated. The strength of individual lines is given by equation (11.32), and is seen to be linearly proportional to the (partial) pressure of the absorbing gas, while temperature dependence consists of three parts: the rovibrational partition function, the stimulated emission term, and the influence of the lower energy state  $E_{l}$ . Pressure dependence and rovibrational partition function are the same for all lines and are, therefore, easily separated from spectral dependence. The stimulated emission term varies only gradually with wavenumber, causing little problem. It is the sharp growth of "hot lines" (lines with large  $E_{l}$ ), which essentially do not contribute at moderate temperatures, that decorrelate the absorption coefficient and make scaling difficult under extreme conditions. Line broadening is also affected by pressure and temperature, but this dependence again is fairly similar for all lines. In a mixture of gases each species has its own partial pressure and its own temperature dependence, causing further degradation of the absorption coefficient's level of correlation.

Whether the assumption of a correlated absorption coefficient is to be used (FSCK), or whether the absorption coefficient is to be scaled (FSSK), the exact  $k$  vs.  $g$  behavior can be employed only for a single reference state  $\phi_0$ . Therefore, the choice of  $\phi_0$  is very important and should be optimized for any given problem (on the other hand, the reference Planck function temperature is only a mathematical convenience, and its choice does not affect the accuracy of calculations). Modest and Zhang [104] suggest, for a medium at constant total pressure  $p$ ,

$$
\mathbf{x}_0 = \frac{1}{V}\int_V\mathbf{x}dV, \tag{20.142}
$$

$$
\kappa_{P}(T_{0},\mathbf{x}_{0})I_{b}(T_{0}) = \frac{1}{V}\int_{V}\kappa_{P}(T,\mathbf{x})I_{b}(T)dV, \tag{20.143}
$$

i.e., volume-averaged mole fraction and a Planck- mean temperature based on average emission from the volume.

In the correlated-  $k$  method, the  $k(T,\phi_0,g)$  are then determined, followed by evaluation of  $k^{*} = k(T_{0},\phi ,g_{0})$  making the assumption of corresponding  $g$  - values (and its resulting errors). If a scaled absorption coefficient is to be used, scaling functions must be found, and Modest and Zhang [104] suggest the implicit relation

$$
\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}(T_0)\exp \left[-\kappa_\eta (\eta ,\phi)L_m\right]d\eta = \int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}(T_0)\exp \left[-\kappa_\eta (\eta ,\phi_0)u(\phi ,\phi_0)L_m\right]d\eta , \tag{20.144}
$$

i.e., forcing correct evaluation of radiation leaving from a homogeneous slab equal in width to the mean beam length,  $L_{m}$  . Using  $k$  - distributions this becomes

$$
\int_0^1\exp \left[-k^* (T_0,\phi ,g)L_m\right]dg = \int_0^1\exp \left[-k(T_0,\phi_0,g_0)u(\phi ,\phi_0)L_m\right]dg_0. \tag{20.145}
$$

Both methods are about equally efficient numerically: besides the evaluation of  $k(T,\phi_0,g)$  [needed for both methods to evaluate  $k(g_0)$  and the weight function  $a]$  , for a correlated absorption coefficient  $k$  - distributions must be evaluated for all states  $\phi$  (with a Planck function based on the reference temperature). For a scaled absorption coefficient, the same  $k$  - distributions are needed, but here for the evaluation of the scaling functions  $u$  .However, the scaled-  $k$  method holds two advantages over its correlated cousin:  $(i)$  for a poorly correlated absorption coefficient the scaling function from equation (20.145) can partially correct for this lack of correlation, and  $(ii)$  alternatively, a simplified scaling function can be chosen without the use of equation (20.145), thus reducing the number of cumbersome  $k$  - distribution evaluations.

Example 20.11. Consider a mixture of  $10\%$ $\mathrm{CO_2 - 20\%H_2O - 70\%N_2}$  (by volume) confined between two cold, black plates. The mixture is at a total pressure of 1 bar and consists of a hot, isothermal layer of fixed width  $L_{h} = 50\mathrm{cm}$  and a temperature of  $T_{h} = 1000\mathrm{K},$  and a cold, isothermal layer  $(T_{c} = 300\mathrm{K})$  of variable width  $L_{c}$  . Determine the radiative heat flux leaving from the cold layer using the FSCK and FSSK methods.

# Solution

On a spectral basis the desired heat loss can be determined immediately from equation (14.54) as

$$
q_{\eta}(\tau_{\mathrm{L}}) = 2\pi \int_{0}^{\tau_{\mathrm{L}}}I_{b\eta}(\tau)E_{2}(\tau_{\mathrm{L}} - \tau)d\tau , \tag{20.146}
$$

where we have set  $J_{1} = J_{2} = 0$  (cold, black boundaries) and  $S(\tau) = I_{b\eta}(\tau)$  (no scattering). The optical coordinate for a medium with a step in temperature is

$$
\tau = \int_{0}^{x}\kappa_{\eta}dx = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\kappa_{\eta}(T_{h})x, & x\leq L_{h},\\ \kappa_{\eta}(T_{h})L_{h} + \kappa_{\eta}(T_{c})(x - L_{h}), & x\geq L_{h}, \end{array} \right.
$$

and  $\tau_{\mathrm{L}} = \tau_{h} + \tau_{c} = \kappa_{\eta}(T_{h})L_{h} + \kappa_{\eta}(T_{c})L_{c}$  . Since  $I_{b\eta}$  is constant across each layer, equation (20.146) is easily integrated to yield

$$
\begin{array}{l}{q_{\eta}(\tau_{\mathrm{L}}) = 2\pi I_{b\eta}(T_{h})\int_{0}^{\tau_{h}}E_{2}(\tau_{\mathrm{L}} - \tau)d\tau +2\pi I_{b\eta}(T_{c})\int_{\tau_{h}}^{\tau_{L}}E_{2}(\tau_{\mathrm{L}} - \tau)d\tau}\\ {= 2\pi I_{b\eta}(T_{h})E_{3}(\tau_{\mathrm{L}} - \tau)\Big|_{0}^{\tau_{h}} + 2\pi I_{b\eta}(T_{c})E_{3}(\tau_{\mathrm{L}} - \tau)\Big|_{\tau_{h}}^{\tau_{L}}}\\ {= 2\pi I_{b\eta}(T_{h})\left[E_{3}(\tau_{c}) - E_{3}(\tau_{c} + \tau_{h})\right] + \pi I_{b\eta}(T_{c})\left[1 - 2E_{3}(\tau_{c})\right].} \end{array}
$$

If the FSK method is used to calculate the "spectral" flux  $q_{g}$ , the Planck function  $I_{b\eta}$  must be replaced by a weighted value  $aI_{b}$ , and the absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{\eta}$  by a reordered  $k$ . Thus,

$$
q_{g}(\tau_{c}) = 2a(T_{h},T_{0},g_{0})\sigma T_{h}^{4}[E_{3}(\tau_{c}) - E_{3}(\tau_{c} + \tau_{h})] + a(T_{c},T_{0},g_{0})\sigma T_{c}^{4}[1 - 2E_{3}(\tau_{c})],
$$

with

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl} & {\mathrm{for~FSCK:}} & {\tau_i = k^* (T_0,T_i,g_0)L_i,} & {i = c\mathrm{or}h,} & {\mathrm{from~equation~(20.128),}}\\ & {\mathrm{for~FSSK:}} & {\tau_i = k(T_0,T_0,g_0)u(T_i,T_0)L_i,} & {i = c\mathrm{or}h,} & {\mathrm{from~equation~(20.135).}} \end{array}
$$

Before these relations can be applied, a reference temperature must be found from equation (20.143), leading to an implicit relation for  $T_{0}$

$$
\kappa_{P}(T_{0})T_{0}^{4} = \frac{L_{h}}{L_{h} + L_{c}}\kappa_{P}(T_{h})T_{h}^{4} + \frac{L_{c}}{L_{h} + L_{c}}\kappa_{P}(T_{c})T_{c}^{4},
$$

which must be solved iteratively. From Fig. 11- 31 we find

$$
\begin{array}{r}\kappa_{P}(1000\mathrm{K}) = 0.1\mathrm{bar}\times 0.231\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{bar}^{-1} + 0.2\mathrm{bar}\times 0.051\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{bar}^{-1} = 0.033\mathrm{cm}^{-1},\\ \kappa_{P}(300\mathrm{K}) = 0.1\mathrm{bar}\times 0.259\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{bar}^{-1} + 0.2\mathrm{bar}\times 0.516\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\mathrm{bar}^{-1} = 0.129\mathrm{cm}^{-1}; \end{array}
$$

for example, for  $L_{c} = 0\mathrm{cm}$  this leads to  $T_{0} = 1000\mathrm{K},$  for  $L_{c} = L_{h} = 50\mathrm{cm}$  to  $T_{0} = 780\mathrm{K},$  etc. Five  $k$  - distributions need to be determined: three of these are needed for the weight functions  $a_{j}$  all with the absorption coefficient evaluated at  $T_{0},$  but for the three Planck function temperatures  $T_{c},T_{0},$  and  $T_{h}$  . In addition,  $k^{\prime}(T_{0},T_{h},g_{0})$  and  $k^{\prime}(T_{0},T_{c},g_{0})$  are needed for the evaluation of  $\tau_{h}$  and  $\tau_{c}$  (FSCK) or the scaling function  $u(T,T_0)$  (FSSK). For the special case of  $T_{0} = T_{h}(L_{c}\simeq 0),$  all the necessary  $k$  - distributions are shown in Fig. 20- 11. For example, for  $a(T_c,T_0)$  we evaluate the  $k$  - distributions  $k(T_{c},T_{0},g)$  and  $k(T_{0},T_{0},g_{0}),$  or rather  $g(T_{c},T_{0},k)$  and  $g_{0}(T_{0},T_{0},k)$  from equation (20.148). The weight function then follows as

$$
a(T_c,T_0,g_0) = \frac{dg(T_c,T_0,k)}{dg_0(T_0,T_0,k)}\simeq \frac{\Delta g}{\Delta g_0}.
$$

For  $T_{0} = 1000\mathrm{K},$  this is the ratio of the slopes in Fig. 20- 11 of the thin dash- dot line at  $g = 0.3$  to that of the thin solid line at  $g_{0} = 0.596$  . The equivalent value for  $k^{\prime}(T_{0},T_{c},g_{0})$  is the intersection of the thick solid line at  $g_{0} = 0.596$  . If the FSSK method is employed, scaling functions must be evaluated from equation (20.145),

$$
\int_0^1\exp \left[-k^* (T_0,T_i,g)L_m\right]dg = \int_0^1\exp \left[-k(T_0,T_0,g_0)u(T_i,T_0)L_m\right]dg_0,i = c\mathrm{or}h,
$$

where  $L_{m} = 1.76(L_{c} + L_{h})$  is the mean beam length of the layer (from Table 20.2). This implicit relation is readily solved with a Newton- Raphson technique, starting with a first guess of  $u = 1$  (the correct value for  $T_{i} = T_{0}$  ), and requiring very few iterations. After determining the two weight functions  $a_{j}$  and the two  $k$  - distributions  $k^{\prime}(T_{0},T_{i},g_{0})$  (FSCK) or scaling functions  $u(T_{i},T_{0})$  (FSSK), the "spectral" flux  $q_{g}$  can be integrated over the  $g$  - spectrum, or

$$
\Psi = \frac{q(L)}{\sigma T_b^4} = \frac{1}{\sigma T_b^4}\int_0^1 q_g(\tau_c)dg\simeq \sum_{n = 1}^{N}w_n\frac{q_g(g_n)}{\sigma T_b^4},
$$

using the same quadrature as in Example 20.10. Results are shown in Fig. 20- 12, and are compared with LBL values, using the HITEMP 1995 database [17] for all the calculations. It is observed that both FSCK and FSSK results coincide with LBL data for  $L_{c} = 0$ , since the methods become exact. For  $L_{c} > 0$  the FSCK method consistently underpredicts the heat loss, with a maximum error of about 25% at intermediate  $L_{c}$ . The reason is that the FSCK method assumes the absorption coefficient to be correlated, i.e., that large  $\kappa_{\eta}$  in the hot layer (emission) line up with large  $\kappa_{\eta}$  in the cold layer (absorption). Since this is not the case (in particular in the presence of "hot lines"), absorption in the cold layer is overpredicted. The FSCK method can partially compensate for this lack of correlation, with a maximum error of only about 10% at intermediate  $L_{c}$ .

For comparison, the case of  $T_{h} = 2000\mathrm{K}$  is also included in Fig. 20- 12 ( $T_{c}$  remains at 300 K), making hot lines much more important and, thus, further decorrelating the absorption coefficients. Maximum relative errors are seen to increase slightly to about 30% (FSCK) and 15% (FSSK).

![](images/aea463c004e46a6bbf9e550e1265c9235ffd5570b6832a3201073bfee5a7c6cc.jpg)  
FIGURE 20-12Heat loss from the cold column of a two-column  $10\%$ $\mathrm{CO_2 - 20\%}$ $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} - 70\%$ $\mathrm{N}_2$  mixture at different temperatures  $(T_{h} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  and  $2000\mathrm{K},L_{h} = 50\mathrm{cm};T_{c} = 300\mathrm{K},L_{c}$  variable; uniform  $p = 1$  bar, cold and black walls), from LBL, FSsK and FSCK models, all using the HITEMP 1995 database.

Note that the weight function  $a(T,T_0)$  is always accompanied by the emissive power  $\sigma T^4$ :  $a$  is, effectively, a scaling factor attached to the absorption coefficient for emission. In cold regions emission can be neglected, and the  $a$  does not need to be calculated (in the present example, cold region emission contributes  $< 1\%$  to  $\Psi$  for  $T_{h} = 1000\mathrm{K}$ , and  $< 0.1\%$  for  $2000\mathrm{K}$ ).

Note also that the present example constitutes an "acid test" for the FSK models: the step in temperature makes the gas extremely uncorrelated. More realistic situations, such as encountered in actual combustion systems, incur much smaller errors.

A realistic example was given in Section 16.9, where a scaled- up version of the much studied (but very small and, therefore, only weakly radiating) Sandia Flame D [110] was considered in the context of the spherical harmonics RTE solution methods. Figure 16- 13 shows temperature and mass fraction distributions as well as the resulting radiative source term for one axial location. Comparing Monte Carlo results using LBL and FSCK spectral models (see Section 21.4) shows the FSCK approach to have excellent accuracy (in fact, the error across the entire computational domain rarely exceeds  $3\%$  of maximum  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}$ ), if only water vapor and carbon dioxide are allowed to radiate. If methane is included in the calculations, the gas mixture becomes very uncorrelated and small (methane) pockets with large errors are found (up to  $40\%$ ); such errors can be avoided with higher order methods discussed later in this chapter.

# 20.11 EVALUATION OF  $k$ -DISTRIBUTIONS

The full spectrum  $k$ - distribution  $f(T,k)$  and the cumulative  $k$ - distribution  $g(T,k)$  are evaluated exactly as outlined in Section 11.9, except that  $\delta \eta /\Delta \eta$  is replaced by  $I_{b\eta}\delta \eta /I_{b}$ , or

$$
f(T,k_j)\delta k_j\simeq \sum_i\frac{I_{b\eta i}(T)}{I_b(T)}\left|\frac{\delta\eta}{\delta\kappa_\eta}\right|_i\big[H(k_j + \delta k_j - \kappa_\eta) - H(k_j - \kappa_\eta)\big]. \tag{20.147}
$$

If the simple method described in Section 11.9 is used, the  $k$ - distributions can be found simultaneously for any number of temperatures  $T_{i}$ $(i = 1,2,\dots,I)$ : The relevant (i.e., contributing) part of the total spectrum is broken up into  $N$  equal subintervals  $\delta \eta$ , the absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{\eta}$  is evaluated at the center of each interval and, if  $k_{j}\leq \kappa_{\eta}\leq k_{j + 1}$ , the value of each  $f(T_{i},k_{j})\delta k_{j}$  is incremented by  $I_{b\eta}(T_{i},\eta_{h})\delta \eta /I_{b}(T_{i})$ . At the end, the cumulative function  $g(T,k)$  is again calculated

from equation (11.105), or

$$
g(T_{i},k_{j + 1}) = \sum_{j' = 1}^{j}f(T_{i},k_{j'})\delta k_{j'} = g(k_{j}) + f(T_{i},k_{j})\delta k_{j}. \tag{20.148}
$$

fskdist is the corresponding Fortran program in Appendix F that evaluates the  $f(T_{i},k_{j})$  and  $g(T_{i},k_{j})$  for a set of temperatures  $T_{i}$  and absorption coefficients  $k_{j}$ , as well as the  $a(T_{i},k_{j})$ . Figure 20- 7 shows the full spectrum  $k$ - distributions for  $10\%$ $\mathrm{CO_2}$  in nitrogen for two temperatures. For efficient integration of equation (20.109) it is desirable to have the function  $a(T,g)$  as smooth as possible, which—in turn—depends on the accuracy with which the  $f(T,k)$  are evaluated. Different smoothing schemes have been discussed in the original paper by Modest and Zhang [104].

As indicated earlier, assembling narrow band or full spectrum  $k$ - distributions from high- resolution databases is a very time- consuming task. First, the absorption coefficient must be calculated at fine spectral resolution for all relevant temperatures, pressures, and concentrations. This was apparently first done by Rivière and coworkers [111] for various gases, using the HITRAN 1992 database together with some proprietary French high- temperature extensions. For repeated calculations absorption coefficients may be precalculated and placed into an absorption coefficient database, such as the one by Wang and Modest [112], which is based on HITEMP 1995 [17] ( $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{CO}$ ), and CDSD- 1000 [113] for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ . Wang and Modest's database includes 23 temperatures (300–2500 K), 24 pressures (0.1–30 bar), and 5 concentrations, requiring about 225 GB of storage. (In its present version the database also includes several hydrocarbon species and has been updated to HITRAN 2008 and HITEMP 2010). Next, in the case of gas mixtures, the absorption coefficients of individual species are added; then the  $k$ - distribution is found from equations (20.147) and (20.148). This should be done for closely spaced  $\delta k_{j}$ . Finally, the resulting function is inverted to determine the relevant  $k$  for desired quadrature points  $g$ . Clearly, this process of assembling  $k$ - distributions is too involved to make it part of an overall heat transfer analysis, or even a pure radiation calculation. Rather, they must be available from simple correlations or from databases.

# Full Spectrum  $k$ -Distribution Correlations

Denison and Webb [3,86,114] have calculated large numbers of  $k$ - distributions for water vapor and carbon dioxide, using the HITRAN92 database [103] together with the high- temperature extrapolation scheme of Hartmann and coworkers [115]. The resulting cumulative  $k$ - distributions were then presented in the form of relatively straightforward correlations for engineering use. The correlations were subsequently updated by Modest and coworkers using the then- new HITEMP 1995 database [116, 117], and one more time for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  using CDSD- 1000 [118], after it was recognized that HITEMP 1995 is seriously in error for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  above  $1000\mathrm{K}$ . The latest correlations (for atmospheric total pressure) have been reproduced in Table 20.3 (water vapor) and Table 20.4 (carbon dioxide). The cumulative  $k$ - distributions for a Planck function temperature  $T_{P}$ , and the absorption coefficient evaluated at gas temperature  $T_{g}$ , pressure  $p = 1$  bar, and mole fraction  $x$ , are calculated from With  $k_{0} = k$  equations (20.150) and (20.151) give the cumulative  $k$ - distribution for air broadening, i.e., for small amounts of absorbing gas in air ( $x\approx 0$ , accounting for collision broadening due to collisions with air molecules; see Section 11.4). If the mole fraction of the absorbing gas is substantial, self- broadening must be accounted for (collisions between two molecules of the absorbing species), resulting in a shift in  $g$ . For  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  this shift is negligible (since  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and air molecules have roughly the same size), and  $k_{0} = k$ . However, for water vapor the effect is quite substantial (since  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  molecules are much smaller than air molecules), and must be accounted for. Modest and Singh [117] give a correlation for  $k_{0}(T_{g},k,x)$

The values for the  $b_{lmn}$  are also included in Table 20.3. As an example, results of the correlational fit (20.150) (based on the CDSD- 1000 database), for a  $10\% \mathrm{CO_2 - N_2}$  mixture at  $1000\mathrm{K}$  are compared in Fig. 20- 13 with the one calculated from the new HITEMP 2010 (which is based on a CDSD- 1000 version), both directly or assembled from the NBKDIR database described in the following section. It is observed that the fit is generally very good for large values of  $k (> 10^{- 3}\mathrm{cm}^{- 1})$ , the range over which most of the heat transfer takes place in common applications). Extensive tests have shown that Planck- mean absorption coefficients and slab emissivities determined with this correlation are never in error by more than  $10\%$  for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $8\%$  for  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ , respectively.

For the convenience of the reader several Fortran routines are included in Appendix F for the evaluation of equations (20.150) through (20.149). fskdh2o and fskdco2 are for the correlations given by Tables 20.3 and 20.4, while fskdh2odw and fskdco2dw for the older Dennison and Webb correlations are also included in Appendix F.

# $k$  -Distribution Databases

$k$  - distributions may be databased in narrow band form, which can then be collected into full spectrum versions, or they may be stored directly in full spectrum form. Narrow band  $k$  distributions depend only on the local gas state, i.e.,  $\phi = (T,p,\mathbf{x})$  , and  assuming a fixed constant pressure - can be obtained by double interpolation in temperature and mole fraction (albeit for many narrow bands). They have the additional advantage that they lend themselves better to mixing of species (as shown later in this section). Full spectrum  $k$  - distributions, on the other hand, also depend on the Planck function temperature, i.e., a triple interpolation is required.

As already indicated in Chapter 11, Soufiani and Taine [55] have assembled a narrow band database for  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{CO}_2,$  using the HITRAN 1992 database together with some proprietary French high- temperature extensions, which includes narrow band  $k$  - distributions for atmospheric pressure and 16 temperatures (EM2C database). There are 17 narrow bands for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  (ranging in width from  $100 - 300\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  ), and 44 for  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ $(50 - 500\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  widths), each containing 7 Gauss- Lobatto quadrature points. A more voluminous high- accuracy narrow band database was generated by Wang and Modest [112], using the absorption coefficients described earlier in this section. They broke up the spectrum into 248 narrow bands  $(10 - 250\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  widths), common to all species,  $(i)$  to ensure that taking a constant Planck function across each band causes  $< 0.5\%$  error, and  $(ii)$  to allow for accurate mixing of the species. The database covers 23 temperatures (300- 2500 K) and 24 pressures (0.1- 30 bar), and each  $k$  - distributions is given for nth order nested quadrature schemes: the (variable) nth order guarantees  $0.5\%$  accuracy, but the nesting allows the use of lower orders (with fewer quadrature points). The latest version of this database, extended to five species  $(\mathrm{CO}_2,\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O},\mathrm{CO},\mathrm{CH}_4,\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_4)$  , and higher temperatures and pressures, and updated to HITEMP 2010, is contained in the NBKDIR database. Both the EM2C and NBKDIR databases are included in Appendix F.

Full spectrum  $k$  - distributions from narrow band data are assembled from narrow band data using the definition of the cumulative  $k$  - distribution,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{g(T_{P},\phi_{0},k) = \int_{0}^{k}f(T_{P},\phi_{0},k)dk = \frac{1}{I_{b}}\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}(T_{P})H\big(k - \kappa_{\eta}(\phi_{0})\big)d\eta}\\ {= \sum_{j\in [\mathrm{allNB^{\prime}s}]}\frac{I_{bj}}{I_{b}} g_{j}(\phi_{0},k),} \end{array} \tag{20.152}
$$

$$
I_{bj} = \int_{\Delta \eta_{j}}I_{b\eta}d\eta . \tag{20.153}
$$

A collection of full spectrum  $k$ - distributions is included in the spectral module of Pal et al. [119]. This database covers the same temperature and pressure ranges as the Wang and Modest narrow band database, as well as their nested quadrature scheme.

Example 20.12. Reconsider Example 20.9, i.e., the heat loss from an isothermal slab at  $T = 1000\mathrm{K}$ , but here consisting of a  $90\%$ $\mathrm{N}_2 - 10\%$ $\mathrm{CO_2}$  (by volume) binary gas mixture. Calculate the heat loss from this slab using the FSK and SLW methods, employing both the HITEMP database and the correlation of Modest and Mehta [118].

# Solution

For a homogeneous medium without scattering the FSK's radiative transfer equation, equation (20.104), reduces to

$$
\frac{dI_g}{ds} = k(I_b - I_g), \tag{20.154}
$$

subject to the cold- wall boundary condition of  $I_{g} = 0$  at both walls. Since the walls are cold no  $a$ - function is needed and only one  $k$ - distribution must be obtained, either  $(i)$  directly from the HITEMP 2010 database using the Fortran program fskdist from Appendix F,  $(ii)$  assembling it from a narrow band database, such as the EM2C database [55] or the one by Wang and Modest [112] (the latter employed here), or  $(iii)$  from the Modest and Mehta correlation using subroutine fskdco2. All three distributions are shown in Fig. 20- 13, with the  $k$ - distribution obtained from the narrow band database being indistinguishable from the exact direct calculation. The solution to the spectral equation (20.154) is, as in Example 20.9

$$
q_{g}(L) = \sigma T^{4}\left[1 - 2E_{3}(kL)\right],
$$

and the total, nondimensional heat flux becomes,

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{dT^4} = \int_0^1\left[1 - 2E_3(kL)\right]dg\simeq \sum_{n = 1}^N w_n\left[1 - 2E_3\big(k(g_n)L\big)\right],
$$

where the integral is evaluated through an  $N$ - point numerical quadrature (with quadrature points  $g_{n}$  and weights  $w_{n}$ ). Usually  $N\simeq 10$  gives accuracies better than  $1\%$  if the quadrature scheme is chosen

![](images/c061419a7dc79422c540b7c04e76fc6600efbcfcea5ca12d42c289cc0eb37354.jpg)

wisely. Since  $k$ - values generally vary over several orders of magnitude, and since the larger  $k$ - values tend to have a larger impact on the solution, quadrature points should move closer together for larger values of  $k$  and  $g$ . The Gauss- Lobatto quadrature scheme [120] has probably been the most popular for this purpose. Another scheme, the  $m$ th order Gaussian quadrature of moments [120], is somewhat more flexible, because, depending on the order  $m$ , the spacing of quadrature points can be controlled. We will here use an eight- point, third order Gaussian quadrature of moments, whose quadrature points have been obtained from a Numerical Recipes [121] routine and are included in Fig. 20- 13. Results are shown in Fig. 20- 14 and are seen to virtually coincide with line- by- line results: for a homogeneous medium the FSK methods are exact and any discrepancies are due to quadrature errors (for the LBL as well as the FSK quadratures). Using the  $k$ - distribution correlation of Modest and Mehta gives very respectable results, slightly overpredicting the LBL data for intermediate  $L$ , with a maximum error of about  $5\%$  in that range. For large  $L$  the correlation would be expected to underpredict the heat loss, since the fit underpredicts small  $k$ - values (see Fig. 20- 13); indeed, Fig. 20- 14 shows the correlation to be about  $10\%$  in error for  $L = 10 \mathrm{m}$ .

For the SLW approach four  $g$ - ranges have been chosen, namely ranges (based on the LBL  $k$ - distribution) with  $k < 10^{- 3} \mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  (and a lower limit taken as  $k$  at  $g = 0.01$ ),  $10^{- 5} \mathrm{cm}^{- 1} < k < 10^{- 3} \mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ,  $10^{- 3} \mathrm{cm}^{- 1} < k < 10^{- 1} \mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , and  $k > 10^{- 1} \mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  (and the actual maximum  $k$  as the upper limit), and the same  $g$ - values are employed for the  $k$ - distribution correlation. The  $k$ - values are then calculated from equation (20.115), resulting in almost identical values for the HITEMP and correlation distributions for large  $g$  (where the correlation is very accurate), and  $k_{\mathrm{HITEMP}} > k_{\mathrm{correlation}}$  for  $g < 0.8$  (where the correlation underpredicts actual  $k$ - values); see Fig. 20- 13. Consequently, both SLW simulations yield similar results for small  $L$  (where large  $k$  dominate), with increasing underprediction by the correlation as  $L$  increases. The SLW results oscillate slightly around the LBL data, indicating that the accuracy of the SLW method depends mostly on a wise choice of  $g$ - ranges (with different optima for different slab widths  $L$ ).

# Full Spectrum  $k$ -Distributions for Mixtures

Similar to narrow band  $k$ - distributions, variable mixtures of different absorbing gases, and perhaps the addition of nonscattering particles, such as soot, pose no additional difficulty, in principle, because the absorption coefficient of all species can simply be added up. In practice, however, because of the considerable effort involved, one would like to precalculate and database all necessary  $k$ - distributions, before embarking on detailed heat transfer calculations. Because of the infinite number of possible mixture concentrations this would quickly become a Herculean task. Therefore, it would be highly desirable to build full spectrum  $k$ - distributions

for arbitrary gas mixtures from relatively few distributions databased for individual species. Exact construction of such  $k$ - distributions is possible as long as the absorption coefficient of each species is unaffected by the other species (i.e., collisions with varying amounts of other species have no impact on line broadening), but the integral in equation (20.109) or (20.133) becomes a multiple integral (one for each species) [6, 8, 12]. Numerical effort would increase from  $N$  RTE evaluations (number of quadrature points), to  $N^M$  RTE evaluations in a mixture of  $M$  absorbing species, quickly eliminating the advantages of the FSK methods. Mixing full spectrum  $k$ - distributions is essentially identical to the narrow band mixing case described in Section 11.9, equations (11.111) through (11.126) and, therefore, the discussion here will be very brief.

Variable Mole Fraction of a Single Absorbing Gas As in equation (11.111) we consider an absorption coefficient that is linearly dependent on its partial pressure, i.e., a gas whose line broadening is unaffected by its own partial pressure, or

$$
\kappa_{x\eta}(T,p,x;\eta) = x\kappa_{\eta}(T,p;\eta). \tag{20.155}
$$

Going through the identical steps as for narrow bands, we obtain

$$
f_{x}(T_{P},T_{g},p,x;k_{x}) = \frac{1}{x} f(T_{P},T_{g},p;k_{x} / x), \tag{20.156}
$$

and

$$
g(T_{P},T_{g},p;k) = g_{x}(T_{P},T_{g},p,x;k_{x}), \tag{20.157}
$$

where the arguments, from the definition of full spectrum  $k$ - distributions, now include a Planck function temperature  $T_P$ . As before, the  $k$  vs.  $g$  behavior is independent of mole fraction, with  $k_x$  smaller than  $k(g)$  by the multiplicative factor  $x$  for any value of  $g$ . Equation (20.156) also implies that the nongray stretching function  $a$  remains unaffected if the mole fraction is changed [see equations (20.108) and (20.132)].

Single Absorbing Gas Mixed with Gray Medium Identical to its narrow band equivalent, if

$$
\kappa_{p\eta}(T,p,\kappa_{p};\eta) = \kappa_{\eta}(T,p,\eta) + \kappa_{p}, \tag{20.158}
$$

it follows that

$$
\begin{array}{c}{f_p(T_P,T_g,p,\kappa_p;k_p) = f(T_P,T_g,p;k = k_p - \kappa_p)}\\ {g(T_P,T_g,p;k) = g_p(T_P,T_g,p,\kappa_p;k_p = k + \kappa_p).} \end{array} \tag{20.160}
$$

As for narrow bands, for the same  $g$  the  $k$ - values are displaced by a constant additive factor  $\kappa_p$  and, as for the variable mole fraction case, equation (20.159) implies that the weight factor  $a$  remains unaffected.

Superposition of  $k$ - Distributions Under certain conditions it may be acceptable to neglect overlap of spectral lines from different species. For example, Bansal and coworkers [122] have shown that radiation in air plasma is dominated by few widely spaced electronic excitation lines of monatomic  $N$  and  $O$ . Thus, if we consider a mixture of  $M$  different absorbing gases, whose absorption coefficients do not overlap each other anywhere across the entire spectrum, then the  $k$ - distributions of the individual species are unaffected by the others, i.e., the spectral locations where  $k = \kappa_{mn}$  for the  $m$ th species remain unaffected by the other gases, and

$$
f_{\mathrm{mix}}(T_P,T_g,p;k) = \sum_{m = 1}^{M}f_m(T_P,T_g,p;k), \tag{20.161}
$$

where the  $f_m$  are the  $k$ - distributions of the individual species. Keeping in mind that, for nonoverlapping absorption coefficients, each species must have large parts of the spectrum with  $\kappa_{mn} \equiv 0$ ,

we integrate equation (20.161) as

$$
1 - g_{\mathrm{mix}}(T_P,T_g,p;k) = \int_k^\infty f(T_P,T_g,p;k)dk = \sum_{m = 1}^M\int_k^\infty f_m(T_P,T_g,p;k)dk = \sum_{m = 1}^M\left(1 - g_m(T_P,T_g,p;k)\right).
$$

or

$$
g_{\mathrm{mix}}(T_P,T_g,p;k) = \sum_{m = 1}^M g_m(T_P,T_g,p;k) - M + 1. \tag{20.162}
$$

Therefore, the cumulative  $k$ - distribution for a nonoverlapping mixture is constructed by simply adding up the individual components. Note that  $1 - g_{m}$  is the (Planck function weighted) part of the spectrum where  $\kappa_{mn} > 0$  and, thus, their sum can never exceed unity.

$k$ - Distributions for Random Overlap As pointed out by Taine and Soufiani [123], there is no physical reason why there should be any significant correlation between the spectral variation of absorption coefficients of different gas species. If one treats the absorption coefficients of the  $M$  species as statistically independent random variables of wavenumber, the  $k$ - distributions are said to be statistically uncorrelated. Using such an argument, Soloviyov and Webb [12] postulated that the cumulative  $k$ - distributions are multiplicative, or

$$
g_{\mathrm{mix}}(T_P,T_g,p;k) = g_1(T_P,T_g,p;k)\times g_2(T_P,T_g,p;k)\times \ldots = \prod_{m = 1}^{M}g_m(T_P,T_g,p;k). \tag{20.163}
$$

Statistically Uncorrelated Gas Mixtures Taine and Soufiani [123] argued that, if the  $M$  species in a gas mixture are statistically uncorrelated, then their transmissivities should be multiplicative, i.e.,

$$
\overline{\tau}_{\mathrm{mix}} = \prod_{m = 1}^{M}\overline{\tau}_{\eta ,m}, \tag{20.164}
$$

and this was shown to be true on a narrow band basis by comparison with LBL calculations (see [123] as well as Fig. 11- 18). Based on equation (20.164) Modest and Riazzi [124] developed the narrow band mixing scheme in Section 11.9, equations (11.121) through (11.126). The same argument can also be made at the full spectrum level. Defining a full spectrum transmissivity as

$$
\overline{\tau} (T,L) = \frac{1}{I_b}\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}(T)e^{-\kappa_\eta L}d\eta , \tag{20.165}
$$

we can manipulate this expression, using the definition of the Dirac- delta function given by equation (11.99), to obtain

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\overline{\tau} (T,L) = \frac{1}{I_b}\int_{\eta = 0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}(T)e^{-\kappa_\eta L}\int_{k = 0}^{\infty}\delta (k - \kappa_\eta)dkd\eta}\\ & {\quad \quad = \int_{k = 0}^{\infty}e^{-kL}\frac{1}{I_b}\int_{\eta = 0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}(T)\delta (k - \kappa_\eta)d\eta dk}\\ & {\quad \quad = \int_{k = 0}^{\infty}e^{-kL}f(T,k)dk = \int_{g = 0}^{1}e^{-kL}dg,} \end{array} \tag{20.166}
$$

which is identical to equation (11.122). Assuming equation (20.164) to hold, the analysis is identical to the narrow band case, leading to

$$
g_{\mathrm{mix}}(T,k_{\mathrm{mix}}) = \int_{g_1 = 0}^{1}\int_{g_2 = 0}^{1}H[k_{\mathrm{mix}} - (k_1 + k_2)]dg_2dg_1 = \int_{g_1 = 0}^{1}g_2(k_{\mathrm{mix}} - k_1)dg_1 \tag{20.167}
$$

for a mixture of  $M$  species, but now using full spectrum  $k$ - distributions.

Mixtures of Gases and Particles If the particles are assumed to be gray, equation (20.160) applies directly, i.e., the full spectrum  $k$ - distribution is found for the gas mixture as  $g(T_P,T_g,p;k)$ . The mixture's  $k$ - distribution is then determined by simply adding the particles' constant absorption coefficient  $\kappa_p$  for every value of  $g$ . If the particles' absorption coefficient is nongray, mixing must be performed at the narrow band level, assuming that  $\kappa_{p\eta} = \kappa_{p,j}$  is constant across narrow band range  $j$ . Any of the narrow band schemes described in Section 11.9 may be employed. For example, with the Modest and Riazzi [124] model, equation (11.126), for each narrow band:

$$
g_{\mathrm{mix},j}(\phi_0,k) = \int_{g_1 = 0}^{1}\dots \int_{g_M = 0}^{1}H[k_{\mathrm{mix}} - (k_1 + \dots +k_M + \kappa_{p,j})]dg_M\dots dg_1, \tag{20.169}
$$

where  $\phi_0$  is the (reference) state at which the absorption coefficients of the gas are evaluated, and  $\kappa_{p,j}$  has been added to the argument inside the Heaviside function according to equation (11.119). The full spectrum  $k$ - distribution is then determined from

$$
g(T_{P},\phi_{0},k) = \sum_{j\in \mathrm{[allNB^{\prime}s]}}\frac{I_{b}}{I_{b}} (T)g_{\mathrm{mix},j}(\phi_{0},k). \tag{20.170}
$$

Test Calculations A real gas mixture will, of course, always have some spectral overlap, and the absorption coefficient will never be quite statistically uncorrelated. Figure 20- 15 shows the case of a  $10\%$ $\mathrm{CO_2 - 20\%}$ $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} - 70\%$ $\mathrm{N}_2$  mixture, with the absorption coefficient evaluated at a reference temperature of  $T_0 = 1000\mathrm{K}$ . Full- spectrum  $k$ - distributions were evaluated for a number of Planck function temperatures by five methods: (i) the exact  $k$ - distribution for the mixture was found from the HITEMP database [2], (ii) individual  $k$ - distributions were found for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ , and a mixture distribution was found from equation (20.162) (superposition, neglecting overlap), (iii) similarly a mixture distribution was determined from equation (20.163) (random overlap), and (iv) the Modest and Riazzi full spectrum mixing of equation (20.167) was

employed; finally,  $(v)$  mixing was done on a narrow band basis, using the Modest and Riazzi scheme, equation (11.125), after which the full spectrum distribution was obtained from equation (20.152). Figure 20- 15 shows that all approximate methods predict the correct distribution very well for large values of  $k$ . For very small values of  $k$  substantial overlap between species is to be expected, and the superposition method fails. The product method, on the other hand, appears to give good accuracy for nearly all conditions. The uncorrelated transmissivity scheme of Modest and Riazzi, when applied on a full- spectrum basis, displays good accuracy similar to the multiplication scheme, but outperforms it for very small values of  $k$ . When applied at the narrow band level, the uncorrelated mixing rule is virtually exact (lines become indistinguishable). Note that the  $k(g)$  levels decrease with temperature, because of the strong effect of the rotational band of water vapor at long wavelengths, favoring low temperatures. When applied to evaluate the radiative source within a homogeneous slab [124] (for which directly calculated  $k$ - distributions return exact answers), the multiplication scheme incurred errors of  $4\%$  and  $5\%$  when mixing on narrow band and full spectrum levels, respectively, while the Modest and Riazzi mixing scheme resulted in  $0\%$  and  $1\%$  error, respectively. These findings were corroborated by Demarco et al. [125], who tested several spectral models (WSGG with parameters from Smith and coworkers [71]; statistical narrow band using the EM2C database [55]; and SLW and FSCK using the EM2C database [55]) to assemble full- spectrum  $k$ - distributions) as well as mixing models (superposition, multiplication and uncorrelated mixing), and found that the combination of FSCK with the Modest and Riazzi mixing scheme gave the most accurate results.

The methods were also tested for gas mixtures with nonscattering soot, using equation (12.123) with a volume fraction of  $f_{v} = 5\times 10^{- 6}$  and a refractive index  $m = 1.89 - 0.92i$ . Clearly, none of the first four methods should work terribly well, since strong overlap is assured, and the soot absorption coefficient is anything but random. That Fig. 20- 16, nonetheless, shows reasonable agreement is a consequence of the fact that the soot  $k$ - distribution dominates the mixture, especially at high Planck function temperatures (favoring short wavelengths with strong soot and weak gas radiation). For the same reason  $k(g)$  values now increase with temperature. None of the assumptions underlying scheme  $(v)$  are violated, and it again displays superb accuracy (with its line indistinguishable from the exact one).

# Solution

The solution proceeds identically to that of Example 20.11, except that the five  $k$  - distributions are evaluated differently.

Subroutines fskdco2 and fskdh2o are provided in Appendix F to calculate the individual  $k$  distributions for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O},$  respectively. Combined  $k$  - distributions are then obtained using program fskdistmix, choosing the proper mixing option, i.e., applying equations (20.162) (superposition), (20.163) (multiplication), or (20.167) (uncorrelated mixture). Results from the FSCK method are shown in Fig. 20- 17 and are compared with LBL results, all using the identical spectroscopic databases (CDSD1000 for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and HITEMP 1995 for  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  ) that were used for the correlations given in Tables 20.3 and 20.4. As was observed in Fig. 20- 12 for this problem the FSCK scheme is less accurate than FSSK, giving fair answers for a hot medium temperature of  $T_{h} = 1000\mathrm{K},$  but rather poor answers for  $T_{h} = 2000\mathrm{K}$  . For  $T_{h} = 1000\mathrm{K}$  the agreement between the directly calculated FSCK and those from the correlations is good for all three mixing schemes, with- - as expected- - the uncorrelated mixture scheme of equation (20.167) giving the best results. At  $T_{h} = 2000\mathrm{K}$  there is a considerable difference between directly calculated FSCK results and those from the correlations, indicating that one or both of the correlations loses accuracy (probably the  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  correlation, which- - due to neglect of  $T_{p}$  - dependence- - becomes inaccurate for the small values of  $k$  important here). For both cases the superposition method returns the least- accurate answers and should be avoided. While the uncorrelated- mixture approach always is the most accurate, the multiplication scheme returns respectable results with less effort and, given the inaccuracies of the correlations, may be sufficient.

The exiting flux for this example was also calculated using the NBKDIR database given in Appendix F, i.e., the FSCK result compiled from databased narrow band  $k$  - distributions for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  mixed at the narrow band level with the Modest and Riazzi (uncorrelated mixture) scheme. Those results are virtually indistinguishable from the directly calculated FSCK line in Fig. 20- 17, attesting to the accuracy of this mixing model.

Also shown in Fig. 20- 17 are LBL results obtained with the latest HITEMP 2010 database [2] (for both  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  ) yielding a noticeably higher heat flux at  $T_{h} = 2000\mathrm{K},$  due to the inclusion of many more high- temperature lines for water vapor. On the other hand, the LBL flux given in Fig. 20- 12 is quite a bit larger for the higher temperature, in this case due to errors in HITEMP 1995 that manifest themselves for  $T > 1000\mathrm{K}$  (incorrectly strong high- temperature lines for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ , as discussed in Chapter 11).

# 20.12 HIGHER ORDER  $k$  -DISTRIBUTION METHODS

20.12 HIGHER ORDER  $k$ - DISTRIBUTION METHODSThe FSK method is exact for homogeneous media, and also for materials with a "correlated" absorption coefficient, i.e., media where spectral minima and maxima always occur at the same wavenumbers everywhere inside the spatial domain. We noticed that this premise is violated in media with large temperature disparities, because of the rise of "hot lines" in high- temperature regions (spectral lines from elevated vibrational energy levels, which are not present in colder gas). In such cases the gas becomes "uncorrelated" and the FSK method breaks down, and likewise the SLW and ADF schemes (see Fig. 20- 12). The problem is exacerbated if the medium also contains strong concentration changes, with spectral lines of onespecies (say, a hydrocarbon fuel, such as methane) in one part of the domain, and other species (such as combustion products  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ ) elsewhere. There is no reason to believe spectral lines of two different gas species would occur at the same wavenumbers, and the gas mixture becomes uncorrelated. In fact, this uncorrelatedness between species is the basis for some of the  $k$ - distribution mixing models of the previous section.

The accuracy of the FSK methods for nonhomogeneous media (and similarly, that of the SLW and ADF methods) can be improved by breaking up the absorption coefficient of the gas into spectral scales or groups, each of which is assumed to be correlated or scaled, and solving separate RTEs for each scale or group. This was first recognized by researchers in France for the case of strong temperature inhomogeneities. They grouped spectral lines according to the values of their lower level energies into a number of "fictitious gases," first for narrow band  $k$ - distributions [10, 111] (cf. Section 11.9), and then for the ADF scheme, calling it the ADFFG (absorption distribution function fictitious gases) method [8].

While grouping spectral lines according to their lower level energies is straightforward, it does have the disadvantage that the absorption coefficients of the different scales overlap. The ADFFG treats this overlap exactly, by evaluating conditional probability density functions (i.e., the joint event that  $k_{1} = \kappa_{1\eta}$  while also  $k_{2} = \kappa_{2\eta}$ , etc.). This makes the method uneconomical beyond two or three fictitious gases, requiring  $N^{M}$  RTE evaluations, where  $M$  is the number of fictitious gases or scales and  $N$  is the number of gray gases for each scale. Zhang and Modest [14] also used this scheme to extend the validity of the FSK approach, calling it the "multiscale" MSFSK method. However, recognizing that overlap between scales (separate species or groups of species, or a single gas broken up into temperature scales) tends to be relatively minor, they opted for an approximate approach to determine overlap, arguing that a small error in overlap treatment would result in near- negligible overall error. In this way the MSFSK method requires only  $N \times M$  RTE evaluations, making it much more economical than the ADFFG approach. Zhang and Modest applied their method to gas mixtures without wall emission, using both the FSSK and FSCK schemes. They noted that—even for the worst- possible temperature steps—already a two- scale model returns near- exact answers with little difference between the scaled FSSK and the correlated FSCK. Since the FSCK is somewhat more straightforward to apply, only this scheme was pursued in further work. Wang and Modest [126] extended the MSFSK scheme to allow determination of the required  $k$ - distributions from narrow band databases, such as the one by Wang and Modest [112], and, finally, the method was further developed to allow for gray surface emission as well as for nongray particles [127, 128].

A somewhat different approach to improve the accuracy of the FSK method in the presence of strong temperature disparities is the "multigroup" or MGFSK approach [15, 16], in which spectral positions are grouped together according to their absorption coefficient's temperature and pressure dependence (i.e., the contributions from all spectral lines at one spectral location, as opposed to individual lines contributing to all wavenumbers in the multiscale/fictitious gas approach). Since there is no overlap between spectral groups, there is no need to evaluate an overlap factor with the presumption of uncorrelatedness among scales (somewhat questionable for lines from the same species). The method also requires only  $N \times M$  RTE evaluations, but

without additional approximations, and was shown to reach line- by- line accuracy with as few as  $N = 4$  spectral groups.

Recently, Pal and coworkers [129, 130] combined the advantages of the multigroup approach (breaking up the absorption coefficient of a single species according to temperature behavior, without overlap issues between groups), with those of the multiscale scheme (treating different species or groups of species as separate scales, exploiting their uncorrelatedness to accurately evaluate overlap effects). They generated a four- group narrow band database for the two most important species ( $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{CO}_2$ ), which can be used for four- group simulations or combined for two- group and single- group calculations, and it can be employed in conjunction with Wang and Modest's [112] narrow band database for other species.

For illustrative purposes we will present here only the (relatively) simple case of the MSFSK approach applied to a gas mixture without wall emission [126]. Readers interested in gas- particulate mixtures and/or wall emission should consult [127, 128], and those striving for the greatest accuracy obtainable by the hybrid multigroup- multiscale scheme are referred to [129, 130].

If one separates the contributions to  $\kappa_{\eta}$  from the  $M$  scales (such as component gases, or groups of species) and breaks up the radiative intensity  $I_{\eta}$  accordingly, i.e.,

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \sum_{m = 1}^{M}\kappa_{m\eta},\quad I_{\eta} = \sum_{m = 1}^{M}I_{m\eta}, \tag{20.171}
$$

then the RTE equation (20.97) (without particle absorption and scattering) is transformed into  $M$  component RTEs, one for each species or scale. For each scale this leads to

$$
\frac{dI_{m\eta}}{ds} = \kappa_{m\eta}(\phi)I_{b\eta} - \kappa_{\eta}(\phi)I_{m\eta} + ,\quad \mathrm{for} m = 1,\ldots ,M. \tag{20.172}
$$

Physically, the intensity  $I_{m\eta}$  for the  $m$ th scale is due to emission from the  $m$ th species but subject to absorption by all species.

If there is no particle or wall emission present in the medium, the spectral locations where  $\kappa_{\eta}$  contributes to the absorption of  $I_{m\eta}$  (i.e., absorption by all the gas scales) are only those wavenumbers for which  $\kappa_{m\eta}$  is nonzero. Therefore, the overlap region is only a subset of those wavenumbers with  $\kappa_{m\eta} \neq 0$ , across which absorption from other gases occurs as well. The MSFSK formulation takes advantage of the fact that the overlap regions for each scale are relatively small compared to the total emission/absorption spectrum of each scale.

In the absence of wall emission, equation (20.98) for scale  $m$  can be written as

$$
I_{m\eta} = I_{wm\eta} = (1 - \epsilon_w)\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}< 0}I_{m\eta}|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} |d\Omega , \tag{20.173}
$$

where  $I_{wm\eta}$  is the spectral intensity leaving the enclosure wall, due to diffuse, gray reflection.

We now apply the FSK scheme to the RTE of each scale: First equation (20.172) is multiplied by Dirac's delta function  $\delta (k_m - \kappa_{m\eta}(\phi_0))$ , followed by division with

$$
f_{m}(T_{0},\phi_{0},k_{m}) = \frac{1}{I_{b}(T_{0})}\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}(T_{0})\delta \left(k_{m} - \kappa_{m\eta}(\phi_{0})\right)d\eta , \tag{20.174}
$$

where  $\phi_0$  and  $T_0$  refer to a reference state. The resulting equation is then integrated over the entire spectrum, leading to

$$
\frac{dI_{m\eta}}{ds} = k_ma_mI_b - \lambda_mI_{m\eta},\quad \mathrm{for} m = 1,\ldots ,M, \tag{20.175}
$$

where

$$
I_{mg} = \int_{0}^{\infty}I_{m\eta}\delta \left(k_{m} - \kappa_{m\eta}(\phi_{0})\right)d\eta \bigg / f_{m}\left(T_{0},\phi_{0},k_{m}\right), \tag{20.176}
$$

subscript  $g$  pertains to the cumulative  $k$ - distribution for the  $m$ th scale,

$$
g_{m} = \int_{0}^{k_{m}}f_{m}(T_{0},\phi_{0},k)dk, \tag{20.177}
$$

$a_{m}$  is the nongray stretching factor,

$$
a_{m} = \frac{f_{m}(T,\phi_{0},k_{m})}{f_{m}(T_{0},\phi_{0},k_{m})}, \tag{20.178}
$$

and  $\lambda_{m}$  is the overlap parameter of the  $m$ th scale with all other scales, defined by

$$
\lambda_{m}I_{mg} = k_{m}I_{mg} + \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\sum_{n\neq m}\kappa_{n\eta}\right)I_{m\eta}\delta \left(k_{m} - \kappa_{m\eta}(\phi_{0})\right)d\eta \bigg / f_{m}\left(T_{0},\phi_{0},k_{m}\right) \tag{20.179}
$$

Similarly, FSK reordering is performed on boundary condition(s) with respect to  $\kappa_{m\eta}(\phi_0)$ , which results in

$$
I_{mg} = \frac{1 - \epsilon}{\pi}\int_{2\pi}I_{mg}|\hat{n},\hat{s}|d\Omega ,\quad \mathrm{for} m = 1,\ldots ,M. \tag{20.180}
$$

The last term in equation (20.175) describes the overlap of the absorption coefficient of the  $m$ th scale,  $\kappa_{m\eta}$ , with those of all other scales, which occurs over part of the spectrum. In the MSFSK method the overlap parameter  $\lambda_{m}$  is evaluated in an approximate way, such that the emitted intensity emanating from a homogeneous nonscattering layer bounded by black walls is predicted exactly. The so- determined  $\lambda_{m}$  is a function of the state variables as well as of  $k_{m}$  (or  $g_{m}$ ).

In equation (20.175) the reordering is performed in terms of the absorption coefficient of one scale  $\kappa_{m\eta}$ , and the interaction between  $\kappa_{m\eta}$  and  $\kappa_{\eta}$  during the reordering process is lumped into the overlap parameter  $\lambda_{m}$ . The reordering of equation (20.172) can also be performed in terms of  $\kappa_{\eta}$ , which, for a homogeneous layer at temperature  $T$ , leads to

$$
\frac{dI_{mg}^{*}}{ds} = \frac{k_{m}^{*}I_{b}}{f(T,\phi,k)} -k_{mg}^{*},\quad \mathrm{for} m = 1,\ldots ,M, \tag{20.181}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{c}{f(T,\phi ,k) = \frac{1}{I_b(T)}\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}(T)\delta \big(k - \kappa_\eta (\phi)\big)d\eta ,}\\ {I_{mg}^* = \int_0^\infty I_{mn}\delta \big(k - \kappa_\eta (\phi)\big)d\eta \bigg / f(T,\phi ,k),}\\ {k_m^* = \frac{1}{I_b}\int_0^\infty I_{b\eta}(T)\kappa_{mn}\delta \big(k - \kappa_\eta (\phi)\big)d\eta .} \end{array} \tag{20.183}

In equation (20.181) the interaction between  $\kappa_{m\eta}$  and  $\kappa_{\eta}$  is lumped into  $k_{m}^{*}$ . The solutions to equations (20.175) and (20.181) for a homogeneous layer at temperature  $T$  bounded by black walls (for which  $a_{m} \equiv 1$ ) can be obtained analytically, and the total exiting intensities from the gas scales at  $s = L$  are

$$
I_{m} = \int_{0}^{1}I_{mg}dg_{m} = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{k_{m}}{\lambda_{m}} I_{b}\left[1 - \exp (-\lambda_{m}s)\right]f_{m}(T,\phi ,k_{m})dk_{m},\quad \mathrm{for} m = 1,\ldots ,M, \tag{20.185}
$$

and

$$
I_{m}^{*} = \int_{0}^{1}I_{mg}^{*}dg = \int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{k_{m}^{*}}{k} I_{b}\left[1 - \exp (-ks)\right]dk,\quad \mathrm{for} m = 1,\ldots ,M, \tag{20.186}
$$

respectively. The spectrally integrated intensity,  $I_{m}$ , should be equal to  $I_{m}^{*}$ , and this requirement leads to

$$
\lambda_{m} = k,\quad \mathrm{and}\quad k_{m}f_{m}(T,k_{m})dk_{m} = k_{m}^{*}(T,k)dk, \tag{20.187}
$$

or

$$
k_{m}^{*}(T,\lambda_{m})d\lambda_{m} = k_{m}f_{m}(T,k_{m})dk_{m} = k_{m}(g_{m})dg_{m}. \tag{20.188}
$$

Equation (20.188) provides the relationship between  $\lambda_{m}$  and  $k_{m}$  that is required to solve equation (20.175). One convenient way of determining  $\lambda_{m}$  is using a partly integrated form

$$
\int_{0}^{g_{m}(k_{m})}k_{m}(g_{m})dg_{m} = \int_{0}^{k = \lambda_{m}}k_{m}^{*}(T,k)dk. \tag{20.189}
$$

The overlap parameter can be determined efficiently and accurately from a database of narrow band  $k$ - distributions of individual species (scales). One advantage of using narrow band  $k$ - distributions is that assembling mixture full spectrum  $k$ - distributions from narrow band  $k$ - distributions of individual gas species mixed at the narrow band level is more accurate than mixing entire full spectrum  $k$ - distributions of individual species. In addition, the use of narrow band  $k$ - distributions of individual species allows the inclusion of nongray absorbing particles in the participating medium, by employing equation (11.120).

For the  $m$ th scale, substituting equation (20.184), into equation (20.189) the right- hand side (RHS) may be rewritten in terms of narrow band  $k_{m}^{*}$  as

$$
\mathrm{RHS} = \int_{0}^{k = \lambda_{m}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\mathrm{nb}}}\frac{I_{bi}}{I_{b}}\frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\kappa_{m\eta}\delta (k - \kappa_{\eta})d\eta dk = \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\mathrm{nb}}}\frac{I_{bi}}{I_{b}}\int_{0}^{k = \lambda_{m}}k_{m,i}^{*}(k)dk, \tag{20.190}
$$

where  $k_{m,i}^{*}$  is the narrow band counterpart of  $k_{m}^{*}, N_{\mathrm{nb}}$  is the number of narrow bands comprising the entire spectrum, and the narrow band Planck function  $I_{bi}$  is defined by equation (20.153). In order to evaluate the integrals involving  $k_{m,i}^{*}$  in equation (20.190) in terms of narrow band  $k$ - distributions, we consider the quantity

$$
Q_{m} = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\kappa_{m\eta}\exp (-\kappa_{\eta}L)d\eta \tag{20.191}
$$

for the  $i$ th narrow band. Physically,  $Q_{m}$  is related to narrow band emission from scale  $m$ , attenuated over path  $L$  by the entire gas mixture. Using the definition of the Dirac- delta function, equation (11.99),  $Q_{m}$  can be rewritten as

$$
Q_{m} = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\kappa_{m\eta}\int_{0}^{\infty}\exp (-kL)\delta (k - \kappa_{\eta})dkd\eta = \int_{0}^{\infty}k_{m,i}^{*}\exp (-kL)dk = \mathcal{L}(k_{m,i}^{*}), \tag{20.192}
$$

i.e.,  $Q_{m}$  is the Laplace transform of  $k_{m,i}^{*}$ . It was observed in Section 20.11 that, on a narrow band basis, the spectral behavior of different species is essentially statistically uncorrelated. With this assumption,  $Q_{m}$  can also be written as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{Q_{m} = \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\kappa_{m\eta}\exp (-\kappa_{m\eta}L)\prod_{n\neq m}\exp (-\kappa_{n\eta}L)d\eta}\\ {\approx \frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\kappa_{m\eta}\exp (-\kappa_{m\eta}L)d\eta \prod_{n\neq m}\left(\frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\exp (-\kappa_{n\eta}L)d\eta\right).} \end{array} \tag{20.193}
$$

The second step follows by recognizing that the integration in the first step is an averaging operator, together with the assumption that the absorption coefficients of different scales are statistically uncorrelated. The  $k$ - distribution method can then be applied to equation (20.193) and we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & Q_{m}\approx \int_{0}^{1}k_{m,i}\exp (-k_{m,i}L)dg_{m}\prod_{n\neq m}\left(\int_{0}^{1}\exp (-k_{n,i}L)dg_{n}\right)\\ & \qquad = \int_{g_{M} = 0}^{1}\dots \int_{g_{M} = 0}^{1}k_{m,i}\exp \left(-\sum_{n = 1}^{M}k_{n,i}L\right)dg_{1}\dots dg_{M}. \end{array} \tag{20.194}
$$

Equating equations (20.192) and (20.194), we have

$$
\mathcal{L}(k_{m,i}^{*})\approx \int_{g_{1} = 0}^{1}\dots \int_{g_{M} = 0}^{1}k_{m,i}\exp \left(-\sum_{n = 1}^{M}k_{n,i}L\right)dg_{1}\dots dg_{M}, \tag{20.195}
$$

and, using the integral property of the Laplace transform,

$$
\mathcal{L}\left(\int_{0}^{k = \lambda_{m}}k_{m,i}^{*}(k)dk\right)\approx \int_{g_{1} = 0}^{1}\dots \int_{g_{M} = 0}^{1}k_{m}\frac{\exp(-\sum_{n = 1}^{M}k_{n}L)}{L} dg_{1}\dots dg_{M}. \tag{20.196}
$$

Finally, taking the inverse Laplace transform, we obtain

$$
\int_{0}^{k = \lambda_{m}}k_{m,i}^{*}(k)dk\approx \int_{g_{1} = 0}^{1}\dots \int_{g_{M} = 0}^{1}k_{m}H\left(k - \sum_{n = 1}^{M}k_{n}\right)dg_{1}\dots dg_{M}, \tag{20.197}
$$

where  $H$  is the Heaviside step function.

The left- hand side of equation (20.189) is also readily expressed in terms of narrow band  $k$ - distributions, as defined by equation (11.98), as

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathrm{LHS} = \int_{0}^{k_{m}}k_{m}\frac{1}{I_{b}}\int_{0}^{\infty}I_{b\eta}\delta (k_{m} - \kappa_{m\eta})d\eta dk_{m} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\mathrm{nb}}}I_{b i}\int_{0}^{k_{m}}k_{m}\frac{1}{\Delta\eta}\int_{\Delta \eta}\delta (k_{m} - \kappa_{m\eta})d\eta dk_{m}}\\ & {\quad = \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\mathrm{nb}}}I_{b i}\int_{0}^{g_{m,i}(k_{m})}k_{m,i}dg_{m}.} \end{array} \tag{20.198}
$$

Equating the left- and right- hand sides, we obtain a generic expression for the determination of the overlap coefficient  $\lambda_{m}$  based on narrow band  $k$ - distributions of individual gases as

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\mathrm{nb}}}\frac{I_{b}}{I_b}\int_0^{g_{m,i}(k_m)}k_{m,i}dg_m = \sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\mathrm{nb}}}\frac{I_{b}}{I_b}\int_{g_{1\mu} = 0}^{1}\dots \int_{g_{M,i} = 0}^{1}k_{m,i}H\left(\lambda_m - \sum_{n = 1}^{M}k_{n,i}\right)dg_1\dots dg_M, \tag{20.199}
$$

In this expression the  $k_{m}$  and  $\lambda_{m}$  are global values; all others  $(k_{m,i},g_{m,i}$  etc.), are for the ith narrow band. In particular, the integration in equation (20.198) is taken over the  $k$ - distribution of the ith narrow band until  $k_{m,i}$  reaches the global value  $k_{m,i} = k_{m}$ . In practice,  $\lambda_{m}(k_{m})$  is found by evaluating the left- and right- hand sides of equation (20.199) independently for many values of  $k_{m}$  and  $\lambda_{m}$  once and for all for each cell. Required values of  $\lambda_{m}(k_{m})$  for  $g$ - quadrature are then found by interpolation.

A few extreme one- dimensional examples are shown in Figs. 20- 18 and 20- 19, all considering a mixture of  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ ,  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ , and  $\mathrm{N}_2$  confined between two cold black walls [126, 130]. The mixture

Left layer:  $2\%$ $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $20\%$ $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O};$  right layer:  $20\%$ $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $2\%$ $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}.$  (a) Medium at uniform temperature (500 K or 1500 K); (b) medium with step temperature (left layer at  $1500\mathrm{K},$  right at  $500\mathrm{K}$  [126].

is at a total pressure of 1 bar and consists of two different homogeneous layers (denoted as left and right layer). The left layer has a fixed width of  $L_{L} = 50\mathrm{cm},$  and the right layer a variable width of  $L_{R}$ . The radiative heat flux leaving from the right layer is calculated. Five methods are used to calculate the exiting flux: the LBL, FSK (using both the correlated-  $k$ , FSCK, and the scaled-  $k$ , FSsK, approaches), and MSFSK (using correlated-  $k$ , both, with the overlap coefficient calculated directly from the spectral database, MSFSKdir, and calculated from the NBKDIR narrow band database, MSFSKnb) methods. In the LBL calculations, the HITEMP 1995 and CDSD- 1000 spectral databases were used for the absorption coefficients of  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{CO}_2$ , respectively. In the FSK calculations, the  $k - g$  distributions are constructed directly from the spectral databases; the reference states and the scaling functions were determined according to equations (20.142) and (20.143). Only correlated-  $k$  was considered for the present MSFSK examples. For the MSFSKdir calculations the overlap coefficients (and  $k$ - distributions) were obtained directly from HITEMP 1995 and CDSD- 1000; for the MSFSKnb calculation the overlap coefficients and  $k$ - distributions were obtained from narrow band  $k - g$  distributions read from the narrow band  $k - g$  database of Wang and Modest [112]. A 10- point Gaussian quadrature scheme was used for the spectral integrations in all FSCK, FSsK, MSFSKdir, and MSFSKnb calculations.

In Fig. 20- 18a the temperatures of both layers ( $T_{L}$  and  $T_{R}$ ) are set equal, but the species mole fractions change sharply: the left layer contains  $20\%$ $\mathrm{CO}_2$  and  $2\%$ $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ , while the right layer has  $2\%$ $\mathrm{CO}_2$  and  $20\%$ $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$ . The nondimensional heat flux exiting from the right layer is plotted in the upper half of Fig. 20- 18a as a function of the right layer width (i.e., the optical thickness of the right layer). The figure includes the results for two mixture temperatures (1500 and 500 K). The heat flux increases with increasing thickness of the right layer as emission from the right layer builds up. The MSFSK results follow the LBL calculations closely, while the FSK methods show significant departures. The relative errors of the FSCK, FSsK, MSFSKdir, and MSFSKnb calculations compared to LBL calculations are shown in the lower half of the figure. For the case of homogeneous temperature with strongly inhomogeneous gas concentration, the MSFSK

![](images/361223618762e856133629e37328fece75b16931398a0969ad99710ce0b70130.jpg)  
FIGURE 20-19 Relative errors of the FSCK, MSFSK, and MGMFSFSK (two and four groups) calculations for the two-layer slab of Fig. 20-18b with 0.1 ppm nongray soot added to right layer [130].

method gives errors less than  $1\%$  with 10 quadrature points (and, thus, RTE evaluations) for various optical thicknesses, while the FSCK and FSSK methods reach errors of  $10\%$  to  $12\%$ . As the width of the right layer increases, the FSCK and FSSK errors decrease, indicating that emission from the homogeneous right layer becomes dominant, and that limit can be predicted exactly by the FSCK and FSSK methods.

In Fig. 20- 18b, in addition to a step change in species mole fraction, a step change in mixture temperature is introduced: the temperature of the left layer is set to  $1500\mathrm{K}$ , and the right layer to  $500\mathrm{K}$ , with the same mixture as given in Fig. 20- 18a. Thus, in this example the absorption coefficients of both layers are uncorrelated due to, both, species concentration and temperature effects. Heat flux leaving the right layer is now due to emission by the left hot layer, which is attenuated by the (strongly uncorrelated) right layer. The nondimensional heat fluxes calculated by the LBL, FSCK, FSSK, MSFSKdir, and MSFSKnb methods are shown in Fig. 20- 18b against the width of the right layer. In the MSFSK calculations, the reference states are determined separately for each scale. The heat flux decreases with increasing width of the right absorption layer. For this extreme case of strong inhomogeneity in both species concentration and temperature, the FSCK and FSSK methods fail completely, while the present MSFSK method, although designed for just dealing with strong inhomogeneities in gas concentration, has a maximum error of only about  $12\%$  with 10 quadrature points for various optical thickness. The difference between MSFSKdir and MSFSKnb calculations is small, indicating that the scheme of using a database of narrow band  $k$  distributions to evaluate overlap coefficients is robust.

Finally, in Fig. 20- 19 we consider the same two- layer slab as in Fig. 20- 18b, but with 0.1 ppm soot added to the right layer [130]. Nongray soot absorption coefficients were calculated from equation (12.53), with the complex index of refraction given by Chang and Charalampopoulos [131], equation (12.116). Again, LBL, FSCK, and MSFSK results are shown, the latter using 3 scales (one each for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$ ,  $\mathrm{H_2O}$ , and soot) within the extended MSFSK model of Pal and Modest [128]. Also included are hybrid multigroup- multiscale results [130] (three scales, two or four groups each for  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $\mathrm{H_2O}$ ). It is seen that the FSCK incurs a maximum error of close to  $60\%$ , but even the three- scale MSFSK displays large errors, indicating that the method cannot always cope with severe temperature and concentration inhomogeneity in multiphase mixtures. The hybrid model, on the other hand, never has errors exceeding  $5\%$ , with the two- group model requiring  $2 \times 10(\mathrm{CO_2}) + 2 \times 10(\mathrm{H_2O}) + 10(\mathrm{soot}) = 50$  RTE evaluations.

It should be understood that these examples (with discontinuities in temperature, concen

trations, and/or soot levels) are extreme, and are never encountered in realistic systems. For the vast majority of industrial applications the MSFSK method can be expected to produce excellent results. Pal and Modest have investigated several realistic combustion situations, applying the FSCK and MSFSK approaches to an artificial methane flame [128, 132] and all higher order methods to an ethylene flame [130] first studied experimentally by Kent and Honnery [133]. In the Kent and Honnery flame radiation from ethylene  $(\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_4),\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O},\mathrm{CO}_2,\mathrm{CO},$  and nongray soot was considered, using the FSCK scheme (10 spectral RTE evaluations), the MSFSK scheme (treating  $\mathrm{C}_2\mathrm{H}_4,\mathrm{CO},$  and soot as separate scales, and combining  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  into a single scale, for a total of four scales, or  $4\times 10$  spectral RTE evaluations), and the MSMGFSK scheme (also separating  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{CO}_2$  and breaking each into two groups, for a total of  $7\times 10$  spectral RTE evaluations). The basic FSCK scheme displayed good accuracy over most of the domain, but had errors of up to  $35\%$  (in terms of maximum  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}$ ) near the inlet; the MSFSK and MSMGFSK schemes reduced the maximum error to  $6\%$  and  $3\%$ , respectively. It was also demonstrated that the methods, including the Modest and Riazzi mixing scheme, remain accurate at high pressures [132].

We close our discussion in this section by observing that narrow band  $k$ - distributions were first applied in the field of atmospheric sciences, before the development of full spectrum  $k$ - distributions in the heat transfer field; and that the full- spectrum versions have since then found their way back to the atmospheric sciences [134, 135]. The concept may be applied to any system with strong spectrally varying radiation, and has most recently also been applied to nonequilibrium radiation in hypersonic plasmas [122, 136, 137].

# Problems

20.1 A long, cylindrical furnace bounded by a cold, black wall of  $1\mathrm{m}$  radius contains pure  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  that is isothermal at  $1700\mathrm{K}$  and at a pressure of  $p$  atm. Using the mean- beam- length method, determine the nondimensional wall heat flux  $\Psi = q_w / \sigma T^4$  as a function of pressure. Plot  $\Psi$  vs.  $p$  (actual calculations for  $p = 0.001$ , 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 should suffice).

20.2 A high- pressure isothermal mixture  $(p > 40\mathrm{atm})$  of  $80\%$ $\mathbb{N}_2$  and  $20\%$  CO at  $2000\mathrm{K}$  is contained between two large, parallel, cold black plates, spaced  $1\mathrm{m}$  apart. If the radiative flux to each wall may not exceed  $100\mathrm{kW / m^2}$ , what is the maximum pressure the gas mixture may be raised to? Use the mean- beam- length method.

20.3 An isothermal mixture of  $\mathbb{N}_2$  and soot  $(m = 2.5 - 0.15i)$  at  $2000\mathrm{K}$  is contained between two large, parallel, cold black plates, spaced  $1\mathrm{m}$  apart. If the radiative flux to each wall may not exceed  $100\mathrm{kW / m^2}$ , what is the maximum volume fraction of soot,  $f_v$ , allowed? Use the mean- beam- length method.

20.4 Two parallel, infinite, black plates at constant temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$  are separated by a nongray medium of geometrical thickness  $d = 10\mathrm{cm}$  that is at radiative equilibrium. The absorption characteristics of the medium are such that they can be approximated by

$$
\kappa_{\lambda} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\overline{\kappa} = 1\mathrm{cm}^{-1} & 3\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < 7\mu \mathrm{m},\\ 0 & \mathrm{elsewhere}. \end{array} \right.
$$

Calculate the nondimensional heat flux,  $q / \sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4)$ , for a number of  $T_{2}$ $(T_{2} = 500\mathrm{K}, 750\mathrm{K}, 1000\mathrm{K}, 1500\mathrm{K}, \text{and} 2000\mathrm{K})$  and  $T_{1} = 300\mathrm{K}$  by

(a) the differential approximation, using a gray gas with Planck-mean absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{p}$ ,  
(b) the nongray differential approximation.

For the evaluation of  $\kappa_{p}$  you may use  $T_{m} = (T_{1} + T_{2}) / 2$ . Plot, compare, and discuss your results.

20.5 A cold- walled cylindrical furnace of  $1\mathrm{m}$  radius contains pure  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  that is isothermal at  $1700\mathrm{K}$  and at a pressure of  $p$  atm. Using the  $(i)$  gray and  $(ii)$  nongray differential approximation with single band strength  $\overline{\kappa}$ , determine the nondimensional wall heat flux  $\Psi = q_w / \sigma T^4$  as a function of pressure. Plot  $\Psi$  vs.  $p$  (actual calculations for  $p = 0.001$ , 0.01, 0.1, and 1.0 should suffice; for simplification, you may assume that band width is not a function of  $p$ ).

20.6 Repeat Problem 20.5, adding steam at 0.1 atm partial pressure to the medium. You may assume that only the 2.7 and  $6.3\mu \mathrm{m}$  bands are of importance.

20.7 An infinitely long cylinder of radius  $R = 10\mathrm{cm}$  is bounded by a cold black wall. Inside the cylinder there is uniform heat generation of  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} = 38,136\mathrm{W / m}^3$  . Estimate wall heat fluxes and temperature distributions using the  $P_{1}$  - approximation if

$(a)$  the medium has a band at  $\lambda = 4\mu \mathrm{m}$  of width  $\Delta \lambda = 1\mu \mathrm{m};$  across the band it has a constant absorption coefficient such that  $\overline{\kappa} R = 100,$ $(b)$  the medium is gray with an "appropriately" chosen  $\kappa_{p},$  say by evaluating  $\kappa_{p}$  at the volumeaveraged temperature  $T_{\mathrm{av}}$  , that is

$$
T_{\mathrm{av}}^4 = \frac{1}{V}\int_V T^4 dV.
$$

20.8 The new planet in an adjacent solar system recently found by Penn State (and other) researchers has been determined to have an atmosphere consisting of nitrogen with  $1\%$  by volume NO. The planet's surface has an emittance of  $\epsilon = 0.5,$  and a temperature of  $T_{s} = 900\mathrm{K}$  . The atmosphere's total pressure is known to be  $p(z) = p_s e^{- z / L}$  (surface pressure  $p_{s} = 5$  bar, characteristic length  $L = 10\mathrm{km}$  . Assuming radiative equilibrium prevails, what is the heat loss from the planet? You may assume that for NO line broadening is unaffected by temperature.

(a) To make a coarse approximation, replace the atmosphere by a constant pressure  $(p_{s})$  layer of a thickness that would contain the correct total pressure path length. Evaluate radiative properties as if the atmosphere's temperature were constant at  $T_{s}$  
(b) The problem is to be solved by the  $P_{1}$  -approximation combined with the box model. Find the appropriate absorption coefficient(s) and other necessary parameters. You may assume that the spectral width of bands for NO is unaffected by altitude (evaluate at surface conditions). Set up equation(s) and boundary condition(s). 
(c) Determine the heat loss from the planet. 
(d) What would change if an infinitely thick atmosphere with exponentially decaying pressure were considered?

20.9 A high- pressure isothermal mixture  $(p > 40\mathrm{atm})$  of  $80\%$ $\mathbb{N}_2$  and  $20\%$  CO at  $2000\mathrm{K}$  is contained between two large, parallel, cold black plates, spaced  $1\mathrm{m}$  apart. If the radiative flux to each wall may not exceed  $100\mathrm{kW / m^2}$  , what is the maximum pressure the gas mixture may be raised to? Use the box model together with  $(a)$  the  $P_{1}$  - approximation as well as  $(b)$  the exact formulation.

20.10 The coal particles of Problem 12.3 are burnt in a long cylindrical combustion chamber of  $R = 1\mathrm{m}$  radius. The combustor walls are gray and diffuse, with  $\epsilon_{w} = 0.8,$  and are at  $800\mathrm{K}$  . Since it is well stirred, combustion results in uniform heat generation throughout of  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} = 720\mathrm{kW / m}^3$

(a) Determine the maximum temperature in the combustor, using the  $P_{1}$  /differential approximation, assuming radiation is the only mode of heat transfer (use  $\kappa = 4.5\mathrm{m}^{-1}$  and  $\sigma_{s} = 0.5\mathrm{m}^{-1}$  if the results of Problem 12.3 are not available).

(b) How will the answer change if, instead, the combustion gas is responsible for the radiation with

$$
\kappa_{\lambda} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}10\mathrm{cm}^{-1}, & 4\mu \mathrm{m}< \lambda < 5\mu \mathrm{m};\\ 0, & \mathrm{elsewhere} \end{array} \right.;\quad \sigma_{s} = 0?
$$

(c) What if both are present?

20.11 Consider a sphere of very hot molecular gas of radius  $50\mathrm{cm}$  .The gas has a single vibrationrotation band at  $\eta_0 = 3000\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  , is suspended magnetically in a vacuum within a large cold container and is initially at a uniform temperature  $T_{g} = 3000\mathrm{K}$  . For this gas  $(\rho_{a}\alpha)(T) = 500\mathrm{cm}^{- 2},$ $\omega (T) =$ $100\sqrt{T / 100\mathrm{Kcm}^{- 1}}$  , and  $\beta \gg 1$  . These properties imply that the absorption coefficient may be determined from

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \kappa_{0}e^{-2|\eta -\eta_{0}| / \omega},\quad \kappa_{0} = \frac{\rho_{a}\alpha}{\omega}
$$

and the band absorptance from

$$
A(s) = \omega A^{*} = \omega [E_{1}(\kappa_{0}s) + \ln (\kappa_{0}s) + \gamma_{\epsilon}],\qquad \gamma_{\epsilon} = 0.577216.
$$

Using the stepwise- gray model together with the  $P_{1}$ - approximation and neglecting conduction and convection, specify the total heat loss per unit time from the entire sphere at time  $t = 0$ . Outline the solution procedure for times  $t > 0$ .Hint: Solve the governing equation by introducing a new dependent variable  $g(\tau) = \tau (4\pi I_b - G)$ .

20.14 Repeat Problem 20.11 for varying line overlap  $\beta$ , say  $\beta = 0.01$ , 0.1, 1, and 10. Plot heat loss at  $t = 0$  vs.  $\beta$ .Hint: Use Table 11.2 or some other correlation for the band absorptance.

20.15 An infinitely long cylinder of radius  $R = 10\mathrm{cm}$  is bounded by a wall that is isothermal at  $T_{w} = 1500\mathrm{K}$  and has a gray emittance of  $\epsilon = 0.3$ . Inside the cylinder there is uniform heat generation of  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} = 38,136\mathrm{W / m^3}$ . The cylinder is filled with a mixture of combustion gases at  $p = 1$  atm, containing  $10\%$  by volume  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $20\%$  water vapor. Assuming the gas to be well- stirred (i.e., isothermal) determine the gas temperature using the weighted- sum- of- gray- gases approach, using the data of Table 20.2. This problem will require an iteration and, thus, is most conveniently solved on a computer.

(a) Set up all necessary equations and explain the procedure. You may use the exact relations of Section 14.6 or the  $P_{1}$ -approximation. 
(b) Write a small computer code to find the gas temperature.

Note for the  $P_{1}$ - approximation: The solution to the ODE

$$
\begin{array}{r}\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\left(\frac{df}{dr}\right) - \nu^2 f = 0 \end{array}
$$

is

$$
f(r) = C_{1}I_{0}(\nu r) + C_{2}K_{0}(\nu r),
$$

where  $I_{0}$  and  $K_{0}$  are modified Bessel functions. Note also that  $K_{0}(0) \to \infty$  and  $\bar{I_0'} (x) = I_1(x)$ .

20.16 Repeat Problem 20.7 for the case that the medium is a mixture of  $30\%$  water vapor in nitrogen, using the SLW method with four gray gases, together with the correlation of Denison and Webb. To determine an appropriate reference temperature, first make a more approximate gray calculation, using a Planck mean absorption coefficient from Fig. 11- 31.

20.17 A spherical container of  $1\mathrm{m}$  diameter is filled with pure  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and is initially at  $2000\mathrm{K}$ , 1 bar. While the  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  is continuously stirred (i.e., stays isothermal), the walls of the container are cooled such that the gray, diffuse wall  $(\epsilon_{p} = 0.6)$  remains at a constant  $T_{w} = 400\mathrm{K}$ . Determine the time it takes for the gas to cool down to  $500\mathrm{K}$ , using the FSK method together with the Denison and Webb correlation. Assume a constant reference condition of  $T_{\mathrm{ref}} = 1000\mathrm{K}$ , and use the  $P_{1}$  method to solve the RTE.

20.18 Repeat Problem 20.17 adding small gray particles with an absorption coefficient of  $\kappa_{p} = 0.1\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$  and an (isotropic) scattering coefficient of  $\sigma_{p} = 1\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$ .

20.19 Repeat Problem 20.17 adding  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{N}_2$  to the mixture, so that the final mixture has  $20\% \mathrm{CO}_2$  and  $40\% \mathrm{N}_2$  (by volume).

# THE MONTE CARLO METHOD FOR PARTICIPATING MEDIA

# 21.1 INTRODUCTION

In Chapter 8 we first introduced the Monte Carlo method for the evaluation of radiative exchange between surfaces. While statistical in nature, in this method we are tracing physically meaningful photons from their point of emission to their point of absorption, or their exit from the enclosure (albeit only a tiny, but statistically relevant sample). Therefore, the method is immediately applicable to participating media: we simply need to add statistical algorithms for the emission of photons from a gas, particles, or a semitransparent medium, as well as rules for the interaction of streaming photons with the medium, i.e., volumetric absorption and scattering.

We have observed in the previous chapters that the radiative transfer equation (RTE) is a five- dimensional integro- differential equation, which is extremely difficult and expensive to solve. In fact, while the spherical harmonics and discrete ordinates methods and, to a lesser extent, the zonal method each enjoy a certain popularity and can be applied to fairly general problems, to this day no truly satisfactory RTE solution method has emerged. The problem is exacerbated by strong spectral variations of radiative properties (gases as well as particulates), so that up to one million RTE evaluations are needed to achieve acceptable accuracy. These challenges, combined with the fact that Monte Carlo methods, unlike conventional RTE solvers, are ideal candidates for parallel computing, have led to their rapidly increasing popularity during the past few years.

# 21.2 HEAT TRANSFER RELATIONS FOR PARTICIPATING MEDIA

If the enclosure is filled with an absorbing, emitting, and/or scattering medium, equations (8.14) through (8.21) for the evaluation of surface heat fluxes must be augmented by a term to account for emission from within the medium, and the definition for the generalized radiation exchange

factor must be altered to allow for absorption and/or scattering. Again assuming a refractive index of unity, from equation (10.54) the total emission per unit volume is  $4\kappa_{p}\sigma T^{4}$  and, therefore,

$$
q(\mathbf{r}) = \epsilon (\mathbf{r})\sigma T^{4}(\mathbf{r}) - \int_{A}\epsilon (\mathbf{r^{\prime}})\sigma T^{4}(\mathbf{r^{\prime}})\frac{d\mathcal{F}_{dA^{\prime}\rightarrow dA}}{dA} dA^{\prime} - \int_{V}4\kappa_{p}(\mathbf{r^{\prime\prime}})\sigma T^{4}(\mathbf{r^{\prime\prime}})\frac{d\mathcal{F}_{dV^{\prime\prime}\rightarrow dA}}{dA} dV^{\prime \prime}, \tag{21.1}
$$

where

$\begin{array}{rlr}\kappa_{P}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime \prime}) & = & \mathrm{local~Planck - mean~absorption~coefficient~of~the~medium~at~}\mathbf{r}^{\prime \prime},\\ d\mathcal{F}_{dV^{\prime \prime}\rightarrow dA} & = & \mathrm{generalized~radiation~exchange~factor~between~volume~elements~}dV^{\prime \prime}\\ & & \mathrm{and~surface~element~}dA. \end{array}$

Equation (8.15) still applies to all exchange factors, including  $d\mathcal{F}_{dV^{\prime \prime}\rightarrow dA}$ , with the added stipulation that energy bundles may be attenuated by absorption and/or redirected by scattering.

A similar equation is needed to describe the net amount of radiative energy deposited (or withdrawn) per unit volume of the medium, i.e., the divergence of the radiative heat flux. From equations (10.59) and (11.182), it follows that

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = 4\kappa_{P}\sigma T^{4} - \int_{0}^{\infty}\kappa_{\lambda}G_{\lambda}d\lambda , \tag{21.2}
$$

where  $G_{\lambda}$  is the spectral incident radiation. The first term in equation (21.2) describes emission from within the volume, and the second term gives the absorbed fraction per unit volume of all radiation incident on the element. For Monte Carlo calculations this term may be replaced by an expression similar to the one in equation (21.1), i.e.,

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q} = 4\kappa_{P}\sigma T^{4} - \int_{A}\epsilon (\mathbf{r}^{\prime})\sigma T^{4}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})\frac{d\mathcal{F}_{dA^{\prime}\rightarrow dV}}{dV} dA^{\prime} - \int_{V}4\kappa_{P}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime \prime})\sigma T^{4}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime \prime})\frac{d\mathcal{F}_{dV^{\prime\prime}\rightarrow dV}}{dV} dV^{\prime \prime}. \tag{21.3}
$$

For numerical calculations it is again necessary to break up the enclosure into a number  $J$  finite subsurfaces and  $K$  finite subvolumes, transforming equations (21.1) and (21.3) to

$$
Q_{i} = \epsilon_{i}\sigma T_{i}^{4}A_{i} - \sum_{j = 1}^{J}\epsilon_{j}\sigma T_{j}^{4}A_{j}\mathcal{F}_{j\rightarrow i} - q_{\mathrm{ext}}A_{s}\mathcal{F}_{s\rightarrow i} - \sum_{k = 1}^{K}4\kappa_{P k}\sigma T_{k}^{4}V_{k}\mathcal{F}_{k\rightarrow i},\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,J, \tag{21.4}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{r l} & {\int_{V_{l}}\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}d V = 4\kappa_{P l}\sigma T_{l}^{4}V_{l} - \sum_{j = 1}^{J}\epsilon_{j}\sigma T_{j}^{4}A_{j}\mathcal{F}_{j\rightarrow l} - q_{\mathrm{ext}}A_{s}\mathcal{F}_{s\rightarrow l}}\\ & {\qquad -\sum_{k = 1}^{K}4\kappa_{P k}\sigma T_{k}^{4}V_{k}\mathcal{F}_{k\rightarrow l},\qquad l = 1,2,\ldots ,K,} \end{array} \tag{21.5}
$$

where the  $T_{k}$  are suitably defined average temperatures within the medium

$$
\kappa_{P k}\sigma T_{k}^{4} = \frac{1}{V_{k}}\int_{V_{k}}\kappa_{P}\sigma T^{4}d V. \tag{21.6}
$$

Using this formulation, all generalized exchange factors may then be evaluated through equation (8.21).

# 21.3 RANDOM NUMBER RELATIONS FOR PARTICIPATING MEDIA

Besides the random number relations established in the last section we need to find additional expressions for emission from within the volume, for absorption by the medium, and for scattering.

# Points of Emission within Medium

The total emission from a subvolume  $V_{k}$  is given by

$$
E_{k} = \int_{V_{k}}4\kappa_{P}\sigma T^{4}dV. \tag{21.7}
$$

Using Cartesian coordinates with  $dV = dxdydz$ , equation (21.7) may be rewritten as

$$
E_{k} = \int_{0}^{x}\left(\int_{0}^{Y}\int_{0}^{Z}4\kappa_{P}\sigma T^{4}dzdy\right)dx = \int_{0}^{X}E_{k}^{\prime}(x)dx. \tag{21.8}
$$

Then, following the development of equations (8.22) through (8.27), points of emission may be related to random numbers through

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_{x} = \frac{1}{E_{k}}\int_{0}^{x}E_{k}^{\prime}dx = \int_{0}^{x}\int_{0}^{Y}\int_{0}^{Z}\kappa_{P}\sigma T^{4}dzdydx\bigg / \int_{0}^{X}\int_{0}^{Y}\int_{0}^{Z}\kappa_{P}\sigma T^{4}dzdydx,}\\ {R_{y} = \int_{0}^{y}\int_{0}^{Z}\kappa_{P}\sigma T^{4}dzdy\bigg / \int_{0}^{Y}\int_{0}^{Z}\kappa_{P}\sigma T^{4}dzdy,}\\ {R_{z} = \int_{0}^{z}\kappa_{P}\sigma T^{4}dz\bigg / \int_{0}^{Z}\kappa_{P}\sigma T^{4}dz,} \end{array} \tag{21.9b}
$$

or

$$
x = x(R_{x}),\quad y = y(R_{y},x),\quad z = z(R_{z},x,y). \tag{21.10}
$$

Again, choices for  $x, y,$  and  $z$  become independent of one another if the emission term is separable, e.g., for an isothermal medium with uniform absorption coefficient.

# Wavelengths for Emission from within Medium

As for surface emission, the choice of emission wavelength (or wavenumber), in general, depends on emission location  $(x, y, z)$ , unless the volume is isothermal with constant absorption coefficient. From equation (10.54) and the definition of the Planck- mean absorption coefficient it follows immediately that

$$
R_{\lambda} = \frac{\pi}{\kappa_{P}\sigma T^{4}}\int_{0}^{\lambda}\kappa_{\lambda}I_{b\lambda}d\lambda , \tag{21.11}
$$

and, after inversion,

$$
\lambda = \lambda (R_{\lambda},x,y,z). \tag{21.12}
$$

# Directions for Emission from within Medium

Under local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions emission within a participating medium is isotropic, i.e., all possible directions are equally likely for the emission of a photon. All possible directions from a point within the medium are contained within the solid angle of  $4\pi = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}\sin \theta d\theta d\psi$ , where polar angle  $\theta$  and azimuthal angle  $\psi$  are measured from arbitrary reference axes. Thus, since the integrand is separable,

$$
R_{\psi} = \frac{\psi}{2\pi},\mathrm{or}\psi = 2\pi R_{\psi}, \tag{21.13a}
$$

$$
R_{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{\theta}\sin \theta d\theta = \frac{1}{2} (1 - \cos \theta), \tag{21.13b}
$$

or

$$
\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(1 - 2R_{\theta}\right). \tag{21.13c}
$$

If the polar angle is measured from the  $z$ - axis and  $\psi$  from the  $x$ - axis, then the unit direction vector for emission may be expressed as

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \sin \theta (\cos \psi \hat{\mathbf{1}} +\sin \psi \hat{\mathbf{1}}) + \cos \theta \hat{\mathbf{k}}. \tag{21.14}
$$

# Absorption within Medium

When radiative energy travels through a participating medium, the energy is attenuated by absorption and scattered. Equation (10.5) gives the absorptivity for a photon path of length  $l_{\kappa}$  as

$$
\alpha_{\lambda} = 1 - \exp \left(-\int_{0}^{l_{\kappa}}\kappa_{\lambda}ds\right). \tag{21.15}
$$

Therefore, the fraction of energy penetrating through a layer of thickness  $l_{\kappa}$  is

$$
R_{\kappa} = \exp \left(-\int_{0}^{l_{\kappa}}\kappa_{\lambda}ds\right). \tag{21.16}
$$

Note that  $l_{\kappa}$  does not have to be a straight path, i.e., the number of photons absorbed from a photon bundle depends only on the number of absorbing molecules encountered along its path. This implies that, if the total radiative energy is divided into bundles of equal energy content, the fraction  $R_{\kappa}$  will be transmitted over a distance  $l_{\kappa}$  or farther, either along a straight path or a zigzagging one (i.e., after being scattered and/or reflected one or more times). Thus, we may relate the distance that any one bundle travels before absorption to a random number by inverting equation (21.16).

This inversion is readily obtained if the absorption coefficient does not vary throughout the medium ( $\kappa_{\lambda} = \text{const}$ ). Under these conditions

$$
l_{\kappa} = \frac{1}{\kappa_{\lambda}}\ln \frac{1}{R_{\kappa}}, \tag{21.17}
$$

and the bundle is allowed to travel a total distance  $l_{\kappa}$  through the medium before being absorbed (unless it is absorbed by a surface before traveling this far).

If the absorption coefficient is not uniform (because of temperature dependence or because of a nonisotropic medium), inversion of equation (21.16) is considerably more difficult. Usually, the optical path is evaluated by breaking the volume up into  $K$  subvolumes with constant absorption coefficient. Then

$$
\int_0^s\kappa_\lambda ds\simeq \sum_k\kappa_\lambda_k s_k, \tag{21.18}
$$

where the summation is over those subvolumes  $(k)$  through which the bundle has traveled, and  $s_{k}$  is the geometric distance the bundle travels through these elements. As long as

$$
\int_0^s\kappa_\lambda ds< \int_0^{l_\kappa}\kappa_\lambda ds = \ln \frac{1}{R_\kappa}, \tag{21.19}
$$

the bundle is not absorbed and is allowed to travel on.

# Scattering within Medium

Attenuation by scattering obeys the same relationships as for absorption, with the absorption coefficient replaced by the scattering coefficient. Thus,

$$
l_{\sigma} = \frac{1}{\sigma_{s\lambda}}\ln \frac{1}{R_{\sigma}} \tag{21.20}
$$

is the distance a bundle travels in a medium with uniform scattering coefficient before being scattered, or

$$
\int_0^s\sigma_{s\lambda}ds< \int_0^{l_\sigma}\sigma_{s\lambda}ds = \ln \frac{1}{R_\sigma} \tag{21.21}
$$

for a medium with variable scattering coefficient.

Alternatively, the combined event of absorption and scattering can be modeled by determining an extinction distance,

$$
l_{\beta} = \frac{1}{\beta_{\lambda}}\ln \frac{1}{R_{\beta}}. \tag{21.22}
$$

When the location  $l_{\beta}$  is reached, a second random number  $R_{\omega}$  is required to decide whether the bundle is absorbed  $(R_{\omega} > \omega)$  or scattered  $(R_{\omega}< \omega)$ , with  $\omega$  being the single scattering albedo.

Once a photon bundle is scattered, it will travel on into a new direction. The probability that the scattered bundle will travel within a cone of solid angle  $d\Omega^{\prime}$  around the direction  $\S^{\prime}$ , after originally traveling in the direction  $\S$ , is

$$
P(\pmb {\S}')d\Omega ' = \Phi (\pmb {\S}\cdot \pmb {\S}')d\Omega ',
$$

where  $\Phi$  is the scattering phase function. Therefore, we may establish polar and azimuthal angles for scattering as

$$
R_{\psi} = \int_{0}^{\psi^{\prime}}\int_{0}^{\pi}\Phi (\pmb {\S}\cdot \pmb {\S}^{\prime})\sin \theta^{\prime}d\theta^{\prime}d\psi^{\prime}\bigg / \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\pi}\Phi (\pmb {\S}\cdot \pmb {\S}^{\prime})\sin \theta^{\prime}d\theta^{\prime}d\psi^{\prime}, \tag{21.23a}
$$

and

$$
R_{\theta} = \int_{0}^{\theta^{\prime}}\Phi (\pmb {\S}\cdot \pmb {\S}^{\prime})\sin \theta^{\prime}d\theta^{\prime}\bigg / \int_{0}^{\pi}\Phi (\pmb {\S}\cdot \pmb {\S}^{\prime})\sin \theta^{\prime}d\theta^{\prime}. \tag{21.23b}
$$

For linear anisotropic scattering, from equation (12.99),

$$
\Phi (\pmb {\S}\cdot \pmb {\S}^{\prime}) = 1 + A_{1}\pmb {\S}\cdot \pmb{\S}^{\prime} = 1 + A_{1}\cos \theta^{\prime}, \tag{21.24}
$$

where it is assumed that the polar angle  $\theta^{\prime}$  is measured from an axis pointing into the  $\S$  - direction, and the azimuthal angle  $\psi^{\prime}$  is measured in a plane normal to  $\S$ . Equations (21.23a) and (21.23b), then, reduce for linear anisotropic scattering to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_{\psi} = \frac{\psi^{\prime}}{2\pi},\mathrm{or}\psi^{\prime} = 2\pi R_{\psi},}\\ {R_{\theta} = \frac{1}{2}\Big(1 - \cos \theta^{\prime} + \frac{A_{1}}{2}\sin^{2}\theta^{\prime}\Big).} \end{array} \tag{21.25b}
$$

For isotropic scattering  $(A_{1}\equiv 0)$  these relations are identical to those for (by nature isotropic) emission, equations (21.13).

The new direction vector,  $\S^{\prime}$ , must then be found by introducing a local coordinate system at the point of scattering, with  $\S$  pointing into its  $z$ - direction (i.e., from where the polar angle

![](images/6bfe985ffb9de158a38ac97e12c81f80a827c6bde875a28d275a47a845a71e7d.jpg)  
FIGURE 21-1 Local coordinate system for scattering direction.

$\theta^{\prime}$  is measured), as shown in Fig. 21- 1. The local  $x$ - direction (from where  $\psi^{\prime}$  is measured) and  $y$ - direction are given by

$$
\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1 = \mathbf{a}\times \hat{\mathbf{s}} /\left|\mathbf{a}\times \hat{\mathbf{s}}\right|,\quad \hat{\mathbf{e}}_2 = \hat{\mathbf{s}}\times \hat{\mathbf{e}}_1, \tag{21.26}
$$

where  $\mathbf{a}$  is any arbitrary vector. The first of equations (21.26) ensures that the local  $x$ - axis is perpendicular to  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , and the second makes the coordinate system right- handed. Similar to equation (21.14), the new direction vector may now be expressed as

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime} = \sin \theta^{\prime}(\cos \psi^{\prime}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{1} + \sin \psi^{\prime}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{2}) + \cos \theta^{\prime}\hat{\mathbf{s}}. \tag{21.27}
$$

If scattering is isotropic the scattering direction does not depend on the original path  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$  (all directions are equally likely). In that case, the choice of a local coordinate is totally arbitrary, and equation (21.14) may be used directly.

Example 21.1. Consider again the geometry of Example 8.2. The medium within the diffuser is gray with absorption and scattering coefficients of  $\kappa r_{0} = 1$  and  $\sigma_{s}r_{0} = 2$ , respectively, and an anisotropy factor of  $A_{1} = 1$  (strong forward scattering). How far will the energy bundle of Example 8.3 travel before being absorbed and/or scattered, if random numbers  $R_{\kappa} = 0.200$  and  $R_{\sigma} = 0.082$  are drawn? If scattering occurs, determine the energy bundle's new direction after the scattering event, for  $R_{\psi} = 0.25$  and  $R_{\theta} = 0.13$ .

# Solution

From equations (21.17) and (21.20)  $l_{\kappa} = r_{0}\ln (1 / 0.20) = 1.61r_{0},$  and  $l_{\sigma} = (r_{0} / 2)\times \ln (1 / 0.082) = 1.25r_{0}$ . From Example 8.3 we know that the bundle must travel a distance of  $D = (2r_{0})\cos 0 / 0.8 = 2.5r_{0}$  before hitting the diffuser. Since  $l_{\sigma}< l_{\kappa}< D$ , this implies that the bundle will scatter before hitting the diffuser, after which it will travel another distance of  $l_{\kappa} - l_{\sigma} = 0.36r_{0}$  before being absorbed (over which distance it may be scattered again or hit a diffuser wall). The location at which the scattering occurs is, from equation (8.57),

$$
x = x_{e} + l_{\sigma}\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{i}} = 1.25r_{0}\times 0.8 = 1.0r_{0},y = 0,z = 1.25r_{0}\times 0.6 = 0.75r_{0}.
$$

From equations (21.25) we find  $\psi^{\prime} = 2\pi \times 0.25 = \pi /2$  and  $\cos \theta^{\prime} = 2\sqrt{1 - R_{\theta}} - 1 = 2\sqrt{1 - 0.13} - 1 = 0.8655,$  or  $\theta^{\prime} = 30^{\circ}$ . Here the polar angle  $\theta^{\prime}$  is measured from the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} = 0.8\hat{\mathbf{u}} +0.6\hat{\mathbf{k}}$  and  $\psi^{\prime}$  in the plane normal to it. At the scattering point we may introduce a local coordinate system with, say,  $\mathbf{a} = \hat{\mathbf{j}}$ , or

$$
\hat{\mathbf{e}}_1 = \hat{\mathbf{j}}\times \hat{\mathbf{s}} /\left|\hat{\mathbf{j}}\times \hat{\mathbf{s}}\right| = 0.6\hat{\mathbf{i}} -0.8\hat{\mathbf{k}},\quad \hat{\mathbf{e}}_2 = \hat{\mathbf{s}}\times \hat{\mathbf{e}}_1 = \hat{\mathbf{j}},
$$

and, from equation (21.27),

$$
\begin{array}{r}\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime} = \frac{1}{2} (0 + 1\times \hat{\mathbf{j}}) + \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{3} (0.8\hat{\mathbf{i}} -0.6\hat{\mathbf{k}}) = 0.4\sqrt{3}\hat{\mathbf{i}} +0.5\hat{\mathbf{j}} -0.3\sqrt{3}\hat{\mathbf{k}}. \end{array}
$$

# 21.4 TREATMENT OF SPECTRAL LINE STRUCTURE EFFECTS

21.4 TREATMENT OF SPECTRAL LINE STRUCTURE EFFECTSIf the participating medium contains an absorbing/emitting molecular gas, the gas will have a number of vibration- rotation bands, which in turn consist of thousands of overlapping spectral lines (cf. the discussion on gas properties in Chapter 11). The absorption coefficient becomes a strongly gyrating function of wavelength (cf. Fig. 11- 11), making the use of equation (21.11) (emission wavelength) and equation (21.16) (absorption location, requiring the determination of spectral absorption coefficients along the path) difficult, if not impractical:  $(i)$  many digits of accuracy are required in the evaluation of  $\lambda$  to ascertain whether emission occurs near a line center (with large  $\kappa_{\lambda}$ ) or between lines (small  $\kappa_{\lambda}$ ), and  $(ii)$  accurate knowledge of the spectral variation of  $\kappa_{\lambda}$  was not known until recently. A first attempt to include line structure effects was made by Modest [1], employing the narrow band models described in Chapter 11. With the advent of high- power computers as well as high- resolution spectroscopic databases line- by- line accurate Monte Carlo solutions have recently become reality. And, finally, with modern  $k$ - distributions rapidly replacing band models, the Monte Carlo method may also be used in conjunction with them.

# Narrow Band Model Monte Carlo

In order to find statistically meaningful emission wavelengths using the statistical narrow band models of Chapter 11, the absorption coefficient is first split into two components,

$$
\kappa_{\lambda} = \kappa_{p\lambda} + \kappa_{g\lambda}, \tag{21.28}
$$

where  $\kappa_{p\lambda}$  is the (spectrally smooth) absorption coefficient of other participating material (such as particles or ions), and  $\kappa_{g\lambda}$  is the rapidly varying gas absorption coefficient. Taking a narrow band average over the Planck function- weighted absorption coefficient leads to

$$
\int_0^\lambda \kappa_{g\lambda}I_{b\lambda}d\lambda = \int_0^\lambda \left(\frac{1}{\delta\lambda}\int_{\delta \lambda}\kappa_{g\lambda}I_{b\lambda}d\lambda '\right)d\lambda \simeq \int_0^\lambda \overline{\kappa}_{g\lambda}I_{b\lambda}d\lambda ,
$$

where  $\overline{\kappa}_{g\lambda} = (S / d)_{\lambda}$  is the narrow band average of the gas absorption coefficient. The wavelength of emission is determined with equation (21.11) from

$$
R_{\lambda} = \frac{\pi}{\left(\kappa_{pp} + \kappa_{gp}\right)\sigma T^{4}}\int_{0}^{\lambda}\left(\kappa_{p\lambda} + \overline{\kappa}_{g\lambda}\right)I_{b\lambda}d\lambda , \tag{21.29}
$$

and again, after inversion,

$$
\lambda = \lambda (R_{\lambda},x,y,z). \tag{21.30}
$$

Application of the narrow band model to find the location of absorption within the participating medium is somewhat more complicated. The random number relations are different for photon bundles emitted from a surface (with spectrally smooth emittance  $\epsilon_{\lambda}$ ), as opposed to bundles emitted from within the medium (with strongly varying absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{\lambda}$ ). Bundles emitted from a wall are equally likely to have wavelengths close to the center of a line or the gap between two lines, causing them to travel a certain distance before absorption. Bundles emitted from within the medium are likely to have wavelengths for which  $\kappa_{\lambda}$  is large [as easily seen by looking at equations (10.54) or (21.7) on a spectral basis], making them much more likely to be absorbed near the point of emission. We will limit our discussion here to the case of a spatially constant absorption coefficient, i.e.,  $\kappa_{\lambda} = \kappa_{\lambda}(\lambda)$ . The more general case of a spatially varying (i.e., temperature- and/or concentration- dependent) absorption coefficient may be found in the original paper of Modest [1].

The amount of energy emitted by a surface element  $dA$  over a wavelength range  $d\lambda$  into a pencil of rays  $d\Omega$  is

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}I_{b\lambda}dA_{p}d\lambda d\Omega ,
$$

where  $dA_{p} = dA|\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} |$  is the projected area normal to the pencil of rays. Of this, the amount

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}I_{b\lambda}dA_{p}d\lambda d\Omega e^{-\kappa_{\lambda}l}
$$

penetrates a distance  $l$  into the medium. Taking a narrow band average of both expressions leaves the first one untouched while the second becomes

$$
\epsilon_{\lambda}I_{b\lambda}dA_{p}d\lambda d\Omega \frac{1}{\delta\lambda}\int_{\delta \lambda}e^{-\kappa_{\lambda}l}d\lambda = \epsilon_{\lambda}I_{b\lambda}dA_{p}d\lambda d\Omega (1 - \overline{\alpha}_{\lambda}),
$$

where  $\overline{\alpha}_{\lambda}$  is the narrow band average of the spectral absorptivity. The ratio of the two expressions gives the fraction of energy traveling a distance  $l$ . Thus, using one of the narrow band models summarized in Table 11.1, we find

$$
R_{\kappa} = 1 - \overline{\alpha}_{\lambda}\simeq \exp \left(-\kappa_{p\lambda}l - \frac{\overline{W}}{d}\right), \tag{21.31}
$$

with  $\overline{W} /d$  from equation (11.68) (Elsasser model) or equations (11.77) through (11.79) (statistical models), for which  $\tau = \overline{\kappa}_{\lambda}l$  and  $\beta$  is the line overlap parameter. In the high- pressure limit (strong line overlap with  $\beta \rightarrow \infty$ ) equation (21.31) reduces to equation (21.16) for all narrow band models. Explicit inversion of equation (21.31) is possible only for the Malkmus model (unless  $\kappa_{p\lambda} = 0$ ).

If emission is from a volume element, we have for a volume  $dV$ , a wavelength range  $d\lambda$ , and a pencil of rays  $d\Omega$ , the total emitted energy

$$
\kappa_{\lambda}I_{b\lambda}dVd\lambda d\Omega ,
$$

of which the amount

$$
\kappa_{\lambda}I_{b\lambda}dVd\lambda d\Omega e^{-\kappa_{\lambda}l}
$$

is transmitted over a distance of  $l$ . Taking the narrow band average of both expressions and dividing the second by the first gives the transmitted fraction as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_{\kappa} = \frac{1}{\delta\lambda}\int_{\delta \lambda}\kappa_{\lambda}e^{-\kappa_{\lambda}l}d\lambda \Bigg / \frac{1}{\delta\lambda}\int_{\delta \lambda}\kappa_{\lambda}d\lambda}\\ {= -\frac{1}{\kappa_{p\lambda} + \overline{\kappa}_{g\lambda}}\frac{d}{dl}\Bigg(\frac{1}{\delta\lambda}\int_{\delta \lambda}e^{-\kappa_{\lambda}l}d\lambda \Bigg) = \frac{1}{\kappa_{p\lambda} + \overline{\kappa}_{g\lambda}}\frac{d\overline{\alpha}_{\lambda}}{dl} = \frac{\kappa_{p\lambda} + \frac{d}{dl}\Bigg(\frac{\overline{W}}{d}\Bigg)}{\kappa_{p\lambda} + \overline{\kappa}_{g\lambda}}\overline{\alpha}_{\lambda}.} \end{array} \tag{21.32}
$$

Again, equation (21.32) reduces to equation (21.16) for  $\beta \rightarrow \infty$ .

All other random number relations, since they do not involve the spectral absorption coefficient, are unaffected by spectral line effects.

Example 21.2. Consider a photon bundle traveling through a molecular gas. The wavelength of the bundle is such that  $\overline{\kappa}_{g\lambda} = 1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  and  $\beta = 0.1$ . Drawing a random number of  $R_{\kappa} = 0.200$ , how far will the bundle travel before absorption, if it was emitted  $(a)$  by a gray wall,  $(b)$  from within the gas? Use the Goody statistical model.

# Solution

$(a)$  If the bundle originates from a wall, we have from equation (21.31)

$$
R_{\kappa} = 0.200 = \exp \left(-\frac{\overline{W}}{d}\right) = \exp \left(-\frac{\tau}{\sqrt{1 + \tau / \beta}}\right) = \exp \left(-\frac{\tau}{\sqrt{1 + 10\tau}}\right).
$$

By trial and error (or solution of a quadratic equation), it follows that  $\tau = 25.9$  and  $l = \tau /\overline{\kappa}_{g\lambda} = 25.9\mathrm{cm}$ .  $(b)$  For medium emission, equation (21.32) is applicable, and

$$
\begin{array}{c}{R_{\kappa} = 0.200 = \frac{1}{\kappa_{g\lambda}}\frac{d}{dl}\left(\frac{\overline{W}}{d}\right) = \frac{d}{d\tau}\left(\frac{\overline{W}}{d}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \tau / \beta}}\frac{\beta + \tau / 2}{\beta + \tau}\exp \left(-\frac{\tau}{\sqrt{1 + \tau / \beta}}\right)}\\ {= \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + 10\tau}}\frac{1 + 5\tau}{1 + 10\tau} e^{-\tau /\sqrt{1 + 10\tau}},} \end{array}
$$

or  $\tau \simeq 0.48$  and  $l = 0.48\mathrm{cm}$

Therefore, as expected, the bundle travels much farther if emitted from a wall. For comparison, in a gray medium the bundle would have traveled

$$
l = \frac{1}{\kappa}\ln \frac{1}{R_{\kappa}} = \frac{1}{1\mathrm{cm}^{-1}}\ln \frac{1}{0.200} = 1.61\mathrm{cm}
$$

for both cases.

Some Monte Carlo results for gas- particulate mixtures with line structure effects are shown in Chapter 20, in Fig. 20- 3.

# Line-by-Line Monte Carlo

As indicated in the beginning of this chapter, Monte Carlo methods tend to be CPU time intensive, but they can be applied to very advanced problems without drastically increasing computational effort. Therefore, unlike line- by- line (LBL) accurate conventional RTE solutions (requiring upwards of 1 million spectral RTE solutions), LBL- accurate Monte Carlo calculations can essentially be had for the price of a gray simulation, provided  $(i)$  emission wavelengths and spectral absorption coefficients can be determined efficiently, and  $(ii)$  the data storage requirements do not become excessive. The first LBL Monte Carlo scheme was implemented by Wang and Modest [2], who considered mixtures of  $\mathrm{CO_2}$  and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  at combustion conditions. Considering that the absorption coefficients of individual species in a mixture are additive,

$$
\kappa_{\lambda} = \sum_{i}\kappa_{\lambda ,i} = \sum_{i}\kappa_{p\lambda ,i}p_{i}\quad \mathrm{and}\quad \kappa_{p\lambda} = \kappa_{\lambda} / p = \sum_{i}x_{i}\kappa_{p\lambda ,i}, \tag{21.33}
$$

where  $\kappa_{p\lambda}$  is the pressure- based absorption coefficient,  $x_{i} = p_{i} / p$  is the mole fraction of species  $i,$  and  $p$  is the total pressure of the mixture, one can obtain the random- number relation for the gas mixture as

$$
\begin{array}{l}{R_{\lambda} = \frac{\pi}{\kappa_{p}\sigma T^{4}}\int_{0}^{\lambda}\kappa_{p\lambda}I_{b\lambda}\mathrm{d}\lambda = \frac{\pi}{\sigma T^{4}\sum_{i}x_{i}\kappa_{p,i}}\int_{0}^{\lambda}\sum_{i}x_{i}\kappa_{p\lambda}I_{b\lambda}\mathrm{d}\lambda}\\ {= \frac{\pi}{\sigma T^{4}\sum_{i}x_{i}\kappa_{p,i}}\sum_{i}x_{i}\int_{0}^{\lambda}\kappa_{p\lambda}I_{b\lambda}\mathrm{d}\lambda = \sum_{i}x_{i}\kappa_{p,i}R_{\lambda ,i}\int_{i}\sum_{i}x_{i}\kappa_{p,i},} \end{array} \tag{21.35}
$$

where

$$
R_{\lambda ,i} = \frac{\int_0^\lambda\kappa_{\lambda,i}I_{b\lambda}d\lambda}{\int_0^\infty\kappa_{\lambda,i}I_{b\lambda}d\lambda} = \frac{\int_0^\lambda\kappa_{p\lambda,i}I_{b\lambda}d\lambda}{\int_0^\infty\kappa_{p,i}\lambda_{i}I_{b\lambda}d\lambda} = \frac{\pi}{\kappa_{p,i}\sigma T^4}\int_0^\lambda \kappa_{p\lambda ,i}I_{b\lambda}d\lambda , \tag{21.36}
$$

is the emission wavelength random number for species  $i,$  and  $\kappa_{p,i}$  is the pressure- based Planck- mean absorption coefficient. Equation (21.34) establishes a direct relation between the mixture random number  $R_{\lambda}$  and species random numbers  $\{R_{\lambda ,i}\}$ . Since the relation between the mixture random number  $R_{\lambda}$  and the corresponding wavelength  $\lambda$  is a complicated implicit expression, the emission wavelength is found by trial- and- error. First an emission wavelength is guessed,

![](images/beb8a40df9d7bee0775cb5fe25da48f3da53b398c59cee91c5f94cefce5ac797.jpg)  
FIGURE 21-2 Random number and absorption coefficient distributions in a small spectral interval [2].

and then the species random numbers  $\{R_{\lambda ,i}\}$  are determined, followed by the calculation of  $R_{\lambda}$  through equation (21.34). Figure 21- 2 (given in terms of wavenumber, rather than wavelength) shows the random number and corresponding absorption coefficient distributions of a gas mixture in a small spectral interval. Although the random number is a monotonically increasing function, it has strongly varying gradients even in such a small interval. A small error in random number may result in a significant deviation in absorption coefficient. Therefore, common root- finding techniques relying on smooth gradients, such as the Newton- Raphson method, cannot be used here to invert random numbers; instead, a bisectional search algorithm was employed.

For absorption calculations, the desired mixture absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{\lambda}$  at a given wavelength can be directly calculated from species pressure- based absorption coefficients  $\{\kappa_{p\lambda ,i}\}$  through equation (21.33). Therefore, a database tabulating both  $R_{\lambda ,i} - \lambda$  and  $\kappa_{p\lambda ,i} - \lambda$  relations of each species can be utilized to determine emission wavelengths and absorption coefficients for the mixture, and such a database can be constructed once and for all. If the total pressure is fixed, both the species random number, as in equation (21.36), and the pressure- based absorption coefficient are functions of wavelength, temperature, and species concentration only, i.e.,

$$
R_{\lambda ,i} = f_{\lambda ,i}(\lambda ,T,x_i),\quad \kappa_{p\lambda ,i} = f_{\kappa ,i}(\lambda ,T,x_i),\quad i = 1,2,\dots,I, \tag{21.37}
$$

where  $I$  is the number of species.  $R_{\lambda ,i}$  and  $\kappa_{p\lambda ,i}$  are functions of temperature and wavelength only, and a 3D interpolation scheme is sufficient for the database and the computational effort increases only linearly with increasing number of species. Several 2D axisymmetric example problems were calculated using the mocacyl. f code of Appendix F, leading to two important conclusions:

1. Very respectable LBL accuracy can be obtained with very few photon bundles; e.g., as few as 30,000 bundles produced relative standard deviations of  $< 2\%$  (vs. the need of 1 million or so conventional RTE solutions). Apparently (in optically thin to intermediate media), spectral regions with large absorption coefficients contribute most to the heat transfer, and such wavelengths are chosen preferentially by the Monte Carlo method. 
2. Computer time was dominated by spectral property calculations (primarily determination of emission wavelengths), indicating the need to make these evaluations as efficient as possible.

Ozawa et al. [3] generated an LBL- accurate Monte Carlo scheme for nonequilibrium plasmas found in hypersonic atmospheric entry of space vehicles. They realized that overlap between species is of no consequence for emission, i.e., equation (21.11) may be rescaled in terms of emitting species as

$$
R_{\lambda} = \frac{1}{\sum_{i = 1}^{I}j_{i}}\left(\sum_{i = 1}^{k - 1}j_{i} + \int_{0}^{\lambda}j_{k\lambda}d\lambda\right), \tag{21.38}
$$

where  $j_{k\lambda}$  is the emission coefficient of species  $k\left[= \kappa_{k\lambda}I_{b\lambda}\right.$  for equilibrium conditions; cf. equation (11.22)]. Separating, for emission, first the emitting species before finding an emission wavelength results in the same total emission as direct application of equation (21.34). Thus, based on a given emission wavelength random number, they first determined the emitting species  $k$  from

$$
\frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{k - 1}j_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^{I}j_i} < R_{\lambda}\leq \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{k}j_i}{\sum_{i = 1}^{I}j_i}. \tag{21.39}
$$

The random number is then rescaled to

$$
0< R_{k\lambda} = \frac{R_{\lambda}\sum_{i = 1}^{I}j_{i} - \sum_{i = 1}^{k - 1}j_{i}}{j_{k}}\leq 1, \tag{21.40}
$$

and an emission wavelength is found from

$$
R_{k\lambda} = \frac{1}{j_k}\intop_0^{\lambda}j_{k\lambda}d\lambda . \tag{21.41}
$$

In equilibrium applications (such as combustion)  $j_{k\lambda} = \kappa_{k\lambda}I_{b\lambda}$  is a function of only  $(\lambda ,T,x_{k})$  and  $\lambda = \lambda (R_{k\lambda},T,x_{k})$  is readily databased and  $\lambda$  found by simple interpolation; no costly trial- and- error solution is required. In nonequilibrium applications  $j_{k\lambda}$  can depend on many parameters (four temperatures, electronic level populations, number densities of ions, electrons, and neutrals), and a trial- and- error procedure was used by Ozawa et al. [3] to solve equation (21.41). In very recent work by Feldick and Modest [4] it was recognized that, within a given species, emission from individual lines is also independent of overlap, and the scaling process of equation (21.40) can be repeated by choosing an individual electronic transition, then a vibrational one, and finally an individual line, for which equation (21.41) can be inverted analytically (for Lorentz and Doppler line shapes).

# FSCK Monte Carlo

The Monte Carlo method may also be combined with the full- spectrum  $k$ - distribution (FSCK) model of Chapter 20, as was first done by Wang et al. [5], while the related ADF method was employed by Maurente and coworkers [6]. If one compares the general RTE, e.g., equation (10.21), with the transformed FSCK RTE, equation (20.128), it is apparent that the emission term  $\kappa_{\lambda}I_{b\lambda}$  is replaced by  $k^{\ast}(T_{0},\underline{\phi},g_{0})a(T,T_{0},g_{0})I_{b}(T),g_{0}$  is the new spectral variable, and the absorption coefficient becomes  $k^{\ast}(\overline{T_{0}},\underline{\phi},g_{0})$ . Thus, a Monte Carlo simulation can be done by simply replacing actual spectral data by reordered emission and absorption as a function of the new spectral variable. Proper emission rescaled "wavelengths"  $g_{0}$  are then found from equation (21.11) as

$$
R_{g} = \frac{\int_{0}^{g}k(T_{0},\underline{\phi},g)a(T,T_{0},g)I_{b}(T)dg}{\int_{0}^{1}k(T_{0},\underline{\phi},g)a(T,T_{0},g)I_{b}(T)dg} = \frac{\int_{0}^{g}k(T_{0},\underline{\phi},g)a(T,T_{0},g)dg}{\int_{0}^{1}k(T_{0},\underline{\phi},g)a(T,T_{0},g)dg}, \tag{21.42}
$$

since  $I_{b}$  does not depend on  $g_{0}$ . The denominator is the local Planck- mean absorption coefficient. In contrast to the oscillatory variation of the spectral absorption coefficient, e.g., Fig. 11- 11, the variations of  $k^{*}$  and  $a$  with  $g_{0}$  are much smoother as shown, e.g., in Fig. 20- 13. A number of data points on the order of 100 is sufficient to represent these smooth  $k$ - and  $a$ - distributions. Memory requirements are thus no longer an issue if the FSCK method is used in the Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, the number of photons needed to resolve the spectral variation during one Monte Carlo trial is somewhat reduced. On the negative side, mixture  $k$ - distributions must be preassembled from databases for all possible states, as described in Chapter 20, which is no trivial task (although it needs to be done only once, provided the reference state of the mixture remains fairly constant in a transient or iterative solution environment). However, absorption coefficients of different species can no longer be separated, and  $g_{0}(R_{g}, \phi)$  and  $k^{*}(g_{0}, \phi)$  must be found from  $I + 2$ - order interpolation in a mixture with  $I$  radiating species. Wang and Modest [2] found FSCK Monte Carlo to speed up calculations by about a factor of 4 for similar amounts of photon bundles, while also reducing standard deviations by 10–20%. Much greater speed- ups of up to a factor of 20 can be obtained in nonequilibrium applications, where radiative property evaluations are exceedingly expensive.

# 21.5 OVERALL ENERGY CONSERVATION

The temperature field within the medium is determined from overall conservation of energy, as given by equation (10.72). In the absence of conduction and convection, i.e., if radiative equilibrium prevails, this equation reduces to the simple form of  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{R}} = 0$ , where  $\mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{R}}$  is the radiative heat flux. Whether an analytical technique or a Monte Carlo method is used, the solution is simplest for a gray medium at radiative equilibrium, followed by the case of radiative equilibrium in a nongray medium and, finally, the gray and nongray medium in the presence of conduction and/or convection.

# Gray Medium at Radiative Equilibrium

Radiative equilibrium implies that anywhere within the medium the material absorbs precisely as much radiative energy as it emits. Therefore, for every photon bundle absorbed at location  $\mathbf{r}$ , another photon bundle of the same strength must be emitted at the same location. The direction of the new photon is determined from equations (21.13). We note that these relations are identical to those for isotropic scattering, equations (21.25), since emission is always isotropic. The wavelength of the newly emitted energy bundle may be determined from equation (21.11) and depends on the local temperature. However, if the medium and the walls are gray, then the wavelength of the bundle is irrelevant (indeed, does not have to be determined). Thus, if absorption and scattering coefficients are independent of temperature, knowledge of the temperature field is not required to find the solution: Energy bundles are emitted from the bounding walls (according to their temperatures) and are followed until they are absorbed by a wall (after perhaps numerous scattering and absorption- reemission events inside the medium). Numerically, the process is identical to a purely scattering medium, with the extinction coefficient  $\beta = \kappa + \sigma_{\mathrm{s}}$  replaced by an effective scattering coefficient  $\sigma_{\mathrm{s}}^{\prime} = \beta$ . The temperature field inside the medium is determined by keeping track of the total reemitted energy from a control volume  $V_{i}$ :

$$
Q_{\mathsf{abs},i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N_i}Q_{ij} = Q_{\mathsf{em},i} = 4\sigma \kappa_iT_i^4 V_i, \tag{21.43}
$$

or

$$
T_{i} = \left(\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}Q_{ij}\big / 4\sigma \kappa_{i}V_{i}\right)^{1 / 4}, \tag{21.44}
$$

where the  $Q_{ij}$  are the amounts of energy carried by the  $N_{i}$  photon bundles that have been absorbed within  $V_{i}$  (after emission from a wall and, possibly, reemission from within the medium).

This solution is limited to the case of constant properties, since absorption and scattering locations depend on local values of absorption and scattering coefficients. If these properties depend on temperature, a temperature field must be guessed to determine them, and an iteration becomes necessary.

# Nongray Medium at Radiative Equilibrium

If the medium is nongray, the wavelength of each reemitted bundle must be determined from equation (21.11), requiring knowledge of the temperature field. Therefore, the solution becomes an iterative process: First a temperature field is guessed, and employing this guess, the solution proceeds similar to the one described above for a gray medium, after which local temperatures are recalculated from equation (21.44), etc., until the solution converges.

There is another way to obtain a solution. Based on the guess of the temperature field we "know" how much energy is emitted from each subvolume. We may therefore separate the emission and absorption processes: Photon bundles are emitted not only by the walls, but also by the medium, and they are then traced until they are absorbed by either wall or medium (i.e., there is no reemission in this method). This leads to different values for  $Q_{\mathrm{abs,i}}$  and  $Q_{\mathrm{em,i}}$  in equation (21.43), which may be used to update the temperature field. This method of solution is usually inferior since emission depends very strongly on the (unknown) temperature field, while nongray behavior is only implicitly influenced by the temperature.

# Coupling with Conduction and/or Convection

If conduction and/or convection are of importance the radiation problem must be solved simultaneously with overall conservation of energy, equation (10.72). Since the energy equation is usually solved by conventional numerical methods (although a Monte Carlo solution is, in principle, possible; see, e.g., Haji- Sheikh [7]), an iteration in the temperature field is necessary: Similar to radiative equilibrium in a nongray medium a temperature field is guessed and used to solve the radiation problem, leading to volume emission rates,  $Q_{\mathrm{em,i}}$ , and absorption rates,  $Q_{\mathrm{abs,i}}$ , for each subvolume. The net radiative source is then

$$
(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}_R)_i = \frac{1}{V_i} (Q_{\mathrm{em,i}} - Q_{\mathrm{abs,i}}), \tag{21.45}
$$

which is substituted into the solution for equation (10.72) to predict an updated temperature field. Because of the statistical uncertainties in the Monte Carlo calculations, this may lead to instabilities. The tight convergence standards normally applied to finite difference/volume iterations must be loosened considerably. If quasi- steady turbulence is treated through stochastic particle fields (i.e., by a Monte Carlo method applied to the flow), radiation Monte Carlo schemes blend naturally with the turbulence model and can be very efficient [8,9] (see following section). Tight coupling with a quasi- steady fully finite- volume flow code can also be achieved through time- blending (limited sampling during a given iteration blended with the solution from previous iterations) [10].

# 21.6 DISCRETE PARTICLE FIELDS

In modern combustion simulations it is becoming common to represent pulverized coal and fuel sprays through Lagrangian discrete particle fields, e.g., [11, 12]. Turbulent combustion models use stochastic probability density function (PDF) models to resolve the nonlinear turbulence- chemistry interaction term, in which the fluid is represented by a large number of notional point masses (see discussion in Chapter 22). To simulate the radiative transfer process by ray tracing

FIGURE 21-3 Discrete particle field representations of a 2D medium: (a) PPM representation; (b) SPM/CDS representation of a sub-region in (a); (c) Cone-PPM scheme

in a discrete particle field, the interaction between infinitesimal point- masses and infinitesimally thin photon rays needs to be modeled. This can be done by assigning effective volumes to the point- masses, by assigning an influence volume to the ray's trajectory, or a combination of both. In this section, several particle models and ray models are developed, as well as photon emission and absorption algorithms based on these models. More detail can be found in the original papers of Wang and Modest [13,14]. Their work dealt with stochastic particles used in turbulence modeling, and we will describe the method in this context. However, with very minor modifications the model is also directly applicable to physical particle fields.

# Particle and Photon Ray Models

Point Particle Model (PPM) In this model, particles are treated as point- masses, i.e., they carry an amount of mass without a specific shape at a certain spatial location as shown in Fig. 21- 3a, which is a 2D particle field. The only geometric information known about the particles is their position vector  $\mathbf{r}_i$ . However, particles do have a nominal volume, which may be calculated from their thermophysical properties such as pressure and temperature. For example, for stochastic fluid particles, if the ideal gas assumption is adopted, the nominal volume may be computed as

$$
V_{i} = \frac{m_{i}RT_{i}}{p_{i}}, \tag{21.46}
$$

where  $m_i$  is the mass carried by particle  $i$ ,  $T_i$  is its temperature,  $p_i$  is its total pressure, and  $R$  is the gas constant. To enforce consistency in the discrete particle representation of the medium, the overall nominal volume of all particles should be the same as the actual geometric expanse of the medium. As a consequence, one may regard the nominal volume of a particle as its real volume.

The Point Particle Model only contains the particle information that the original discrete particle field contains. It does not employ any other assumption and, therefore, it will not induce any inconsistency. The disadvantage of this model is that it is difficult to determine the interaction of a photon ray with a volume without shape.

Spherical Particle Model (SPM) In this method, each point- mass  $m_i$  has a spherical influence region  $\Omega_i$ , surrounding it as shown in Fig. 21- 3b. The mass is distributed to its influence region according to a density profile  $\hat{\rho}$ ,  $R_i$  is its influence radius, and  $\rho_i$  is the nominal density calculated by

$$
\rho_{i} = \frac{m_{i}}{V_{i}} = \frac{p_{i}}{RT_{i}}, \tag{21.47}
$$

so that the total mass in the influence region is equal to the point- mass. In this method, particles are assigned a spherical volume (influence region) with varying density, and overlapping other particles in the domain. Here we consider only the case of constant density spheres with a radius determined by their nominal volumes,

$$
R_{i} = \left(\frac{3V_{i}}{4\pi}\right)^{1 / 3}, \tag{21.48}
$$

termed the Constant Density Sphere (CDS) model. The overall density at an arbitrary position is the sum of density contributions from all nearby particles. Some locations may be influenced by more than one particle, while some other locations may not be in the influence region of any particle, i.e., there is a void in these places. Therefore, this model cannot recover a continuous density medium as shown in Fig. 21- 3b, which is a small portion of the CDS representation of the 2D field given in Fig. 21- 3a (if variable density were employed, the  $R_{i}$  would be larger, resulting in substantial overlap, even in this region of few particles). A location with lots of void space was chosen for better readability. In order to show particle locations in a plane, a 2D rather than 3D particle field is depicted.

Line Ray Model In this model, a ray is simply treated as a volume- less line and energy propagates one- dimensionally along the line. This is the standard model for ray tracing in continuous media. Since such rays are not designed to have a specific volume, they are not able to interact with point- masses. Therefore, this model requires volumetric particle models for radiative transfer simulations.

Cone Ray Model Physically, a photon bundle consists of many millions of individual photons, occupying a small solid angle. Thus, to model the volume of a ray, one may assign a small solid angle to the ray and treat it as a cone. Energy is assumed to propagate axisymmetrically along the cone, with its strength decaying in the radial direction normal to the cone axis, similar to the varying particle density in the spherical particle model. For a ray emitted at  $\mathbf{r}_0$  into a direction given by a unit direction vector  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ , the intensity at location  $\mathbf{r}$  within the ray's cone can then be modeled as

$$
I(s,r) = I_{o}(s)w_{c}(r / R_{c}(s)), \tag{21.49}
$$

where  $s = (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_0)\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}}$  is the distance from the emission location to a point on the ray axis,  $r$  is the distance from a point to the ray axis on a plane normal to the axis,  $I_{o}(s)$  is the intensity at the ray center,  $R_{c}(S)$  is the local influence radius of the cross- section as depicted in Fig. 21- 3c, and  $w_{c}$  is a normalized two- dimensional center- symmetric profile, which satisfies

$$
\frac{2}{R_c^2}\int_0^{R_c}w_c(r)rdr = 1. \tag{21.50}
$$

Again, many weight functions are possible, ranging from  $w_{c} = 1$  to Gaussian decay. A popular Gaussian- like weight function is given by [15]. Physically, the distribution of energy emitted from a point is isotropic in all directions. Different rays from the same point may overlap if rays have a volume. The Gaussian decay of energy along the radial direction provides a smoother overlap than a uniform energy distribution across the cone cross- section. Since in this model the ray has a specific volume, volume- less particles can be intercepted by the ray, and this model can work together with the Point Particle Model.

# Emission from a Particle

A small gas volume emits energy uniformly into all directions. In Monte Carlo simulations, the total energy is divided into a number of photon bundles (rays) which are released into random directions. In a physical gas volume, the emitted energy comes from every point in the volume. If the medium is represented by discrete particles, emission takes place inside these

particles. Thus, depending on the optical thickness of the particle, and the point and direction of emission, some of the emitted energy may not escape from the particle due to self- absorption. If the particle is optically thin, the self- absorption of emission is negligible and the total emission from particle  $i$  is calculated from equation (10.54):

$$
Q_{\mathrm{em},i} = 4\kappa_{\rho ,i}m_i\sigma T_i^4, \tag{21.51}
$$

where  $\kappa_{\rho ,i}$  is the density- based Planck- mean absorption coefficient at particle temperature  $T_{i}$ . If self- absorption is considered and the particle is assumed to be a constant density sphere, the total emission from a sphere is obtained from Example 10.3 as

$$
Q_{\mathrm{em},i} = 4\pi R_i^2\sigma T_i^4\left\{1 - \frac{1}{2\tau_i^2}\left[1 - (1 + 2\tau_i)e^{-2i}\right]\right\} , \tag{21.52}
$$

where  $\tau_{i} = \rho_{i}\kappa_{\rho ,i}R_{i}$  is the optical thickness of the spherical volume based on the nominal radius. In the Point Particle Model, the shape of a particle is arbitrary, but equation (21.52) is still a good approximation of total emission from such a particle. If more than one ray is emitted from a particle, the sum of initial energy carried by all rays must be equal to the total emission calculated from equation (21.51) or equation (21.52), depending on whether self- absorption is neglected.

The number of rays emitted by a specific particle should be determined by the total emission of the particle, guided by the average value of energy that the rays carry, i.e.,

$$
Q_{\mathrm{avg}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N_p}Q_{\mathrm{em},i}\big / N_r, \tag{21.53}
$$

where  $N_{p}$  is the total number of particles in the computational domain and  $N_{r}$  is the prescribed total number of rays to trace. The range of ray energy  $[Q_{\mathrm{min}},Q_{\mathrm{max}}]$  can be chosen around the average ray energy,

$$
Q_{\mathrm{min}}< Q_{\mathrm{avg}}< Q_{\mathrm{max}}, \tag{21.54}
$$

since the total emission from a particle cannot be expected to be an integer multiple of the average ray energy. If the total emission of a particle is in the range defined in equation (21.54), its total energy will be lumped into one ray. However, particles in hot zones of the medium tend to emit more energy, and if the total emission of particle  $i$  exceeds the maximum ray energy, it needs to emit more than one ray in order for each ray to obey equation (21.54). The number of rays emitted by particle  $i$  can be determined from

$$
N_{r,i} = \lfloor Q_{\mathrm{em},i} / Q_{\mathrm{avg}} + 0.5\rfloor , \tag{21.55}
$$

with  $\lfloor x\rfloor$  being the largest integer  $\leq x$ . The individual bundles' strengths leaving particle  $i$  as ray  $j$  is then

$$
Q_{i,j} = Q_{\mathrm{em},i} / N_{r,i}. \tag{21.56}
$$

Because the energy of each ray should also satisfy equation (21.54), a requirement of choosing the ray energy range is obtained as

$$
Q_{\mathrm{max}}\geq 2Q_{\mathrm{min}}. \tag{21.57}
$$

One convenient choice is

$$
Q_{\mathrm{min}} = \frac{2}{3} Q_{\mathrm{avg}}\quad \mathrm{and}\quad Q_{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{4}{3} Q_{\mathrm{avg}}. \tag{21.58}
$$

In cold zones particles emit little energy and, for increased efficiency, it is advantageous to combine the emission of several particles into one ray. To be meaningful, a low- emission

particle should be combined with particles in its close proximity. In modeling of combustion flows a finite- volume mesh is often used to control the particle number density and resolve different levels of gradients. Particle size and other properties tend to be relatively uniform in a single finite- volume cell, which means that a low- emission particle tends to be surrounded by other low- emission particles. Therefore, the finite- volume mesh can be utilized to search low- emission particles and combine their emission. The emission point of the resultant ray is then determined as

$$
\mathbf{r} = \sum_{c}Q_{\mathrm{em},c}\mathbf{r}_{c}\big / \sum_{c}Q_{\mathrm{em},c}, \tag{21.59}
$$

where the subscript  $c$  denotes those particles combined together. Equation (21.57) also guarantees that the resultant ray energy falls into the prescribed ray energy range during the particle emission combination process.

# Absorption Models

The basic task of simulating the absorption of a photon bundle in a medium described by a point particle field is the evaluation of the optical thickness that a ray traverses along its path. This is achieved by modeling the interaction between the ray and the particles that it encounters. Based on different models employed for rays and particles, several schemes for absorption simulation may be obtained.

Line- SPM Scheme In this scheme, the ray is treated as a line and the Spherical Particle Model (SPM) is employed for the particles as shown in Fig. 21- 3b. If the Constant Density Sphere (CDS) model is employed, the mass of the particle is distributed uniformly across its influence region and the optical thickness that ray  $j$  passes through is computed as

$$
\Delta \tau_{ij} = 2\rho_i\kappa_{\rho ,i}\sqrt{R_i^2 - r_{ij}^2}, \tag{21.60}
$$

where  $r_{ij}$  is the distance from the center of particle  $i$  to ray  $j$ , as indicated in Fig. 21- 3b.

The total optical thickness that ray  $j$  passes through is simply the summation of the contributions from the individual particles it interacts with,

$$
\tau_{j} = \sum_{i\in I_{j}}\Delta \tau_{ij}, \tag{21.61}
$$

where  $I_{j}$  denotes all the particles intersected by ray  $j$ .

Cone- PPM Scheme If the ray is modeled as a cone, it is possible to let it interact with point particles. The energy change of a conical ray when it traverses over a small distance  $ds$  in a continuous medium is

$$
dE(s) = -\int_{0}^{R_c}\kappa dsI(r)2\pi rdr = -\overline{\kappa} ds\int_{0}^{R_c}I(r)2\pi rdr = -E(s)\overline{\kappa} ds, \tag{21.62}
$$

where  $E(s)$  is the plane- integrated energy over the cone cross- section at axial location  $s$ ,  $\kappa (s)$  is the local absorption coefficient,  $\overline{\kappa} (s)$  is the plane- averaged absorption coefficient, and  $R_{c}(s)$  is the local radius of the cone's cross- section. The plane- averaged absorption coefficient can be derived as

$$
\overline{\kappa} = \frac{\int_{0}^{R_{c}}\kappa I r d r}{\int_{0}^{R_{c}}I r d r} = \frac{\int_{0}^{R_{c}}\kappa w_{c}r d r}{\int_{0}^{R_{c}}w_{c}r d r} = \frac{2}{R_{c}^{2}}\int_{0}^{R_{c}}\kappa w_{c}r d r. \tag{21.63}
$$

Limiting ourselves again to constant weights  $(w_{c} = 1)$ ,

$$
\overline{\kappa} = \frac{2}{R_c^2}\int_0^1\kappa rdr. \tag{21.64}
$$

Therefore, the total optical thickness that ray  $j$  passes through along  $S$  is

$$
\tau = -\ln \frac{E(S)}{E(0)} = -\int_{S}\frac{dE}{E} = \int_{S}\overline{\kappa} ds = \int_{S}\int_{0}^{R_{c}}\frac{\kappa}{\pi R_{c}^{2}} 2\pi rdrds = \int_{V_{j}}\frac{\kappa}{\pi R_{c}^{2}} dV, \tag{21.65}
$$

where  $V_{j}$  is the volume that the ray covers in its path.

In discrete particle fields as shown in Fig. 21- 3c, the absorption coefficient is represented by a set of Dirac delta functions, $^{2}$

$$
\kappa = \sum_{i}\kappa_{i}V_{i}\delta (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_{i}). \tag{21.66}
$$

Integration over  $V_{j}$  yields

$$
\tau = \sum_{i\in I}\frac{\kappa_iV_i}{\pi R_{c,i}^2} = \sum_{i\in I}\frac{\kappa_{\rho,i}m_i}{\pi R_{c,i}^2}, \tag{21.67}
$$

where  $I$  denotes all the particles enclosed by the cone.

Cone- SPM Scheme In the most advanced scheme, the ray is treated as a cone, and the particle is given a specific shape and a density distribution may exist across its volume, as described in [13]. All three absorption models were found to be roughly equally accurate, with the Cone- SPM scheme slightly better, but somewhat more involved and expensive.

# Implementation Considerations

In order to evaluate and compare the performance of the different schemes for Monte Carlo ray tracing in media represented by statistical (or physical) particles, one- dimensional radiative heat transfer problems in a nonscattering gray gaseous medium were studied. Two media were considered: a 1D gas slab bounded by two infinitely large, parallel, cold, black walls and a gas sphere surrounded by a cold black wall. The thickness of the slab and the radius of the sphere were fixed, while temperature and density (or absorption coefficient) were varied across the slab thickness or along the sphere radial direction. The resulting radiative heat flux at the boundary were compared with exact values found through numerical integration.

In the slab problem, the 1D medium was simulated by repeating a gas cube, each with equal side lengths in the two infinite dimensions. A single gas cube is then taken as the computational domain in the Monte Carlo simulation. In the sphere problem, the computational domain is the gas sphere itself. The continuous gas medium in both problems is represented by a number of discrete gas particles randomly placed inside the computational domain. The mass of particles can be equally sized or have a distribution function. For computational efficiency, a mesh of cubic cells is laid on top of the computational domain because the ray- tracing algorithm on smaller cubic cells is simpler and more efficient. The same cubic- cell mesh is used for the sphere problem as well. In the slab problem each of the cells contains a number of gas particles, while in the sphere problem some cells at the corners of the mesh may contain no particles, because they may be outside the spherical computational domain. If the Point Particle Model (PPM) is employed, it can be assumed that each particle is completely enclosed by a single cell, since the shape of particles is not specified. However, if the Spherical Particle Model (SPM) is employed, the cells contain not only the particles with their center in it, but also parts of particles from neighboring cells. Thus, a scheme must be developed to avoid having the ray interact with a single particle more than once, since a single particle may belong to multiple cells.

When the Cone Ray Model is adopted for ray tracing, the opening angle (the angle between the cone axis and its lateral surface) needs to be chosen. Larger opening angles result in more particles caught by the ray, requiring more CPU time per ray. At the same time, larger opening angles reduce the statistical scatter (i.e., reduce the number of required photon bundles for a given desired standard deviation), while also smoothing out gradients that may exist in

![](images/b1aba1b76f3270b047348c6b1a2d001c1d8d2147d4a37b8e4db78268613e4d5f.jpg)  
FIGURE 21-4Figure of merit (FoM) of Cone Ray Models at different cone opening angles;  $50 \times 10,000$  equally-sized particles; 1 ray/particle; homogeneous medium.

the solution. For example, in turbulent flow fields large opening angles may smooth out the turbulence. The "figure of merit" (FoM) of a Monte Carlo simulation is defined as [16]

$$
\mathrm{F o M} = \frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}t},\quad \epsilon = \left(\frac{1}{S}\sum_{s = 1}^{S}(q_{s} / q^{0} - 1)^{2}\right)^{1 / 2} \tag{21.68}
$$

where  $\epsilon$  is the root- mean- square (RMS) relative error of the simulation and  $t$  is the simulation time. Here, the error of 50 simulations was employed for  $\epsilon$  ( $S = 50$ ).  $q_{s}$  is the simulation result of radiative flux at the boundary and  $q^{0}$  is the exact solution. A good Monte Carlo simulation should have a high FoM score. Figure 21- 4 shows FoM scores for different opening angles. The gas slab or sphere was represented by 10,000 randomly distributed, equally sized particles, each of which emits all its energy into a single random direction. Temperature and absorption coefficient are uniform and, thus, the smoothing effect of larger cone angles is not an issue. The mesh in use contains  $5 \times 5 \times 5 = 125$  cubic cells. As seen from Fig. 21- 4, for this one- dimensional problem  $1^{\circ}$  is the optimal opening angle, which can achieve high accuracy as well as high CPU efficiency. Although smaller opening angles required less computational time, their errors were larger, because they could not interact with enough particles. Similar results were also obtained for other temperature and absorption coefficient profiles.

Another factor that can affect the simulation speed is the number of particles per cell. When a ray is traced, the cells that it travels through are identified first. Then all particles in those cells are checked for interaction with the ray. For a finer mesh, the number of particles per cell is smaller and, thus, a smaller number of particles are checked during ray tracing. However, more cells must be searched. Thus, finer meshes tend to reduce the time spent on checking particles for their interaction with a ray, but increase the overhead related to cell searching and recording. It was found that no optimal cell size exists for the Line- CDS scheme; the computational time decreases consistently with decrease of cell size. For Cone schemes, however, an optimal value was found to be around 50 particles/cell in both the slab and the sphere problems.

# 21.7 EFFICIENCY CONSIDERATIONS

Monte Carlo calculations in the presence of a participating medium are generally even more computationally intensive than those for surface exchange, making efficiency considerations all the more important. All efficiency improvements introduced in Chapter 8 continue to hold in

participating media, such as inversion of random number relations in terms of look- up tables and interpolation from precalculated databases, energy partitioning, etc.

In optically thick media, bundles emitted in the interior rarely travel far enough (before absorption) to hit a bounding surface, although it is usually the surface heat fluxes that are of primary interest. Modest [17] extended the partitioning concept by depleting the energy content of a bundle along its path: No random number is drawn to determine the distance traveled until absorption, equation (21.17); rather, the energy content is depleted due to gradual absorption. The depleted amount is added to the absorption rates of the subvolumes through which the bundle travels. Again, the bundle is traced until it leaves the enclosure or until its energy is depleted. An illustration of this method is included with Example 21.4 for the backward Monte Carlo method in the following section. A similar method is also described by Walters and Buckius [18], who called it "absorption suppression," and by Farmer and Howell [19], who named it "pathlength method." Both references also discuss several variations to the method.

If an optically thin medium is externally irradiated, it is the lack of substantial absorption that causes the method to become inefficient. Energy partitioning can also be used to increase the efficiency for such problems, either in the way described in the previous paragraph, or through a variation called "forced collisions" by Walters and Buckius [18]. Wong and Menguc [20] systematically compared the efficiency of different tracing schemes for irradiated slabs and found energy partitioning to be more efficient for large optical thicknesses and for strong scatterers  $(\omega >0.5)$  ; however, they did not investigate near- transparent media, for which energy. partitioning should also improve convergence.

Energy partitioning can result in tremendous computer time savings for optically thick and thin media. However, the method is limited to media with known (or iterated) temperature field (i.e., it cannot be applied to the standard method for radiative equilibrium, where photon bundles are absorbed and reemitted at selected locations).

Smoothing algorithms similar to those presented in Chapter 8 can be also be applied to exchange areas for participating media, as used in the zonal method of Chapter 18 [21,22]. A simple, yet very effective smoothing scheme for energy deposition into volumetric cells has been proposed by Fippel and Nusslin [23], by minimizing local second derivatives. Wu and coworkers [24] developed the perhaps only higher- order Monte Carlo scheme, evaluating local emission via Lagrangian interpolation of varying order, and similarly distributing absorbed energies across adjacent nodal points.

There are many other ways to make a particular Monte Carlo simulation computationally more efficient. For example, Farmer and Howell [25, 26] overcame the standard method's inefficiency in optically thick media by using hybrid approaches, employing the diffusion approximation of Chapter 15 for optically thick volume elements, and a regular Monte Carlo simulation for the rest. A similar hybrid, separating near- opaque wavelengths, for which they used the  $P_{1}$  - method of Chapter 16, was proposed by Feldick and coworkers [27]. The dilemma of optically thick regions can also be addressed by importance sampling: photon bundles emitted in near- opaque regions are given larger weights (and, thus, are chosen less often) [28, 29].

# 21.8 BACKWARD MONTE CARLO

21.8 BACKWARD MONTE CARLOThe Monte Carlo scheme, as presented so far, is a "forward" method, i.e., a photon bundle is emitted and we then follow its progress until it is absorbed or until it leaves the system. The method can easily simulate problems of great complexity and, for the majority of problems where overall knowledge of the radiation field is desired, the method is reasonably efficient. However, if only the radiative intensity hitting a small spot and/or over a small range of solid angles is required, the method can become terribly inefficient. Consider, for example, a small detector (maybe  $1\mathrm{mm}\times 1\mathrm{mm}$  in size) with a small field of view (capturing only photons hitting it from within a small cone of solid angles) monitoring the radiation from a large furnace filled

with an absorbing, emitting, and scattering medium. In a standard Monte Carlo simulation, we would emit many photon bundles within the furnace and would trace the path of each of these photons, even though only the tiniest of fractions will hit the detector. It may take many billion bundles before a statistically meaningful result is achieved—at the same time the intensity field is being calculated everywhere (without need); clearly a very wasteful procedure. Obviously, it would be much more desirable if one could just trace those photon bundles that eventually hit the detector.

This idea of a backward tracing solution, sometimes also called reverse Monte Carlo, has been applied by several investigators [30- 41], all based on the principle of reciprocity described by Case [42]. This principle states that, if  $I_{\lambda 1}$  and  $I_{\lambda 2}$  are two different solutions to the radiative transfer equation for a specific medium,

$$
\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \nabla I_{\lambda j}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = S_{\lambda j}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) - \beta_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r})I_{\lambda j}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) + \frac{\sigma_{s\lambda}(\mathbf{r})}{4\pi}\int_{4\pi}I_{\lambda j}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\Phi_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime},\hat{\mathbf{s}})d\Omega ,\quad j = 1,2, \tag{21.69}
$$

subject to the boundary condition

$$
I_{\lambda j}(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = I_{w\lambda j}(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}),\quad j = 1,2, \tag{21.70}
$$

then these two solutions are related by the following identity:

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\int_{A}\int_{\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} >0}[I_{w\lambda 2}(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{\lambda 1}(\mathbf{r}_w, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}) - I_{w\lambda 1}(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}})I_{\lambda 2}(\mathbf{r}_w, - \hat{\mathbf{s}})](\hat{\mathbf{n}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}})\delta \Omega dA}\\ & {\qquad = \int_{V}\int_{4\pi}[I_{\lambda 2}(\mathbf{r}, - \hat{\mathbf{s}})S_{\lambda 1}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) - I_{\lambda 1}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})S_{\lambda 2}(\mathbf{r}, - \hat{\mathbf{s}})]d\Omega dV,} \end{array} \tag{21.71}
$$

where  $A$  and  $V$  denote integration over enclosure surface area and enclosure volume, respectively, and  $\hat{\mathbf{n}} \cdot \hat{\mathbf{s}} > 0$  indicates that the integration is over the hemisphere on a point on the surface pointing into the medium.

In the backward Monte Carlo scheme, the solution to  $I_{\lambda 1}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})$  [with specified  $S_{\lambda 1}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})$  and  $I_{w\lambda 1}(\mathbf{r}_{\lambda 1},\hat{\mathbf{s}})]$  is found from the solution to a much simpler problem  $I_{\lambda 2}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}})$ . In particular, if we desire the solution to  $I_{\lambda 1}$  at location  $\mathbf{r}_i$  (say, a detector at the wall) into direction  $- \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  (pointing out of the medium into the surface), we choose  $I_{\lambda 2}$  to be the solution to a collimated point source of unit strength located also at  $\mathbf{r}_i$ , but pointing into the opposite direction,  $+\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$ . Mathematically, this can be expressed as

$$
\begin{array}{c}{I_{w\lambda 2}(\mathbf{r}_w,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = 0,}\\ {S_{\lambda 2}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \delta (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_i)\delta (\hat{\mathbf{s}} -\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i),} \end{array} \tag{21.72a}
$$

where the  $\delta$  are Dirac- delta functions for volume and solid angles. If the infinitesimal cross- section of the source, normal to  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$ , is  $dA_i$ , then this results in an  $I_{\lambda 2}$  intensity at  $\mathbf{r}_i$  of

$$
I_{\lambda 2}(\mathbf{r}_i,\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \frac{\delta(\hat{\mathbf{s}} - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)}{dA_i}. \tag{21.73}
$$

As the  $I_{\lambda 2}$  light beam travels through the absorbing and/or scattering medium, it will be attenuated accordingly.

Sticking equations (21.72) into equation (21.71) yields the desired intensity as

FIGURE21-5 Typical ray path in a backward Monte Carlo simulation.

While the  $I_{\lambda 2}$  problem is much simpler to solve than the  $I_{\lambda 1}$  problem, it remains quite difficult if the medium scatters radiation, making a Monte Carlo solution desirable. Therefore, we will approximate  $I_{\lambda 1}$  as the statistical average over  $N$  distinct paths that a photon bundle emitted at  $\mathbf{r}_i$  into direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_i$  traverses, as schematically shown in Fig. 21- 5, or

$$
I_{\lambda 1}(\mathbf{r}_i, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{n = 1}^{N}I_{\lambda 1n}(\mathbf{r}_i, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i), \tag{21.75}
$$

where the solution for each  $I_{\lambda 1n}$  is found for its distinct statistical path (with absorption and scattering occurrences chosen exactly as in the forward Monte Carlo method). Along such a zigzag path of total length  $l$  from  $\mathbf{r}_i$  to  $\mathbf{r}_w$ , consisting of several straight segments pointing along a local direction  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime}), I_{\lambda 2}$  is nonzero only over an infinitesimal volume along the path,  $dV = dA_i l$ , and an infinitesimal solid angle centered around the local direction vector  $- \hat{\mathbf{s}} = \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})$ . At its final destination on the enclosure surface, the beam of cross- section  $dA_i$  illuminates an area of only  $dA = dA_i / \left(- \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r}_w) \cdot \hat{\mathbf{n}}\right)$ , so that equation (21.74) simplifies to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I_{\lambda 1n}(\mathbf{r}_i, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = I_{w1n}(\mathbf{r}_w, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r}_w))\exp \left[-\int_0^l\kappa_\lambda (\mathbf{r}^{\prime})dl^{\prime}\right]}\\ {+\int_0^l\hat{S}_{\lambda 1}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime}, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime}))\exp \left[-\int_0^{l^{\prime}}\kappa_\lambda (\mathbf{r}^{\prime \prime})dl^{\prime \prime}\right]dl^{\prime \prime},} \end{array} \tag{21.76}
$$

where  $\int_0^{l'} dl''$  indicates integration along the piecewise straight path, starting at  $\mathbf{r}_i$ . It is seen that  $I_{\lambda 1n}(\mathbf{r}_i, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)$  consists of intensity emitted at the wall into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r}_w^{\prime})$  (i.e., along the path toward  $\mathbf{r}_i$ ), attenuated by absorption along the path, and by emission along the path due to the source  $S_{\lambda 1}$ , in the direction of  $- \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime})$  (also along the path toward  $\mathbf{r}_i$ ), and attenuated by absorption along the path, between the point of emission,  $\mathbf{r}^{\prime}$ , and  $\mathbf{r}_i$ . This result is intuitively obvious since it is the same as equation (10.28), except that we here have a zigzag path due to scattering and/or wall reflection events.

If we trace a photon bundle back toward its point of emission, allowing for intermediate reflections from the enclosure wall (as indicated in Fig. 21- 5), then, at the emission point  $\mathbf{r}_w$ ,  $I_{w\lambda 1} = \epsilon_{\lambda} I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r}_w)$ . And, if the internal source of radiation is due to isotropic emission, then,

comparing equations (10.21) and (21.69) we find  $S_{\lambda 1}(\mathbf{r}', - \hat{\mathbf{s}} ') = \kappa_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}')I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r}')$ . Thus,

$$
\begin{array}{l}{I_{\lambda n}(\mathbf{r}_i, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = \epsilon_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}_w)I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r}_w)\exp \left[-\int_0^l\kappa_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}')dl'\right]}\\ {+\int_0^l\kappa_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}')I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r}')\exp \left[-\int_0^{l'}\kappa_{\lambda}(\mathbf{r}'')dl''\right]d'l',} \end{array} \tag{21.77}
$$

where the subscript  $\prime \prime 1^{\prime \prime}$  has been dropped since it is no longer needed. Equation (21.77) may be solved via a standard Monte Carlo simulation or using the energy partitioning scheme of the previous section. For the standard method scattering lengths  $l_{\sigma}$  are chosen from equation (21.21) as well as an absorption length  $l_{\kappa}$  from equation (21.19). The bundle is then traced backward from  $\mathbf{r}_i$  unattenuated [i.e., the exponential decay terms in equation (21.77) are dropped], until the total path length equals  $l_{\kappa}$  or until emission location  $\mathbf{r}_w$  is reached (whichever comes first). Thus,

$$
I_{\lambda n}(\mathbf{r}_i, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}\int_0^{l_k}\kappa_\lambda (\mathbf{r}')I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r}')dl', & l_\kappa < l,\\ \epsilon_\lambda (\mathbf{r}_w)I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r}_w) + \int_0^l\kappa_\lambda (\mathbf{r}')I_{b\lambda}(\mathbf{r}')dl', & l_\kappa \geq l. \end{array} \right. \tag{21.78}
$$

If energy partitioning is used only scattering lengths are chosen from equation (21.21) and  $I_{\lambda n}$  is found directly from equation (21.77).

Radiative Fluxes If radiative flux onto a surface at location  $\mathbf{r}_i$  over a finite range of solid angles is desired, the absorbed incoming flux needs to be computed as in equation (3.17), using the statistical data obtained for  $I_{\lambda n}(\mathbf{r}_i, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i)$ . This is best done by the method described in Section 8.2, equation (8.10). For example, for a detector located at  $\mathbf{r}_i$  with opening angle  $\theta_{\mathrm{max}}$  one obtains

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {q_{\mathrm{det}} = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\theta_{\mathrm{max}}}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\theta ,\psi)I_{\lambda}(\pi -\theta ,\psi)\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta d\psi}\\ & {\quad = \frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{\cos^{2}\theta_{\mathrm{max}}}^{1}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\theta ,\psi)I_{\lambda}(\pi -\theta ,\psi)d(\cos^{2}\theta)d\psi}\\ & {\quad \simeq \pi (1 - \cos^{2}\theta_{\mathrm{max}})\sum_{n = 1}^{N}\epsilon_{\lambda}^{\prime}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{in})I_{\lambda n}(-\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{in}),} \end{array} \tag{21.79}
$$

where the directions  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{in}$  need to be picked uniformly from the interval  $0\leq \psi \leq 2\pi$ ,  $\cos^2\theta_{\mathrm{max}}\leq \cos^2\theta \leq 1$ . The azimuthal angle  $\psi_{n}$  is found from equation (8.41), while  $\theta_{n}$  is found from

$$
R_{\theta} = \frac{\int_{\cos^{2}\theta_{n}}^{1}d\zeta}{\int_{\cos^{2}\theta_{\mathrm{max}}}^{1}d\zeta} = \frac{1 - \cos^{2}\theta_{n}}{1 - \cos^{2}\theta_{\mathrm{max}}} = \frac{\sin^{2}\theta_{n}}{\sin^{2}\theta_{\mathrm{max}}},\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \theta_{n} = \sin^{-1}\left(\sqrt{R_{\theta}}\sin \theta_{\mathrm{max}}\right). \tag{21.80}
$$

If the detector is of finite dimension, points distributed across the surface are chosen like in a forward Monte Carlo simulation.

Collimated Irradiation Backward Monte Carlo is extremely efficient if radiative fluxes onto a small surface and/or over a small solid angle range are needed. Conversely, forward Monte Carlo is most efficient if the radiation source is confined to a small volume and/or solid angle range. Both methods become extremely inefficient, or fail, if radiation from a small source intercepted by a small detector is needed. For collimated irradiation (and similar problems) backward Monte Carlo can be made efficient by separating intensity into a direct (collimated) and a scattered part, as outlined in Chapter 19. Thus, comparing equations (21.69) and (19.12) we find, assuming volumetric emission to be negligible,

$$
S_{\lambda 1}(\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}) = \sigma_{\mathrm{s}}(\mathbf{r})\frac{q_{\mathrm{coll}}(\mathbf{r}_w)}{4\pi}\exp \left[-\int_{0}^{l_c}(\kappa_{\lambda} + \sigma_{s\lambda})dl_c'\right]\Phi (\mathbf{r},\hat{\mathbf{s}}_0,\hat{\mathbf{s}}), \tag{21.81}
$$

where  $q_{\mathrm{coll}}$  is the collimated flux entering the medium at  $\mathbf{r}_{w}$ , traveling a distance of  $l_{c}$  toward  $\mathbf{r}$  in the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{0}$ , and  $\Phi (\mathbf{r}, \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{0}, \hat{\mathbf{s}})$  indicates the amount of collimated flux arriving at  $\mathbf{r}$  from  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_{0}$ , being scattered into the direction of  $\hat{\mathbf{s}}$ . Therefore, the diffuse component of the intensity at  $\mathbf{r}_{i}$  is found immediately from equation (21.76) as

$$
I_{\lambda n}(r_{i}, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i}) = \int_{0}^{l}S_{\lambda 1}(\mathbf{r}^{\prime}, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}^{\prime})\exp \left[-\int_{0}^{l^{\prime}}\kappa_{\lambda}dl^{\prime \prime}\right]d\hat{\mathbf{r}}, \tag{21.82}
$$

with  $S_{\lambda 1}$  from equation (21.81). As before, equation (21.82) may be solved using standard tracing [picking absorption length  $l_{\kappa}$ , and dropping the exponential attenuation term in equation (21.82)] or energy partitioning [using equation (21.82) as given].

# 21.9 DIRECT EXCHANGE MONTE CARLO

As noted in Section 21.7, standard Monte Carlo implementations become inefficient in optically thick media, but that can be mitigated by using the energy partitioning approach. Another difficulty arises in near- isothermal enclosures: while emission from and absorption by a hot cell can be substantial, the net heat transfer between two cells may be very small, i.e., emission is nearly balanced by absorption of incoming radiation. Thus, a small percentage of uncertainty in emitted and absorbed energies may lead to huge uncertainty in the radiative source  $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}$ , the difference between emission and absorption. In the Direct Exchange Monte Carlo scheme the energy exchange between any two cells is formulated in terms of volume integrals (and also a spectral integral if the medium is nongray). Rather than tracing statistically meaningful photon bundles, these exchange integrals are solved stochastically, using the methods of Section 8.2.

For example, the net energy exchange between two homogeneous cells  $V_{i}$  and  $V_{j}$ , in the absence of scattering and wall reflections, is, from Section 18.3

$$
Q_{i\rightarrow j} = -Q_{j\rightarrow i} = \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(I_{b\lambda ,i} - I_{b\lambda ,j}\right)\int_{V_{i}}\int_{V_{j}}e^{-\int \kappa_{\lambda}dS}\frac{\kappa_{\lambda,i}\kappa_{\lambda,j}}{S^{2}} dV_{j}dV_{i}d\lambda , \tag{21.83}
$$

where  $S$  is the distance between any two points within  $V_{i}$  and  $V_{j}$ , and  $\int \kappa_{\lambda} dS$  is the absorption coefficient integrated over that path. Assigning probability density functions for points within  $V_{i}$  and  $V_{j}$  (such as  $p_{i} = 1 / V_{i}$  for uniform probability) and for wavelength, equation (21.83) can be solved stochastically using equation (8.13). This method was first introduced by Cherkaoui et al. for a one- dimensional slab of a nonscattering medium contained between black [43] and reflecting [44] plates. They noted that CPU requirements for an isothermal slab were orders of magnitude lower than for standard Monte Carlo. Tessé [45,46] and coworkers have conceptually extended the method to nonscattering media in three- dimensional enclosures, but only 1D results were reported. A 2D axisymmetric solution for a sooty flame (i.e., without surface reflections) was also reported [47].

# 21.10 EXAMPLE PROBLEMS

We will conclude this chapter on Monte Carlo methods with a couple of worked example problems designed to show the structure of a typical Monte Carlo code, and to highlight the salient features, as well as strengths and weaknesses, of different approaches. All problems deal with energy reaching a (relatively) small detector, in order to investigate the conditions under which backward Monte Carlo can potentially outperform forward Monte Carlo. Problems, in which radiative flux or source is to be determined everywhere, have the same structure, but backward Monte Carlo can, at best, perform equally well as the standard forward approach. The Fortran90 computer codes for all these examples have been included in Appendix F.

FIGURE 21-6 Geometry for Example 21.3.

Example 21.3. Consider a one- dimensional slab  $0 \leq z \leq L = 1 \mathrm{~m}$  of a gray, purely isotropically scattering medium  $(\sigma_{s} = 1 \mathrm{~m}^{- 1} = \mathrm{const})$ , bounded at the top  $(z = 0)$  by vacuum and at the bottom  $(z = L)$  by a cold, black surface. Collimated irradiation of strength  $Q = 100 \mathrm{~W}$  is normally incident on this nonreflecting layer, equally distributed over the disk  $0 \leq r \leq R = 0.1 \mathrm{~m}$ , as shown in Fig. 21- 6. A small detector  $2 \mathrm{~cm} \times 2 \mathrm{~cm}$  in size, with an acceptance angle of  $\theta_{\mathrm{max}}$  is located on the black surface at  $x = x_{0} = 0.2 \mathrm{~m}$ ,  $y = 0$ . Determine the flux incident on the detector for varying acceptance angles, comparing forward and backward Monte Carlo implementations.

# Solution

Forward Monte Carlo Emission points across the irradiation disk for  $N$  bundles are chosen as in Example 8.1,

$$
r = R\sqrt{R_r},\phi = 2\pi R_\phi ,\mathrm{and}x = r\cos \phi ,y = r\sin \phi .
$$

Emission is always into the  $\hat{\mathbf{s}} = \hat{\mathbf{k}}$  or  $\mathcal{Z}$  - direction. Each bundle carries an amount of energy of  $Q / N$  and travels a distance of

$$
l_{\sigma} = \frac{1}{\sigma_{s}}\ln \frac{1}{R_{\sigma}},
$$

from equation (21.20), before being scattered into a new direction found from equations (21.25). For isotropic scattering the incident direction is irrelevant and one may set the new direction to that given for isotropic emission, equations (21.13). The bundle is then traced along as many scattering paths as needed, until it leaves the layer  $(z< 0,$  or  $z > L$  .If the bundle strikes the bottom surface  $(z = L)$  incidence angle  $(\hat{\mathbf{s}}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{k}} >\cos \theta_{\mathrm{max}}2)$  and location  $(x,y$  on detector?) are checked and a detector hit is recorded, if appropriate. Results are shown in Fig. 21- 7. As the detector's acceptance angle increases, more photon bundles are captured. Obviously, this results in a larger detector- absorbed flux. However, it also increases the fraction of statistically meaningful samples, decreasing the variance of the results or the number of required photon bundles to achieve a given variance. All calculations were carried out until the variance fell below  $2\%$  of the calculated flux, and the necessary number of bundles is also included in the figure. For the chosen variance about  $4\times 10^{6}$  bundles are required for large acceptance angles, rising to  $512\times 10^{6}$  for  $\theta_{\mathrm{max}} = 10^{\circ}$  . Results are difficult to obtain for  $\theta_{\mathrm{max}}< 10^{\circ}$  . Similar remarks can be made for detector area: as the detector area decreases, the necessary number of bundles increases. Modeling a more typical detector  $1\mathrm{mm}\times 1\mathrm{mm}$  in size would almost be impossible.

Backward Monte Carlo In this case no direct radiation hits the detector  $(\sigma_{i} > R)$ , and the scattered irradiation is calculated from equations (21.82) and (21.81) with  $q_{\mathrm{coll}} = Q / \pi R^{2}$  as

$$
I_{n}(\mathbf{r}_{i}, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i}) = \int_{0}^{l}\frac{\sigma_{s}Q}{4\pi^{2}R^{2}} e^{-\sigma_{s}z}H\big(R - r(l^{\prime})\big)dl^{\prime},
$$

where  $l$  consists of a number of straight- line segments, for which  $d l^{\prime} = d z^{\prime} / \cos \theta$ , and  $H$  is Heaviside's unit step function. Therefore,

$$
I_{n}(\mathbf{r}_{i}, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i}) = \frac{\sigma_{s}Q}{4\pi^{2}R^{2}}\sum_{j}\int_{z_{1j}}^{z_{2j}}e^{-\sigma_{z}z}\frac{dz}{s_{zj}} = \frac{Q}{4\pi^{2}R^{2}}\sum_{j}\frac{e^{-\sigma_{s}z_{1j}} - e^{\sigma_{s}z_{2j}}}{s_{zj}}, \tag{21.84}
$$

where  $s_{zj} = \cos \theta_j$  is the  $z$ - component of the direction vector for the  $j$ th segment, and  $z_{1j}$  and  $z_{2j}$  are the  $z$ - locations between which the segment lies within the cylindrical column  $r \leq R$  (note that some segments may lie totally inside this column, some partially, and some not at all).

FIGURE 21-7Detector fluxes and required number of photon bundles for Example 21.3.

As in forward Monte Carlo a starting point on the detector is chosen from equation (8.32), and a direction for the backward trace is picked from equations (21.80) and (8.41). Again, a scattering distance is found from equation (21.20), after which the bundle is scattered into a new direction found from equations (21.25). However, rather than having fixed energy, the backward- traveling bundles accumulate energy according to equation (21.84) as they travel through regions with a radiative source. The total flux hitting the detector is calculated by adding up bundle energies according to equation (21.79). Results are included in Fig. 21- 7, and are seen to coincide with forward Monte Carlo results to about one variance or better (discrepancy being larger at large  $\theta_{\mathrm{max}}$ , since the absolute variance increases). However, the number of required bundles remains essentially independent of opening angle at about 20,000 (and, similarly independent of detector area). Since the tracing of a photon bundle requires essentially the same CPU time for forward and backward tracing, for the problem given here the backward Monte Carlo scheme is up to 25,000 times more efficient than forward Monte Carlo.

Fortran90 codes used for this example are included in Appendix F as RevMccs and FwdMccs.

Example 21.4. Repeat the previous example, for an acceptance angle of  $\theta_{\mathrm{max}} = 10^{\circ}$ , assuming that the medium absorbs as well as scatters radiation, using absorption coefficients of  $\kappa_{\lambda} = 1\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$  and  $\kappa_{\lambda} = 5\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$ . Use forward as well as backward Monte Carlo, and also both standard ray tracing as well as energy partitioning.

# Solution

Forward Monte Carlo- standard ray tracing The solution proceeds as in the previous example, except that also an absorption length  $l_{k}$  is chosen, from equation (21.17). If the sum of all scattering paths exceeds  $l_{\kappa}$ , the bundle is terminated.

Forward Monte Carlo- energy partitioning The solution proceeds as in the previous example, except the energy of each bundle hitting the detector is attenuated by a factor of  $\exp (- \kappa l)$ , where  $l$  is the total (scattered) path that the bundle travels through the layer before hitting the detector.

Backward Monte Carlo- standard ray tracing The solution proceeds as in the previous example, except for two changes. First, the local scattering source must be attenuated by absorption of the direct beam, and equation (21.84) becomes

$$
I_{n}(\mathbf{r}_{l}, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{l}) = \frac{\sigma_{s}Q}{4\pi^{2}R^{2}}\sum_{j}\int_{z_{1j}}^{z_{2j}}e^{-(\kappa +\sigma_{s})z}\frac{dz}{s_{zj}} = \frac{\omega Q}{4\pi^{2}R^{2}}\sum_{j}\frac{e^{-\beta z_{2j}} - e^{-\beta z_{2j}}}{s_{zj}}, \tag{21.85}
$$

where  $\omega$  and  $\beta$  are scattering albedo and extinction coefficient, as usual. And again, an absorption length  $l_{\kappa}$  is chosen, and the addition in equation (21.85) is stopped as soon as the total path reaches  $l_{\kappa}$  or the bundle leaves the layer (whichever comes first).

\*Variance of  $5\%$  (all other data have variance of  $2\%$

Backward Monte Carlo- energy partitioning Again, the scattering source must be attenuated as in equation (21.85), but the exponential attenuation term in equation (21.82) must also be retained. Thus,

$$
I_{n}(\mathbf{r}_{i}, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_{i}) = \frac{\sigma_{s}Q}{4\pi^{2}R^{2}}\int_{0}^{l}e^{-\beta z(l^{\prime}) - \kappa l^{\prime}}H\big(R - r(l^{\prime})\big)dl^{\prime},
$$

where the integrand contributes only where the source is active  $(r\leq R)$  , but attenuation of the bundle takes place everywhere  $(l^{\prime} =$  total distance along path from  $\mathbf{r}_i$  to  $\mathbf{r}^{\prime}$  ). With  $l^{\prime} = l_{1j} + (z - z_{1j}) / s_{zj},dl^{\prime} = dz / s_{zj},$  and  $l_{2j} = l_{1j} + (z_{2j} - z_{1j}) / s_{zj},$  where  $l_{1j}$  and  $l_{2j}$  are total path lengths of the bundle until the beginning and end of segment  $j,$  respectively, this becomes

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}I_n(\mathbf{r}_i, - \hat{\mathbf{s}}_i) & = & \frac{\sigma_sQ}{4\pi^2R^2}\sum_j e^{-\kappa l_{1j}}\int_{z_{1j}}^{z_{2j}}e^{-\beta z - \kappa (z - z_{1j}) / s_{zj}}\frac{dz}{s_{zj}}\\ & = & \frac{\sigma_sQ}{4\pi^2R^2}\sum_j e^{-\kappa l_{1j}}\frac{e^{-\beta z_{1j}} - e^{-\beta z_{2j} - \kappa (z_{2j} - z_{1j}) / s_{zj}}}{\beta + \kappa / s_{zj}}\\ & = & \frac{Q}{4\pi^2R^2}\sum_j\frac{\sigma_s}{\beta + \kappa / s_{zj}}\left[e^{-\beta z_{1j} - \kappa l_{1j}} - e^{-\beta z_{2j} - \kappa l_{2j}}\right]. \end{array}
$$

The rest of the simulation remains as in the previous example. Results are summarized in Table 21.1. As expected, if standard ray tracing is employed, the number of required bundles grows astronomically if the absorption coefficient becomes large, both for forward and backward Monte Carlo. While backward Monte Carlo retains its advantage (indeed, the forward Monte Carlo simulation for  $\kappa_{\lambda} = 5\mathrm{m}^{- 1}$  could only be carried out to a variance of  $5\%$  ), the relative growth of required bundles appears to be worse for backward Monte Carlo. If energy partitioning is employed, the number of bundles remains unaffected by the absorption coefficient for both, forward and backward Monte Carlo. All four Fortran90 codes used for this example have also been included in Appendix F.

It was demonstrated in the last two examples that in media with large optical thickness based on absorption coefficient, energy partitioning is vastly more efficient than the standard method. And in problems to find irradiation onto small surfaces and/or small solid angles, backward Monte Carlo strongly outperforms forward Monte Carlo. As seen in the last example, employing backward Monte Carlo with energy partitioning may reduce CPU time by a factor of 1,000,000 or more!

# Problems

Because of the nature of the Monte Carlo technique, most of the following problems require the development of a small computer code. However, all problem solutions can be outlined by giving relevant relations, equations, and a detailed flow chart.

21.1 Consider the (highly artificial) absorption coefficient of Problem 11.22. Find narrow band averages for the absorption coefficient and the transmissivity using Monte Carlo integration (use mcint. f90 or write your own code). Compare with answers from Problem 11.22.

21.2 Consider radiative equilibrium in a plane- parallel medium between two isothermal, diffusely emitting and reflecting gray plates ( $T_{1} = 300\mathrm{K}$ ,  $\epsilon_{1} = 0.5$ ,  $T_{2} = 2000\mathrm{K}$ ,  $\epsilon_{2} = 0.8$ ) spaced  $L = 1\mathrm{m}$  apart. The medium has constant absorption and scattering coefficients ( $\kappa = 0.01\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ,  $\sigma_{\mathrm{s}} = 0.04\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ ), and scattering is linear- anisotropic with  $A_{1} = 0.5$ . Calculate the radiative heat flux and the temperature distribution within the medium by the Monte Carlo method. Compare with results from the  $P_{1}$ - approximation.

21.3 Consider an isothermal plane- parallel slab ( $T = 1000\mathrm{K}$ ) between two cold, gray, diffuse surfaces ( $\epsilon = 0.5$ ). The medium absorbs and emits but does not scatter. Prepare a standard Monte Carlo solution to obtain the radiative heat loss from the medium for optical thickness  $\kappa L = 0.2$ , 1, 5, 10. Compare with the exact solution.

21.4 Repeat Problem 21.3 using energy partitioning. Compare the efficiency of the two methods.

21.5 A molecular gas is confined between two parallel, black plates, spaced  $1\mathrm{m}$  apart, that are kept isothermal at  $T_{1} = 1200\mathrm{K}$  and  $T_{2} = 800\mathrm{K},$  respectively. The (hypothetical) gas has a single vibrationrotation band in the infrared, with an average absorption coefficient of

$$
\bar{\kappa}_{g\eta} = \left(\frac{S}{d}\right)_{\eta} = \frac{\alpha}{\omega} e^{-2|\eta -\eta_0| / \omega},\quad \eta_0 = 3000\mathrm{cm}^{-1},\quad \omega = 200\mathrm{cm}^{-1}
$$

and a line overlap parameter of  $\beta$  (see the discussion of narrow band and wide band models in Chapter 11). Assuming convection and conduction to be negligible, determine the radiative heat flux between the two plates, using the Monte Carlo method. Carry out the analysis for variable values of  $(\alpha /\omega)$  and  $\beta ,$  and plot nondimensional radiative heat flux vs.  $(S / d)_0L$  with  $\beta$  as a parameter.

21.6 Consider a sphere of very hot molecular gas of radius  $50\mathrm{cm}$  .The gas has a single vibrationrotation band at  $\eta_0 = 3000\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  , is suspended magnetically in a vacuum within a large, cold con- . tainer, and is initially at a uniform temperature  $T_{g} = 3000\mathrm{K}$  . For this gas,  $\rho_{a}\alpha (T) = 500\mathrm{cm}^{- 2}$ $\omega =$ $100\sqrt{T / 100\mathrm{Kcm}^{- 1}}$ $\beta \gg 1$  . This implies that the absorption coefficient may be determined from

$$
\kappa_{\eta} = \kappa_{0}e^{-2|\eta -\eta_{0}| / \omega},\quad \kappa_{0} = \frac{\rho_{a}\alpha}{\omega}
$$

and the band absorptance from

$$
A(s) = \omega A^{*} = \omega [E_{1}(\kappa_{0}s) + \ln (\kappa_{0}s) + \gamma_{E}].
$$

Find the total heat loss from the sphere and its temperature distribution by the Monte Carlo method (including  $t > 0$  -

21.7 Consider a sphere of very hot dissociated gas of radius  $5\mathrm{cm}$  . The gas may be approximated as a gray, isotropically scattering medium with  $\kappa = 0.1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ $\alpha_{\mathrm{r}} = 0.2\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  . The gas is suspended magnetically in a vacuum within a large, cold container and is initially at a uniform temperature  $T_{g} = 10,000\mathrm{K}$  Using the Monte Carlo method and neglecting conduction and convection, specify the total heat loss per unit time from the entire sphere at  $t = 0$  . Outline the solution for times  $t > 0$

21.8 Consider an absorbing- scattering slab irradiated by a short- pulsed laser, as described in Example 19.3. Prepare a transient Monte Carlo code to predict the flux exiting the slab as a function of time into either direction (transmissivity and reflectivity).

# RADIATION COMBINED WITH CONDUCTION AND CONVECTION

# 22.1 INTRODUCTION

In our analyses of radiative transfer in participating media we have, up to this point, always assumed that there was no interaction with other modes of heat transfer, i.e., we have limited ourselves to cases of radiative equilibrium and cases of specified temperature fields. In practical systems, of course, it is nearly always the case that radiation occurs in conjunction with conduction and/or convection, and two or three heat transfer modes must be accounted for simultaneously. In such cases overall conservation of energy, equation (10.72), needs to be solved, which always leads to a nonlinear integro- differential equation.

Many important applications of interactions between radiation and other modes of heat transfer have been reported in the literature. Discussion of all of these could easily, by itself, fill a book as voluminous as this one. We will therefore limit ourselves here to the discussion of a few very basic cases  $(i)$  to show the basic trends of how the different modes of heat transfer interact with one another, and  $(ii)$  to outline some of the numerical schemes that have been used to solve such problems. We will begin with two sections that deal with combined radiation and conduction in participating media, the latter one including change- of- phase effects. Combined radiation and convection is treated in several subsequent sections, the first three dealing with simple external and internal flows, as well as natural convection. Separate sections have been devoted to more advanced topics, such as radiation in chemically reacting flows, numerical interfacing between convection, chemical reactions and radiation, and turbulence- radiation interactions.

For much of this chapter we will limit our theoretical developments to a simple plane- parallel geometry with a gray medium, since our aim is to investigate only the general trends of the interaction among the different modes of heat transfer. More advanced topics and applications, such as the multidimensional interaction of radiation with convection, turbulence, and chemical reactions will be outlined in order to understand the nature of such interactions, and a list of references for more in- depth study will be given.

# 22.2 COMBINED RADIATION AND CONDUCTION

Throughout the remainder of this chapter we will deal with the interaction of radiation with conduction and/or convection within an absorbing, emitting, and scattering medium. We start

in this section by discussing the interaction between radiation and conduction in a stationary, radiatively participating medium. Since we are primarily interested in general trends and in evaluation methods, we will limit ourselves here to the relatively simple example of steady- state heat transfer through a one- dimensional, absorbing- emitting (but not scattering) gray medium, confined between two parallel, isothermal, gray, diffusely emitting and reflecting plates.

The energy equation for simultaneous conduction and radiation in a participating medium is, from equation (10.72),

$$
\rho \mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{r}}\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \nabla \cdot (k\nabla T) + \dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime} - \nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}_{\mathrm{r}}. \tag{22.1}
$$

For a one- dimensional, planar medium at steady state and without internal heat generation, this reduces to equation (10.73), or

$$
\frac{d}{dz}\left(k\frac{dT}{dz} -q_R\right) = 0, \tag{22.2}
$$

subject to the boundary conditions

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{z=0:}&{T(0)=T_1,}\\{z=L:}&{T(L)=T_2.}\end{array} \tag{22.3b}
$$

The radiative heat flux, or its divergence

$$
\frac{dq_k}{dz} = \int_0^\infty \kappa_\eta (4\pi I_{b\eta} - G_\eta)d\eta , \tag{22.4}
$$

may be obtained by any of the methods discussed in the preceding chapters.

For simplicity, we will assume that all properties are constant (i.e., thermal conductivity  $k,$  absorption coefficient  $\kappa_{j}$  and refractive index  $n$  ) and gray. Note that the assumption of a semitransparent medium implies that the absorptive index (also denoted by the letter  $k$  )- although directly related to the absorption coefficient- is negligible' in the evaluation of the blackbody intensity, i.e.,  $I_{b} = n^{2}\sigma T^{4} / \pi$  . Introducing the nondimensional variables and parameters

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\xi = \frac{z}{L},\quad \theta = \frac{T}{T_1},\quad \Psi_R = \frac{q_R}{n^2\sigma T_1^4},\quad g = \frac{G}{4n^2\sigma T_1^4};}\\ {\tau_L = \kappa L,\quad \theta_L = \frac{T_2}{T_1},\quad N = \frac{k\kappa}{4\sigma T_1^3},} \end{array}
$$

reduces equations (22.2) through (22.4) to

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} = \frac{1}{4N}\frac{d\Psi_R}{dt},\\ \displaystyle \frac{d\Psi_R}{d\tau} = 4(\theta^4 -g),\\ \displaystyle \theta (0) = 1,\quad \theta (\tau_L) = \theta_L. \end{array} \tag{22.5}
$$

Here  $\tau_{L}$  is the optical thickness of the medium, and  $N$  is known as the conduction- to- radiation parameter. For optically thick slabs  $(\tau_{L}\gg 1)N$  gives a good estimate of the relative importance of conductive and radiative heat fluxes: From equations (15.17) and (15.18),

$$
\tau_{L} > 1:\frac{q_{C}}{q_{R}} = \frac{-k\partial T / \partial z}{-k_{R}\partial T / \partial z} = \frac{k}{k_{R}} = \frac{3}{4}\frac{k\kappa}{4n^{2}\sigma T^{4}},
$$

which gives the ratio of heat fluxes in terms of a local temperature. The situation is a little more complicated for optically thin situations  $(\tau_{L}\ll 1)$ , for which the temperature field of the entire enclosure must be considered. For example, for an optically thin slab bounded by two black walls at  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2}$ , respectively, from equation (15.7),

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\tau_{L}\ll 1:\quad q_{R}\simeq n^{2}\sigma (T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4}) = 4n^{2}\sigma T_{\mathrm{av}}^{3}(T_{1} - T_{2}),}\\ & {\quad q_{c} = -k\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}\simeq k(T_{1} - T_{2}) / L,}\\ & {\quad q_{c} = \frac{k / L}{4n^{2}\sigma T_{\mathrm{av}}^{3}} = \frac{1}{\tau_{L}}\frac{k\kappa}{4n^{2}\sigma T_{\mathrm{av}}^{3}}.} \end{array}
$$

If, in an optically thin slab, emission from within the slab (rather than from its boundaries) dominates the radiative heat flux, then  $q_{R}$  becomes proportional to  $\kappa$  [cf. equation (10.54)], and

$$
\tau_{L}\ll 1(\mathrm{emission~dominated}):\frac{q_{C}}{q_{R}} = \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{N}{\tau_{L}^{2}}\right).
$$

As representative examples for combined radiation and conduction in a slab, we will discuss here solutions for the radiative heat flux using the exact integral formulation (as presented in Chapter 14) and the differential or  $P_{1}$ - approximation (described in Sections 15.4 and 16.5). Similarly, equation (22.2) may be solved by a variety of numerical techniques. Since the equation is nonlinear (because of the  $T^{4}$ - dependence for the radiative heat flux), analytical solutions are not possible, and numerical schemes require an iterative solution. For illustrative purposes we will limit ourselves here to a finite- difference solution of equations (22.2) and (22.3).

# Exact Formulation

The exact formulation for incident radiation  $G$  and radiative heat flux  $q_{R}$  for a one- dimensional slab with specified temperature distribution has been given by equations (14.53) and (14.54). For a nonscattering medium the radiative source term reduces to  $S(\tau) = I_{b}(\tau) = n^{2}\sigma T^{4}(\tau) / \pi$  [as given by equation (14.52)], and the radiative heat flux, as given by equation (14.54), becomes, in nondimensional form,

$$
\Psi_{R}(\tau) = 2\left\{\mathcal{J}_{1}E_{3}(\tau) - \mathcal{J}_{2}E_{3}(\tau_{L} - \tau) + \int_{0}^{\tau}\theta^{4}(\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau -\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime} - \int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}\theta^{4}(\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau^{\prime} - \tau)d\tau^{\prime}\right\} , \tag{22.8}
$$

where we have introduced the nondimensional radiosities  $\mathcal{J}_{i} = J_{i} / a^{2}\sigma T_{1}^{4}$ . Equation (22.8) may be integrated by parts, using the recursion relations of Appendix E, leading to

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\Psi_{R}(\tau) = 2\Big\{(\mathcal{J}_{1} - 1)E_{3}(\tau) - (\mathcal{J}_{2} - \theta_{L}^{4})E_{3}(\tau_{L} - \tau)}\\ {-\int_{0}^{\tau}\frac{d\theta^{4}}{d\tau^{\prime}} (\tau^{\prime})E_{3}(\tau -\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime} - \int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}\frac{d\theta^{4}}{d\tau^{\prime}} (\tau^{\prime})E_{3}(\tau^{\prime} - \tau)d\tau^{\prime}\Big\} ,} \end{array} \tag{22.9}
$$

and, using Leibniz's rule [1], as given by equation (3.107),

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\frac{d\Psi_R}{d\tau} = 2\Big\{(1 - \mathcal{J}_1)E_2(\tau) + (\theta_L^4 -\mathcal{J}_2)E_2(\tau_L - \tau)}\\ {+\int_0^\tau \frac{d\theta^4}{d\tau'} (\tau ')E_2(\tau -\tau ')d\tau ' - \int_\tau^{\tau_L}\frac{d\theta^4}{d\tau'} (\tau ')E_2(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau '\Big\} .} \end{array} \tag{22.10}
$$

Equation (22.10) must be solved simultaneously with equation (22.5) and its boundary conditions (22.7). For nonblack surfaces two additional relations are required for the determination

of the radiosities  $\mathcal{J}_1$  and  $\mathcal{J}_2$ . These may be obtained by applying equation (22.9) (evaluation of the radiative heat flux in terms of radiosities and medium temperature) at the two boundaries, eliminating the radiative heat flux through equation (14.48) (relating heat flux to radiosity and surface temperature). For the illustrative purposes of our present discussion, we will limit ourselves to black surfaces, i.e.,  $\mathcal{J}_1 = 1$  and  $\mathcal{J}_2 = \theta_L^4$ , and

$$
\frac{d\Psi_R}{d\tau} = 2\left\{\int_0^{\tau}d\theta \frac{4}{\tau'} (\tau ')E_2(\tau -\tau ')d\tau ' - \int_\tau^{\tau_L}\frac{d\theta^4}{\tau'} (\tau ')E_2(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau '\right\} . \tag{22.11}
$$

For this simple case, substitution of equation (22.11) into (22.5) gives a single nonlinear integrodifferential equation for the unknown temperature,  $\theta$ . Once the temperature field has been determined, the total heat flux follows as

$$
q = -k\frac{dT}{dz} +q_R = \mathrm{const},
$$

or, in nondimensional form,

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{n^2\sigma T_1^4} = -4N\frac{d\theta}{d\tau} +\Psi_R = \mathrm{const.} \tag{22.12}
$$

Example 22.1. An absorbing- emitting medium is contained between two large, parallel, isothermal, black plates at temperatures  $T_{1}$  and  $T_{2} = 0.5T_{1}$ , respectively. Determine the steady- state temperature distribution within the medium and the total heat flux between the two plates, if heat is transferred by conduction and radiation. Discuss the influence of the conduction- to- radiation parameter,  $N$ , and of the optical thickness of the layer,  $\tau_{i}$ .

# Solution

The numerical solution to the governing equation may be found in a number of ways. We will employ here  $J + 1$  equally spaced nodes  $\tau = 0, \Delta \tau , 2\Delta \tau , \ldots , J\Delta \tau = \tau_{i}$  with nodal temperatures  $\theta_{i} (i = 0,1,2,\ldots ,J)$  and simple finite- differencing for the conduction term,

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{d\tau^2}\simeq \frac{\theta_{i + 1} - 2\theta_i + \theta_{i - 1}}{\Delta\tau^2} +\mathcal{O}(\Delta \tau^2),
$$

with a truncation error of order  $\Delta \tau^2$ . The divergence of the radiative heat flux, equation (22.11), will be calculated by approximating the emissive power,  $\theta^4$ , by a spline function, followed by analytical evaluation of the piecewise integrals. In order to obtain the same truncation error as for the conduction term,  $\mathcal{O}(\Delta \tau^2)$ , the prediction of  $d\theta^4 /d\tau '$  must be accurate to  $\mathcal{O}(\Delta \tau)$  [since the piecewise integration decreases the truncation error by  $\mathcal{O}(\Delta \tau)$ ]. Thus, for the emissive power a linear spline is sufficient, or

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\theta^4 (\tau) = \theta_i^4 +B_i(\tau -\tau_i) + \mathcal{O}(\Delta \tau^2) = \frac{\theta_i^4(\tau_{i + 1} - \tau) + \theta_{i + 1}^4(\tau - \tau_i)}{\Delta\tau} +\mathcal{O}(\Delta \tau^2),}\\ {\frac{d\theta^4}{d\tau} (\tau) = \frac{\theta_{i + 1}^4 - \theta_i^4}{\Delta\tau} +\mathcal{O}(\Delta \tau),}\\ {\tau_i< \tau < \tau_{i + 1},\quad i = 0,1,2,\ldots ,J - 1.} \end{array}
$$

Substituting this into equation (22.11) leads to

$$
\begin{array}{r l r}{{\left(\frac{d\Psi_{R}}{d\tau}\right)_{i}\simeq2\sum_{j=1}^{i}\frac{\theta_{j}^{4}-\theta_{j-1}^{4}}{\Delta\tau}\int_{\tau_{j-1}}^{\tau_{j}}E_{2}(\tau_{i}-\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime}-2\sum_{j=i+1}^{J}\frac{\theta_{j}^{4}-\theta_{j-1}^{4}}{\Delta\tau}\int_{\tau_{j-1}}^{\tau_{j}}E_{2}(\tau^{\prime}-\tau_{i})d\tau^{\prime}}}\\ &{}&{=\frac{2}{\Delta\tau}\sum_{j=1}^{i}\left(\theta_{j}^{4}-\theta_{j-1}^{4}\right)\left[E_{3}(\tau_{i}-\tau_{j})-E_{3}(\tau_{i}-\tau_{j-1})\right]+\frac{2}{\Delta\tau}\sum_{j=i+1}^{J}\left(\theta_{j}^{4}-\theta_{j-1}^{4}\right)\left[E_{3}(\tau_{j}-\tau_{i})-E_{3}(\tau_{j-1}-\tau_{i})\right]}\\ &{}&{=\frac{2}{\Delta\tau}\sum_{j=1}^{J}\left(\theta_{j}^{4}-\theta_{j-1}^{4}\right)\left[E_{3}\left(i j-j|\Delta\tau\right)-E_{3}\left(i j+1-j|\Delta\tau\right)\right].}\end{array}
$$

Equating both sides of equation (22.5), we find

$$
\begin{array}{l}\theta_{i - 1} - 2\theta_{i} + \theta_{i + 1} = \frac{\Delta\tau}{2N}\sum_{j = 1}^{J}(\theta_{j}^{4} - \theta_{j - 1}^{4})\left[E_{3}(|i - j|\Delta \tau) - E_{3}(|i + 1 - j|\Delta \tau)\right],\quad i = 1,2,\ldots ,J - 1,\\ \theta_{0} = 1,\quad \theta_{J} = \theta_{L}. \end{array}
$$

If  $N$  is relatively large  $(N > 0.1)$ , heat transfer is dominated by conduction, and the solution proceeds as follows:

1. A temperature profile is guessed (e.g., the linear profile for pure conduction), and the  $(d\Psi_{R} / d\tau)_{i}$  are calculated based on these temperatures.  
2. A new temperature profile is determined by inverting the simple tridiagonal matrix for  $\theta$ .  
3. The temperature profile is iterated on, using underrelaxation as necessary (as discussed in the previous example).

If  $N$  is small, radiation dominates, and the process should be reversed:

1. A temperature profile is guessed, the conduction contribution is calculated, and an emissive power field is determined by inverting the full matrix for the  $\theta_{i}^{4}$  on the right-hand side.

2. A new temperature profile is deduced from the emissive powers, etc.

Once the temperature profile is known, the total heat flux follows from equations (22.9) and (22.12) as

$$
\begin{array}{r l r} & {} & {\Psi_{i}\simeq -\frac{2N}{\Delta\tau} (\theta_{i + 1} - \theta_{i - 1}) - \frac{2}{\Delta\tau}\left\{\sum_{j = 1}^{i}\left(\theta_{j}^{4} - \theta_{j - 1}^{4}\right)\int_{\tau_{j - 1}}^{\tau_{j}}E_{3}(\tau_{i} - \tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime}\right.}\\ & {} & {\left. + \sum_{j = i + 1}^{J}\left(\theta_{j}^{4} - \theta_{j - 1}^{4}\right)\int_{\tau_{j - 1}}^{\tau_{j}}E_{3}(\tau_{i}^{\prime} - \tau_{i})d\tau^{\prime}\right\}}\\ & {} & {= -\frac{2N}{\Delta\tau}\left(\theta_{i + 1} - \theta_{i - 1}\right) - \frac{2}{\Delta\tau}\left\{\sum_{j = 1}^{i}\left(\theta_{j}^{4} - \theta_{j - 1}^{4}\right)\left[E_{4}(\tau_{i} - \tau_{j}) - E_{4}(\tau_{i} - \tau_{j - 1})\right]\right.}\\ & {} & {\left. - \sum_{j = i + 1}^{J}\left(\theta_{j}^{4} - \theta_{j - 1}^{4}\right)\left[E_{4}(\tau_{j} - \tau_{i}) - E_{4}(\tau_{j - 1} - \tau_{i})\right]\right\} ,\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,J - 1.} \end{array}
$$

This value for the nondimensional heat flux should be the same for all nodes.

Representative results are shown in Figs. 22- 1 and 22- 2. Figure 22- 1 shows the nondimensional temperature variation within the slab for an intermediate optical thickness of  $\tau_{i} = 1$ , calculated by two different methods: by the integral formulation of the present example, and by the  $P_{1}$ - approximation. For  $N = 0$  there is no conduction, and the temperature profile is discontinuous at the walls, as first indicated in Fig. 14- 3. For very small values of  $N$  the temperature profile remains similar except near the walls, where the medium temperature must rapidly approach the surface temperatures. As  $N$  increases, the influence of conduction increases, and the temperature profile rapidly becomes linear. For optically thin situations (not shown) the effect is even more pronounced: larger temperature jumps at the wall for  $N = 0$  and an already near- linear temperature profile for  $N = 0.01$ . This behavior may be explained by noting that—for small  $\tau_{i}$ —little emission and absorption takes place inside the medium; radiative heat flux travels directly from surface to surface.

Representative nondimensional heat fluxes are shown in Fig. 22- 2 and are compared with approximate methods, which will be discussed a little later. Since the optical thickness of a slab acts as a radiative barrier between two surfaces at different temperatures, the net heat flux increases with decreasing  $\tau_{i}$ . That  $q / n^{2}\sigma \tau_{1}^{4}$  increases with increasing  $N$  may be interpreted in two opposite ways: If the increase of  $N$  is due to an increase in thermal conductivity  $k$ , then the conductive and total heat fluxes increase. However, if the increase in  $N$  is due to a decrease in  $T_{1}$ , the radiative and total heat fluxes decrease due to the decreasing temperature levels (since  $q / n^{2}\sigma \tau_{1}^{4}$  increases less rapidly than  $N$ ).

Simple combined conduction- radiation problems such as this were first treated by Viskanta and Grosh [2, 3] and Lick [4]. More recent investigations for nonscattering media have looked

at laser flash diffusivity measurements of semitransparent materials [5], and several nongray problems such as heat transfer through aerogels [6], plastics [7], and combustion gases [8]. Several other one- dimensional investigations have also used exact radiation formulations in the presence of isotropic [9- 11] and even anisotropic scattering [12], all using gray and constant radiation properties. Two- dimensional problems have been considered by Wu and Ou [13], who looked at a gray rectangular medium with isotropic scattering, and by Tuntomo and Tien [14], who applied Maxwell's equations to small metallic particles irradiated by a laser. A comprehensive review of combined conduction- radiation heat transfer investigations has been given by Siegel [15].

# $P_{1}$ -Approximation

The governing equations for the  $P_{1}$ - approximation and their boundary conditions have been given by equations (15.42) through (15.44) for the one- dimensional slab, and by equations (16.50) through (16.52) for general geometries. For a one- dimensional, gray, nonscattering slab between two gray- diffuse surfaces, the relations may be summarized as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{dq}{d\tau} = 4\pi I_b - G,\\ \displaystyle \frac{dG}{d\tau} = -3q, \end{array} \tag{22.14}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\tau = 0:\qquad 2q = 4J_1 - G = \frac{\epsilon_1}{2 - \epsilon_1} (4\pi I_{b1} - G),}\\ {\tau = \tau_L:\qquad -2q = 4J_2 - G = \frac{\epsilon_2}{2 - \epsilon_2} (4\pi I_{b2} - G),} \end{array} \tag{22.15b}
$$

or, in nondimensional form (as given at the beginning of this section),

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{d\Psi_R}{d\tau} = 4(\theta^4 -g),\\ \displaystyle \frac{dg}{d\tau} = -\frac{3}{4}\Psi_R, \end{array} \tag{22.17}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{l}\tau = 0:\qquad \Psi_R = 2(\mathcal{J}_1 - g) = \frac{2\epsilon_1}{2 - \epsilon_1} (1 - g),\\ \displaystyle \tau = \tau_L:\qquad -\Psi_R = 2(\mathcal{J}_2 - g) = \frac{2\epsilon_2}{2 - \epsilon_2} (\theta_L^4 -g). \end{array} \tag{22.18b}
$$

The radiative heat flux,  $\Psi_{R}$ , may be eliminated from equations (22.16) through (22.18), leading to

$$
\frac{d^2g}{d\tau^2} +3(\theta^4 -g) = 0, \tag{22.19}
$$

$$
\begin{array}{ll}\tau = 0: & \frac{dg}{d\tau} +\frac{3}{2}\frac{\epsilon_1}{2 - \epsilon_1} (1 - g) = 0,\\ \displaystyle \tau = \tau_L: & \frac{dg}{d\tau} -\frac{3}{2}\frac{\epsilon_2}{2 - \epsilon_2} (\theta_L^4 -g) = 0. \end{array} \tag{22.20b}
$$

This second- order differential equation for the incident radiation is connected to the overall energy equation by combining equations (22.5) and (22.6), or

$$
\frac{d^2\theta}{d\tau^2} = \frac{1}{N} (\theta^4 -g), \tag{22.21}
$$

with its boundary condition (22.7). A solution is obtained by guessing a temperature field, followed by the determination of the incident radiation field from equations (22.19) and (22.20). This, in turn, is used to find an updated temperature field from equations (22.21) and (22.7). Using suitable underrelaxation (generally necessary because of the nonlinearity of the problem), an iteration is performed until converged temperature and incident radiation fields have been obtained. At that point the net heat flux may be calculated from equation (22.12) after evaluation of the radiative heat flux from equation (22.17), or

$$
\Psi_{R} = -\frac{4}{3}\frac{dg}{d\tau}. \tag{22.22}
$$

FIGURE 22-3  Nodal system for a one-dimensional slab, with artificial nodes  $-1^{\prime \prime}$  and  $^{\prime \prime}J + 1^{\prime \prime}$  inside the walls.

# Solution

We will use a simple finite- difference method for the solution of overall energy as well as the  $P_{1}$  approximation. As before, we will break up the optical thickness  $\tau_{i}$  into  $J + 1$  equally spaced nodes:  $i = 0,1,\ldots ,J$  with  $\tau_{i} = i\Delta \tau$  and  $\Delta \tau = \tau_{i} / N$ . Thus, equation (22.21) becomes

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\theta_{i - 1} - 2\theta_{i} + \theta_{i + 1} = \phi_{i} = \frac{\Delta\tau^{2}}{N} (\theta_{i}^{4} - g_{i}),\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,J - 1,}\\ {\theta_{0} = 1,\quad \theta_{J} = \theta_{L}.} \end{array}
$$

Similarly, equation (22.19) transforms to

$$
g_{i - 1} - (2 + 3\Delta \tau^{2})g_{i} + g_{i + 1} = -3\Delta \tau^{2}\theta_{i}^{4},\qquad i = 1,2,\ldots ,J - 1.
$$

Two more relations are needed at the two walls. The two boundary conditions for  $g$  are of the third kind, i.e., they contain both the dependent variable and its normal derivative. In order to retain the overall truncation error of  $\mathcal{O}(\Delta \tau^{2})$  for all relations, and to retain the tridiagonal nature of the finite- difference equations, it is best to use the method of artificial nodes [16]. In this method hypothetical nodes outside the medium (i.e., inside the walls) are introduced on each side, as indicated in the sketch of Fig. 22- 3, and equations (22.19) and (22.20) are finite- differenced at the walls as if the boundary nodes were well inside the medium. Thus, with

$$
\left(\frac{dg}{d\tau}\right)_0\cong \frac{g_1 - g_{-1}}{2\Delta\tau},
$$

we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}{g_{-1} - (2 + 3\Delta \tau^2)g_0 + g_1} & = & {-3\Delta \tau^2,}\\ {} & {} & {}\\ {-g_{-1}} & {} & {-3\Delta \tau g_0 + g_1 = -3\Delta \tau .} \end{array}
$$

Adding,

$$
-[2 + 3\Delta \tau (1 + \Delta \tau)]g_0 + 2g_1 = -3\Delta \tau (1 + \Delta \tau).
$$

Similarly, at the other boundary,

$$
\begin{array}{rcl}{g_{N - 1} - (2 + 3\Delta \tau^2)g_N + g_{N + 1}} & = & {-3\Delta \tau^2\theta_L^4,}\\ {} & {} & {}\\ {-g_{N - 1}} & {} & {+3\Delta \tau g_N + g_{N + 1}} & {= 3\Delta \tau \theta_L^4,} \end{array}
$$

and, after subtracting,

$$
2g_{N - 1} - [2 + 3\Delta \tau (1 + \Delta \tau)]g_N = -3\Delta \tau (1 + \Delta \tau)\theta_L^4.
$$

Therefore, we have two simultaneous tridiagonal systems for the unknown  $\theta_{i}$  and  $g_{i}$ . These systems are readily solved by guessing a distribution for the  $\phi_{i}$  (say,  $\phi_{i} = 0$ ) and inverting the tridiagonal matrix for  $\theta_{i}$ . With this the right- hand side for the  $g_{i}$  can be calculated, and the tridiagonal matrix for  $g_{i}$  can be inverted. At this point new values for  $\phi_{i}$  may be determined, etc. Once the iteration has converged, the net heat flux is obtained from

$$
\Psi_{i} = \frac{2N}{\Delta\tau}\left(\theta_{i - 1} - \theta_{i + 1}\right) + \frac{2}{3\Delta\tau} (g_{i - 1} - g_{i + 1}).
$$

Some sample results are included in Figs. 22- 1 and 22- 2 for comparison with the exact results. It is observed that the accuracy of the temperature profile is as expected from the differential approximation

(cf. Chapters 15 and 16). Also as expected, the accuracy improves with increasing  $N$ , i.e., when conduction dominates more and more over radiation. Similar observations hold true for the evaluation of net heat fluxes.

Wang and Tien [17] apparently were the first ones to employ the  $P_{1}$ - or differential approximation for combined radiation and conduction.

# Additive Solutions

Since the evaluation of simultaneous heat transfer by conduction and radiation is rather cumbersome, it is tempting to treat each mode of energy transfer separately (as if the other one weren't there), followed by adding the two resulting heat fluxes. This simple method gives the correct heat flux for the two limiting situations (when only a single mode of heat transfer is present). The question is, how accurate is the method for intermediate situations?

The energy flux by pure steady- state conduction through a one- dimensional slab of thickness  $L$  is given by

$$
q_{c} = k\frac{T_{1} - T_{2}}{L}, \tag{22.23}
$$

while the radiative heat flux for a gray, nonscattering medium at radiative equilibrium, confined between two isothermal black plates is, from Example 15.5,

$$
q_{R} = \frac{n^{2}\sigma(T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4})}{1 + \frac{3}{4}\tau_{L}}, \tag{22.24}
$$

where we have used the result obtained from the differential approximation, in order to make a closed- form expression possible. Adding these two heat fluxes yields the approximate net heat flux, which, in nondimensional form, may be written as

$$
\Psi = \frac{q}{n^2\sigma T_1^4}\simeq \frac{4N}{\tau_L} (1 - \theta_L) + \frac{1 - \theta_L^4}{1 + \frac{3}{4}\tau_L}, \tag{22.25}
$$

which is also included in Fig. 22- 2. It is observed that the additive solution is surprisingly accurate. Einstein [18] and Cess [19] have shown that the method is within  $10\%$  of exact results for black plates, although somewhat larger errors are observed for strongly reflecting surfaces. Zeng and coworkers [20] have applied the method to somewhat nongray materials, and Howell [21] has demonstrated the relative accuracy of the method for concentric cylinders. Since the method has no physical foundation, it is impossible to predict its accuracy for general geometries. In addition, the method cannot be used to predict the temperature field, since pure conduction and pure radiation each predict their own—conflicting—profiles.

# Other Work

Since the early 1960s numerous articles on combined conduction- radiation problems have appeared in the literature. Most of the early papers dealt with very simple one- dimensional problems [2- 4, 17, 22- 27]. A number of investigations dealt with the effects of scattering in a one- dimensional slab [28- 51]; others considered spectral/nongray effects in varying degrees of sophistication [44, 46, 47, 52- 65]. The effects of external irradiation on the combined- mode heat transfer in a one- dimensional slab have been discussed in various investigations [5, 57, 62, 66- 73] and the influence of transient conduction in others [5, 34, 41, 50, 51, 62, 70- 86]. Others considered variable property effects (thermal conductivity and/or radiative properties) [42, 43, 49], some studied ultrafast effects (hyperbolic conduction) [51, 73], and others again applied inverse analysis to infer properties from experimental measurements [12, 48, 87]. Various numerical

FIGURE 22-4Melting zones within a semi-infinite body: (a) opaque medium, (b) semitransparent medium.

schemes for the solution of the governing nonlinear integro- differential equation have been employed, such as collocation with  $B$ - spline trial functions [88], collocation with Chebyshev polynomials [38], Galerkin methods [33,34], and finite- element methods [34]. In addition to the "exact" integral expressions, a number of different approximate methods were used to evaluate the radiative heat flux, such as the diffusion method [45,63,65,70,89], the two- flux method [29,44,47,72,77,90,91], the exponential kernel approximation [4,50,64,72], the  $P_N$ - approximation or variations of it [13,17,35,48,49,74], the discrete ordinates method [41- 43,46,51,65,87,92- 96], the zonal method [60], the Monte Carlo method [37,97- 99], and others. The few available experimental measurements of conduction- radiation interaction demonstrate the validity of theoretical models for glass [95, 100, 101], aerogel [6, 102], glass particles [38], fiberglass [36], porous media [103], packed spheres [46], and gases [104].

While the majority of investigations have dealt with the interaction in a one- dimensional slab, other geometries have been increasingly considered, such as one- dimensional spheres [21, 105- 110], one- dimensional cylinders [91, 99, 111- 116], and rectangular and other two- and three- dimensional configurations [13, 37, 63, 87, 92- 96, 117- 125].

# 22.3 MELTING AND SOLIDIFICATION WITH INTERNAL RADIATION

Melting and solidification of materials is of importance in many applications and has been studied for over a century. Until the 1950s attention had been focused exclusively on melting and solidification of opaque materials, i.e., situations where the influence of internal radiative heat transfer may be neglected. Early investigations into the effects of radiation have assumed that, as in the case of opaque bodies, there is a distinct interface between liquid and solid zones [126- 136], even though meteorologists had already realized that internal melting may occur within ice (e.g., [137, 138]). Chan and coworkers [139] postulated that there exists a two- phase zone between the pure liquid and pure solid zones, as shown schematically in Fig. 22- 4. The existence of such a two- phase layer in the presence of an internal radiation field may be explained as follows. Consider the melting of a semi- infinite solid, which is initially isothermal at its melting temperature  $T_m$ . A constant radiative heat flux is supplied to the face of the solid, as indicated in Fig. 22- 4. If the material is opaque, the incident heat flux is absorbed by a thin surface layer at  $x = 0$ , and heat transfer inside the medium is by conduction alone. Melting then

![](images/621cd660709e9bcd32b287acd209460c0c8bd00a808709ab1770d5ef93d9ba89.jpg)  
FIGURE 22-5 Solidification of a semitransparent liquid at  $T_{\infty}$ , subjected to a cold boundary  $T_{w}$  ( $T_{w} < T_{m} < T_{\infty}$ ).

proceeds with a distinct interface as indicated in Fig. 22- 4a, and as described in many papers and textbooks, e.g., [140]. If the material is semitransparent the external radiation penetrates deep into the solid, and some of the energy is absorbed internally, say, in the strip  $dx$ . This absorbed energy cannot be conducted away (the solid is isothermal at  $T_{m}$ ), nor can it raise the sensible heat without first melting the solid within the layer. Since the amount of energy absorbed over a short period of time cannot be sufficient to melt all of the material within the layer  $dx$  instantaneously, only gradual—and, therefore, partial—melting can be expected. As the amount of absorbed energy decreases for increasing distance away from the surface, the melt fraction will decrease along with it. For the more general case, if there is solid at temperatures below the melting point, absorbed radiative energy will be used first to raise the sensible heat of the material, resulting in a purely solid zone. Similar conclusions about the existence of a two- phase zone or "mushy zone" can be reached by replacing the external heat flux by a hot surface (with its surface emission), or by considering solidification rather than melting.

For the illustrative purposes of the present section, we will limit our consideration to a semi- infinite body, which is originally liquid and isothermal at temperature  $T_{\infty}$  ( $T_{\infty} > T_{m}$ , the melting temperature of the medium). For times  $t > 0$  the temperature of the face at  $x = 0$  is changed to, and kept at, a temperature  $T_{w}$ , which is lower than the melting/solidification temperature  $T_{m}$ . This results in a three- layer system with a qualitative temperature distribution as shown in Fig. 22- 5. To keep the analysis simple, we will further assume that liquid and solid have identical and constant properties ( $k_{l} = k_{s} = k$ ,  $\kappa_{l} = \kappa_{s} = \kappa$ , etc.), that the medium does not scatter, and that the face is black ( $\epsilon_{w} = 1$ ). Consideration of variable properties, different boundary conditions, different geometry, and/or melting instead of freezing is straightforward (but very tedious) and will not be discussed here. In the following pages we will set up the relevant energy equations governing the three zones, and the boundary conditions that they require, following the development of Chan and coworkers [139].

Pure Solid Region If, at  $t = 0$ , the temperature of the face is lowered instantaneously to  $T_{w} < T_{m}$ , this requires the instantaneous formation of an (infinitely thin) layer of pure solid, which will grow with time. The governing equation for the temperature within the solid zone follows from equation (10.72) as

$$
\rho c\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = k\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2} -\frac{dq_R}{dx}, \tag{22.26}
$$

which—assuming for now the location of the solid- mushy zone interface  $X_{1}(t)$  to be known—requires an initial condition and two boundary conditions, that is,

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{t=0:}&{T(x,0)=T_{\infty},}\\{x=0:}&{T(0,t)=T_w,}\\{x=X_1(t):}&{T(X_1,t)=T_m.}\end{array} \tag{22.27c}
$$

We defer, for the moment, the evaluation of the radiative heat flux since this is done in the same way for all three zones.

Two- Phase Region (Mushy Zone) In the presence of a two- phase region, at least a part of the solidification takes place over a finite volume (rather than only at a distinct interface). Since during solidification the medium releases heat in the amount of  $L\mathrm{J / kg}$  (where  $L$  is the heat of fusion), this gives rise to a volumetric heat source in the amount of

$$
Q^{\prime \prime \prime} = L\dot{m}_s^{\prime \prime \prime} = L\rho_s\dot{V}_s^{\prime \prime \prime} = L\rho_s\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial t}, \tag{22.28}
$$

where  $\dot{m}_s^{\prime \prime \prime}$  and  $\dot{V}_s^{\prime \prime \prime}$  are the mass and volume of solid formed per unit time and volume, respectively,  $\rho_{s}$  is the density of the pure solid, and  $f_{s}$  is the local solid fraction. Thus, with this heat source the energy equation (10.72) becomes

$$
\rho c\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = k\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2} -\frac{dq_R}{dx} +\rho L\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial t}, \tag{22.29}
$$

where we have omitted the subscript  $s$  from  $\rho_{s}$  in the heat source term, since we assume that  $\rho_{s} = \rho_{l} = \rho = \mathrm{const}$ . Since everywhere within the two- phase zone liquid and solid coexist and are assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium, this implies that the temperature in the mushy zone is uniformly at the melting point, and there can be no sensible heat change  $(\partial T / \partial t = 0)$  and no conduction  $(\partial^{2}T / \partial x^{2} = 0)$ . Thus, the energy equation simply becomes a relationship for the determination of the solid fraction, or

$$
\frac{\partial f_s}{\partial t} = \frac{1}{\rho L}\frac{dq_R}{dx}, \tag{22.30}
$$

subject to the initial condition

$$
t = 0:f_s(x,0) = 0. \tag{22.31}
$$

Pure Liquid Region The energy equation for the pure liquid region is identical to the one for the solid, but with different boundary conditions since the zone extends from  $x = X_{2}(t)$  to  $x\rightarrow \infty$ :

$$
\begin{array}{c}{\rho c\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = k\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2} -\frac{dq_R}{dx},}\\ {t = 0:\qquad T(x,0) = T_\infty ,}\\ {x = X_2(t):\qquad T(X_2,t) = T_m,}\\ {x\to \infty :\qquad T(\infty ,t) = T_\infty .} \end{array} \tag{22.33b}
$$

Radiative Heat Flux The radiative heat flux within a semitransparent, semi- infinite medium bounded by a black wall, as well as its divergence, are readily found from equations (14.54) through (14.36):

$$
\begin{array}{c}{q_R(\tau) = 2\left[E_{bw}E_3(\tau) + \int_0^\tau E_b(\tau ')E_2(\tau -\tau ')d\tau -\int_\tau^\infty E_b(\tau ')E_2(\tau ' - \tau)d\tau '\right],}\\ {\frac{dq_R}{d\tau} (\tau) = 4E_b(\tau) - 2\left[E_{bw}E_2(\tau) + \int_0^\infty E_b(\tau ')E_1(|\tau -\tau ')d\tau '\right],} \end{array} \tag{22.35}
$$

where  $\tau = \kappa x$  is the usual optical coordinate, and we assume here that the absorption coefficient is constant and the same for both liquid and solid. Note that  $q_{R}(\tau)$  and  $dq_{R} / d\tau$  are continuous everywhere, including interfaces (which is not true for the divergence of the conductive heat flux, as we will see from the interface conditions below).

![](images/e7890be05ee8184578fc1351590f74c5f0e4124f3cb11ca43159cb6f910076f3.jpg)  
FIGURE 22-6 Energy balance at the moving interface between solid and mushy zones.

Interface Conditions Finally, we need two conditions for the determination of the location of the two interfaces between solid and mushy zones,  $X_{1}(t),$  and between mushy zone and pure liquid,  $X_{2}(t)$  . These are obtained by performing energy balances over infinitesimal volumes adjacent to the interface, as depicted in Fig. 22- 6. Consider a volume of thickness  $dX_{1}$  at the solid- mushy zone interface,  $dX_{1}$  being the thickness that becomes purely solid over a time period  $dt$  . An energy balance gives:

energy conducted in at  $X_{1}(t)+$  energy radiated in at  $X_{1}(t)+$  energy released during dt  $=$  energy conducted out at  $X_{1}(t + dt)+$  energy radiated out at  $X_{1}(t + dt),$

$$

where the subscripts  $\pm 0$  imply locations on the left of the interface  $(- 0)$ , i.e., in the solid, and on the right of the interface  $(+0)$ , i.e., in the mushy zone. The heat release term contains the factor  $(1 - f_{s})$  because the fraction  $f_{s}$  is already solid. Noting that  $T = T_{m} =$  const inside the mushy zone, it follows that  $\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} \big|_{X_{1} + dX_{1} + 0} = 0$ . The radiative heat flux, on the other hand, is continuous and cancels out from the interface condition once  $dt$  and  $dX_{1}$  are shrunk to zero, and equation (22.36) becomes simply

$$
x = X_{1}(t):\quad -k\left.\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right|_{X_{1} - 0} + \rho L(1 - f_{s})\frac{dX_{1}}{dt} = 0, \tag{22.37}
$$

subject to

$$
t = 0:\qquad X_1(0) = 0. \tag{22.38}
$$

Note that there does not appear to be any requirement of  $f_{s} \to 1$  at the interface (smooth transition from mushy zone to pure solid).

Similar to equation (22.36) we find for the mushy zone- liquid interface

$$
-k\left.\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right|_{X_2 - 0}dt + q_R(X_2)dt + \rho Lf_sdX_2 = -k\left.\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right|_{X_2 + dX_2 + 0}dt + q_R(X_2 + dX_2)dt, \tag{22.39}
$$

where  $(1 - f_{s})$  is replaced by  $f_{s}$  since the fraction  $f_{s}$  solidifies from pure liquid. Upon shrinking  $dt$  and  $dX_{2}$ , the  $q_{R}$  cancel again, and the conduction term within the mushy zone vanishes, or

$$
\rho Lf_{s}\frac{dX_{2}}{dt} = -k\left.\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\right|_{X_{2} + 0}. \tag{22.40}
$$

FIGURE 22-7 Solidification of a semi-infinite, semitransparent medium initially isothermal at melting temperature: development of solid and mushy zones;  $\theta_{w} = T_{w} / T_{m} = 0.9$ ,  $N = k\kappa /4n^{2}\sigma T_{m}^{3} = 0.75$ ,  $\mathrm{Ste} = L / cT_{m} = 500$ ,  $t^* = 2\kappa n^{2}\sigma (T_{m}^{4} - T_{w}^{4})t / \rho L$ .

Now, in order for freezing to occur, we must have  $dX_{2} / dt > 0$  and  $\partial T / \partial x\geq 0$ . Since the solid fraction must be nonnegative, this implies that the left- hand side of equation (22.40) should be positive and the right- hand side should be negative. This apparent contradiction can be overcome only if both sides of equation (22.40) are identically equal to zero, or,

$$
x = X_{2}(t):\qquad f_{s}(X_{2},t) = 0,\quad \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} (X_{2},t) = 0. \tag{22.41}
$$

This implies that there is no distinct interface between mushy zone and liquid. Temperature, heat flux, and solid fraction are continuous across this "interface." Mathematically, one distinguishes between mushy zone and pure liquid, since in the mushy zone  $f_{s}$  is the unknown variable (  $T = T_{m}$  is known), and in the liquid zone the temperature is unknown (  $f_{s} = 0$  is known). The location of interface  $X_{2}$  is found implicitly by evaluating  $f_{s}(x,t)$  and determining the location where  $f_{s} = 0$

In summary, in order to predict the solidification of a semitransparent solid, it is necessary to simultaneously solve equations (22.26) and (22.27) (solid), equations (22.30) and (22.31) (mushy zone), and equations (22.32) and (22.33) (liquid), together with the interface conditions, equations (22.37) and (22.41). Note that—for an opaque medium—the radiative source within the medium vanishes ( $q_{R} = 0$ ) and, from equations (22.30) and (22.31),  $f_{s}(x,t) = 0$ ; that is, the mushy zone shrinks to a point, collapsing the two interfaces as expected for pure conduction. This system of equations is nonlinear, even in the absence of radiation, making exact analytical solutions impossible to find. Chan and coworkers [139] have presented approximate results for a few simple situations. For example, Fig. 22- 7 shows the development of the solid and mushy zones for the case of a liquid that is initially uniform at melting temperature.

Example 22.3. Consider a large (i.e., semi- infinite) block of clear ice exposed to solar radiation on one of its faces. The ice is initially at a uniform  $0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , i.e., at its melting temperature. Heat transfer from the surfaces of the ice (except the solar irradiation) may be neglected, as may the radiative emission from within the ice. Determine the development of the mushy zone for small times. Indicate how the movement of the liquid- mushy zone interface may be calculated.

# Solution

Since the side walls are insulated, the problem is one- dimensional; and since the block is "very large," we may assume that it is essentially a semi- infinite body with solar irradiation on its (otherwise insulated) left face at  $x = 0$ . Since, in this example, we consider the melting of a solid, the order of zones is reversed, i.e., we have pure liquid for  $0\leq x\leq X_{1}$ , the mushy zone for  $X_{1}< x< X_{2}$ , and pure solid for  $x > X_{2}$ . In the present example  $X_{2}\to \infty$ , since the ice is everywhere at the melting point. Also, since the face temperature is not increased abruptly, there is no instantaneous formation of a pure liquid layer and  $X_{1} = 0$  for some time  $t > 0$ . The solar irradiation is not absorbed by the surface but penetrates into the

ice, causing a local radiative heat flux—if emission from and scattering by the ice is neglected—of

$$
q_{k}(x) = q_{\mathrm{sol}}e^{-\kappa x},
$$

where  $q_{\mathrm{sol}}$  is the strength of solar irradiation penetrating into the ice (after losing some of its strength due to reflection at the interface at  $x = 0$ ) (see Chapter 19).

The purely liquid zone is essentially described by equations (22.26) and (22.27):

$$
\begin{array}{l}\rho c\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = k\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2} +q_{\mathrm{sol}}\kappa e^{-\kappa x},\\ \displaystyle t = t_0:\quad T(x,t_0) = T_m,\\ \displaystyle x = 0:\quad \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} (x,t) = 0,\\ \displaystyle x = X_1(t):\quad T(X_1,t) = T_m, \end{array}
$$

where  $t_0$  is the time at which a purely liquid zone starts to exist, and the boundary condition at  $x = 0$  has been replaced to reflect the lack of heat transfer at the surface.

The heat generation term of equation (22.28) becomes a sink, and, while the expression is correct as is, it appears more logical to work with a liquid fraction,  $f_{l} = 1 - f_{s}$ , in the case of melting. Thus, equation (22.30) becomes

$$
\frac{\partial f_l}{\partial t} = -\frac{1}{\rho L}\frac{dq_k}{dx} = \frac{q_{\mathrm{sol}}\kappa}{\rho L} e^{-\kappa x},
$$

$$
t = 0:\quad f_l(0) = 0.
$$

Finally, the interface equation at  $x = X_{1}(t)$  must be rewritten as

$$
-k\frac{\partial T}{\partial x}\bigg|_{X_1 - 0} = \rho L(1 - f_l)\frac{dX_1}{dt},
$$

$$
t = t_0:\quad X_1 = 0,
$$

where  $f_{s}$  has been replaced by  $f_{l},$  and  $L$  by  $- L$  (since melting requires heat rather than releasing it). Since  $\partial T / \partial x = 0$  at  $x = 0$  no liquid layer can grow until  $f_{l} = 1$  at  $x = 0$  . After this has taken place (at time  $t = t_0)$  the temperature may rise at  $x = 0$  , and  $\partial T / \partial x$  becomes negative at  $x = X_{1} - 0;$  therefore,  $f_{l}(X_{1})$  must diminish again, and  $dX_{1} / dt > 0$

For times  $t < t_0$ , the equation for the mushy zone is readily solved, leading to

$$
f_{l}(x,t) = \frac{q_{\mathrm{sol}}\kappa t}{\rho L} e^{-\kappa x},\qquad 0 = X_{1}(t)< x< \infty .
$$

From this relationship it follows that a purely liquid zone starts at

$$
t_0 = \frac{\rho L}{q_{\mathrm{sol}}\kappa},
$$

that is, when  $f_{l} = 1$  at  $x = 0$  . For times larger than  $t_0,$  the relation for the liquid fraction,  $f_{l}(x,t),$  within the mushy zone continues to hold, but only for  $x\geq X_{1} > 0$  . The temperature profile within the liquid zone and the location of its interface must be determined by simultaneously solving the conduction and interface equations (with known values of  $f_{l}$  -

Since the original postulation by Chan and coworkers [139], the notion of a mushy zone has found widespread acceptance among other researchers [86, 141–144].

# 22.4 COMBINED RADIATION AND CONVECTION IN BOUNDARY LAYERS

In this section we will briefly discuss how at high temperatures the presence of thermal radiation affects the temperature distribution in a thermal boundary layer and, therefore, the heat transfer

![](images/d3d51e9ca59dcc569bd0d03919903817c6e65ae5d22948168db299fe9c4ab5a4.jpg)  
FIGURE 22-8Laminar flow of an absorbing/emitting fluid over an isothermal gray-diffuse plate.

rate to or from a wall. Again, since we are mainly interested in the basic nature of interaction between convective and radiative heat transfer, we will limit ourselves to a single simple case, laminar flow over a flat plate.

Consider steady, laminar flow of a viscous, compressible, absorbing/emitting (but not scattering) gray fluid over an isothermal gray- diffuse plate, as illustrated in Fig. 22- 8. Making the standard boundary layer assumptions [145], conservation of mass, momentum, and energy follow as

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (\rho u) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (\rho v) = 0,\\ \displaystyle \rho \left(u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} +v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) - \frac{dp}{dx},\\ \displaystyle \rho c_{L}\left(u\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} +v\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(k\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\right) - \frac{\partial q_{R}}{\partial y} +\mu \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right)^{2}, \end{array} \tag{22.44}
$$

subject to the boundary conditions

$$
\begin{array}{rlr}x = 0: & u(0,y) = u_{\infty}, & T(0,y) = T_{\infty};\\ y = 0: & u(x,0) = v(x,0) = 0, & T(x,0) = T_{\infty};\\ y\to \infty : & u(x,\infty) = u_{\infty}, & T(x,\infty) = T_{\infty}. \end{array} \tag{22.45b}
$$

Equations (22.43) and (22.44) incorporate the standard boundary layer assumptions of  $\partial u / \partial y \gg \partial u / \partial x$  and  $\partial T / \partial y \gg \partial T / \partial x$  (momentum and heat transfer rates across the boundary layer are much larger than along the plate, which is dominated by convection), as well as the simplified dissipation function  $(\partial u / \partial y)^2$ . Similarly, one may drop the  $x$ - wise radiation term in favor of the radiative heat flux across the boundary layer. This is readily justified by using the diffusion approximation to get an order- of- magnitude estimate for the radiative heat flux: From equation (15.20),  $\mathbf{q}_R = - k_R N T$ , and—since  $\partial T / \partial y \gg \partial T / \partial x$ —radiation along the plate may be neglected as compared to radiation across the boundary layer. Therefore, assuming that the radiative heat flux is one- dimensional,  $q_R$  may be approximated from equation (14.54) (with  $\tau = \int_0^y \kappa dy$  and  $\tau_L \to \infty$ ) as<sup>3</sup>

$$
q_{R}(x,y) = 2J_{w}(x)E_{3}(\tau) + 2\int_{0}^{\tau}E_{b}(x,\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau -\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime} - 2\int_{\tau}^{\infty}E_{b}(x,\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau^{\prime} - \tau)d\tau^{\prime}, \tag{22.46}
$$

and

$$
\frac{1}{\kappa}\frac{\partial q_{R}}{\partial y} (x,y) = \frac{\partial q_{R}}{\partial\tau} = 4E_{b}(x,\tau) - 2J_{w}E_{2}(\tau) - 2\int_{0}^{\infty}E_{b}(x,\tau^{\prime})E_{1}(|\tau -\tau^{\prime}|)d\tau^{\prime}. \tag{22.47}
$$

Alternatively, the radiative heat flux may be evaluated from any of the approximate methods discussed in Chapter 15.

It should be remembered that photons carry momentum, thus causing radiation pressure and radiation stress (cf. Section 1.8), and that a control volume stores radiative energy [cf. equation (10.20) and Section 10.7]. However, these effects are generally negligible except at extremely high temperatures  $(>50,000\mathrm{K}$  at 1 atm pressure) [146, 147] and will not be included here.

To improve the clarity of development, we will make the additional assumptions of constant fluid properties  $(\rho ,c_{p},\mu ,k,\kappa = \mathrm{const})$ , slow flow (negligible dissipation term), a black plate  $[\epsilon_{w} = 1,$  or  $J_{w} = E_{b}(T_{w}) = E_{bw}]$ , and constant free stream values  $(u_{\infty},T_{\infty} = \mathrm{const})$ . Then equations (22.42) through (22.44) and (22.47) reduce to

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} +\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 0, \tag{22.48}
$$

$$
u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} +v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = \nu \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial y^2}, \tag{22.49}
$$

$$
u\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} +v\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2T}{\partial y^2} -\frac{1}{\rho c_p}\frac{\partial q_R}{\partial y}, \tag{22.50}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial q_{R}}{\partial y} = 2\kappa \Big[2E_{b}(x,\tau) - E_{bw}E_{2}(\tau) - \int_{0}^{\infty}E_{b}(x,\tau^{\prime})E_{1}(|\tau -\tau^{\prime}|)d\tau^{\prime}\Big], \tag{22.51}
$$

subject to boundary conditions (22.45). Here  $\nu = \mu /\rho$  is the kinematic viscosity, and  $\alpha = k / \rho c_{p}$  is the thermal diffusivity. Introducing the stream function  $\psi$  as

$$
u = \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y},\quad v = -\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}, \tag{22.52}
$$

eliminates the continuity equation and transforms the momentum and energy equations to

$$
\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x\partial y} -\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial y^2} = \nu \frac{\partial^3\psi}{\partial y^3}, \tag{22.53}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} -\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}\frac{\partial T}{\partial y} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2T}{\partial y^2} -\frac{1}{\rho c_p}\frac{\partial q_R}{\partial y}. \tag{22.54}
$$

Making the standard coordinate transformation from  $x$  and  $y$  to the nondimensional  $\xi$  and  $\eta$ , where

$$
\xi = \frac{4n^2\sigma T_{\infty}^3\kappa x}{\rho c_p\mu_{\infty}},\quad \eta = \left(\frac{u_{\infty}}{\nu x}\right)^{1 / 2}y, \tag{22.55}
$$

and introducing new nondimensional dependent variables

$$
f = \frac{\psi}{(\nu u_{\infty}x)^{1 / 2}},\quad \theta = \frac{T}{T_{\infty}},\quad \Psi_{_R} = \frac{q_{_R}}{n^2\sigma T_{\infty}^4} \tag{22.56}
$$

reduces the momentum and energy equations to

$$
\frac{d^3f}{d\eta^3} +\frac{1}{2} f\frac{d^2f}{d\eta^2} = 0, \tag{22.57}
$$

$$
\frac{1}{\mathrm{Pr}}\frac{\partial^2\theta}{\partial\eta^2} +\frac{1}{2} f\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial\eta} = \frac{df}{d\eta}\xi \frac{\partial\theta}{\partial\xi} +\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{\xi}{N\mathrm{Pr}}\right)^{1 / 2}\frac{\partial\Psi_R}{\partial\eta}. \tag{22.58}
$$

In this equation  $\mathrm{Pr} = \nu /\alpha = \mu c_p / k$  is the Prandtl number of the fluid, and  $N$  is the conduction- to- radiation parameter previously introduced as

$$
N\equiv \frac{k\kappa}{4n^2\sigma T_\infty^3}. \tag{22.59}
$$

Sometimes, a convection- to- radiation parameter, or Boltzmann number, is also introduced, which is defined as

$$
\mathrm{Bo}\equiv \frac{\rho c_n u_\infty}{n^2\sigma T_\infty^3} = 4\left(\frac{N\mathrm{Re}_x\mathrm{Pr}}{\xi}\right)^{1 / 2}, \tag{22.60}
$$

where  $\mathrm{Re}_x = u_\infty x / \nu$  is the local Reynolds number. Very similar to the conduction- to- radiation parameter  $N$ , the Boltzmann number gives a qualitative measure of the relative magnitudes of convective and radiative heat fluxes.

Equation (22.57) contains no  $\xi$ - derivative since  $\eta$  turns out to be a similarity variable, i.e., no term in the equation (except the  $\xi$ - derivative) contains  $\xi$ , and the boundary conditions for  $f$  do not depend on  $\xi$ , collapsing to

$$
\eta = 0:\quad f = \frac{df}{d\eta} = 0,\qquad \eta \to \infty :\quad \frac{df}{d\eta} = 1. \tag{22.61}
$$

Thus, equation (22.57) is an ordinary differential equation for the unknown  $f$ , which is a function of the similarity variable  $\eta$  alone. Equation (22.57) and its solution was first given by Blasius and is well documented in fluid mechanics texts, such as [148]. The energy equation (22.58) is a partial differential equation for the unknown  $\theta$ , subject to the boundary conditions

$$
\begin{array}{ll}\eta = 0: & \theta = \frac{T_w}{T_\infty} = \theta_w,\quad \eta \to \infty : \theta = 1,\\ \xi = 0: & \theta = 1. \end{array} \tag{22.62b}
$$

Since the boundary conditions at  $x = 0$  correspond to both  $\xi = 0$  and  $\eta \to \infty$ , equation (22.58) can also reduce to a similarity solution, but only if  $\Psi_R \propto \xi^{- 1 / 2}$ . This is not the case if  $\Psi_R$  is evaluated from equation (22.51) or most approximate methods discussed in Chapter 15. However, if the thermal boundary layer is optically very thick, so that the diffusion approximation becomes applicable, one finds from equation (15.20)

$$
\Psi_{R} = -\frac{4}{3\kappa}\frac{\partial\theta^{4}}{\partial y} = -\frac{4}{3(N\operatorname*{Pr}\xi)^{1 / 2}}\frac{\partial\theta^{4}}{\partial\eta}. \tag{22.63}
$$

This expression is substituted into equation (22.58), resulting in the ordinary differential equation

$$
\frac{1}{\operatorname*{Pr}}\frac{d^2\theta}{d\eta^2} +\frac{1}{2}\frac{f}{d\eta}\frac{d\theta}{d\eta} = -\frac{1}{3N\operatorname*{Pr}}\frac{d^2\theta^4}{d\eta^2}, \tag{22.64}
$$

since then  $\theta$  is a function of the similarity variable  $\eta$  only.

The interaction of radiation and convection in an optically thick laminar boundary layer of a gray gas was first investigated by Viskanta and Grosh [149] and others [150- 153]. Figure 22- 9 shows the similarity profile for the nondimensional temperature, as obtained using the diffusion approximation [149], for a number of different values for the conduction- to- radiation parameter  $N$ . For  $N = 10$  the temperature profile was found to be within  $2\%$  of the pure convection case (which numerically corresponds to  $N \to \infty$ ). When radiation is present, the thermal boundary layer was always found to thicken, which may be explained by the fact that radiation provides an additional means to diffuse energy. Even for strong radiation (large  $T_\infty$ ) the thickening of the thermal boundary layer may be limited if the fluid is optically thick (large  $\kappa$ ). However, if the

![](images/483e305dd40ddd2992be22f13b8eb97e25a196698a03994589c1f945dfe1d35b.jpg)

absorption coefficient is small (optically thin fluid), the thickening of the thermal boundary may become so large as to invalidate the basic boundary assumptions (i.e., the neglect of conduction and radiation in the  $x$ - direction).

Figure 22- 10 shows nondimensional radiative, conductive, and total surface heat fluxes along the plate for a representative case as evaluated by three different methods. The radiative heat flux is evaluated according to the definition in equation (22.56), and the conductive heat flux is defined as

$$
\Psi_{c} = -k\left.\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}|_{y = 0}|n^{2}\sigma T_{\infty}^{4} = -4(\frac{N}{\mathrm{Pr}\xi})^{1 / 2}\left.\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial\eta}|_{\eta = 0}, \tag{22.65}
$$

and

$$
\Psi = \Psi_{c} + \Psi_{R}. \tag{22.66}
$$

The "exact" results are a numerical solution of equation (22.58) with the radiation term evaluated from equation (22.51), as obtained by Zamuraev [154] (and reported by Viskanta [155]). In the optically thick solution  $\Psi_{R}$  is evaluated from equation (22.63) as

$$
\Psi_{R} = -\frac{4}{3(N\mathrm{Pr}\xi)^{1 / 2}}\left.\frac{\partial\theta^{4}}{\partial\eta}\right|_{\eta = 0}, \tag{22.67}
$$

and displays a simple  $\xi^{- 1 / 2}$  dependence. The optically thin solution has been taken from Cess [19, 156], who postulated a two- region temperature field consisting of a very thin conventional thermal boundary layer (in which radiation is neglected in favor of conduction) and an outer region with slowly changing temperature (in which conduction is neglected). As seen from Fig. 22- 10, the diffusion approximation predicts the wall heat flux accurately over the entire length of the plate, while the optically thin approximation fails a short distance away from the leading edge (apparently since downstream the boundary layer grows too thick to neglect radiation and/or the outer layer becomes too nonisothermal to neglect conduction). Other early optically thin models have been reported by Smith and Hassan [157] and Tabaczynski and Kennedy [158]; Pai and Tsao [159] used the exponential kernel approach, and Oliver and McFadden [160] solved the "exact" relations, equation (22.51), by the method of successive approximations, stopping after three iterations. Dissipation effects [156, 161- 163] as well as hypersonic conditions [162, 164- 166] have been considered by a number of investigators. The influences of scattering [167, 168], nongray radiation properties [169- 171], external irradiation

[172, 173], turbulent boundary layers [174- 176], as well as laminar flow across cylinders [171] and spheres [177] have also been addressed.

# 22.5 COMBINED RADIATION AND FREE CONVECTION

The effects of radiation are often even more important when combined with free convection rather than forced convection. The radiation effects on a vertical free- convection boundary layer have been modeled by Cess [178] for the optically thin case and by Arpaci [179] for the optically thin and thick cases, while Cheng and Ozisik [180] and Desrayaud and Lauriat [181] looked at isotropic scattering effects, and Krishnaprakas et al. [182] considered linear anisotropic scattering. Hossain et al. [183] used the diffusion approximation to deal with an optically thick gas next to a porous vertical plate with suction. Webb and Viskanta [184] investigated the effects of external irradiation, verifying their model with experiment [185], and a vertical square duct was studied by Yan and Li [186, 187]. Careful experimental work by Lacona and Taine [188] verified standard (no- radiation) prediction models, and showed that radiation can strongly modify free convection temperature profiles. They used holographic interferometry and laser deflection techniques to measure temperatures in nitrogen (suppression of radiation) and pure carbon dioxide (strong radiation effects).

Thermal stability of horizontal layers with radiation has also found some attention [189- 192] as has combined radiation and free convection within enclosed, particularly square cavities [193- 199] and parallel vertical plates [200,201]. In addition, horizontal [202] and vertical annuli [203] and cubical cavities [204] have been studied. The interaction between free convection and radiation in liquids was studied by Derby and coworkers [205], investigating a cylindrical container with molten glass, and by Tsukuda and colleagues [206], who considered internal radiation during Czochralski crystal growth.

Most of the above studies have been limited to the simple case of constant, gray radiation properties. Exceptions are the studies of Mesyngier and Farouk [198], who considered a  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}-$ $CO_2$  mixture in a square enclosure, using the discrete ordinates method and the weighted- sum- of- gray- gases approach, and of Bedoui and coworkers [207], who studied water vapor radiation effects on Rayleigh- Benard convection, using an exact formulation together with the ADF method. In addition, Colomer et al. [199] studied square cavities filled with  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} - \mathrm{CO}_2$  mixtures using the SLW method, and showed that nongray gas properties have very strong impact on temperature distributions in such flows.

# 22.6 COMBINED RADIATION AND CONVECTION IN INTERNAL FLOW

Forced convective heat transfer in circular and noncircular ducts, for laminar and turbulent flow, has been thoroughly studied for situations in which radiative heat transfer may be neglected. The case of a transparent medium with radiating boundaries has been briefly discussed in Section 9.3. In this section we will examine the interaction of radiation and convection for a radiatively participating medium flowing through a duct. In the spirit of the previous sections we will again limit our theoretical development to one particularly simple case, namely hydrodynamically developed laminar flow of an incompressible, constant- property fluid through a parallel- plate channel. This is commonly referred to as Poiseuille flow. This will be followed by a brief discussion of trends in more involved situations together with a review of the state- of- the- art.

# Poiseuille Flow

We will assume that the fluid is gray, absorbing, and emitting (but not scattering), and that the plates are gray and diffuse, a distance  $L$  apart, and isothermal, as indicated in Fig. 22- 11. The fully developed velocity distribution for Poiseuille flow follows readily from equations (22.48) and (22.49), setting  $u = u(y)$ , as

$$
u = 6u_{m}\frac{y}{L}\left(1 - \frac{y}{L}\right),\quad v = 0, \tag{22.68}
$$

where  $u_{m}$  is the mean velocity across the duct. Thus, the energy equation (22.50) reduces to

$$
u(y)\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = \alpha \frac{\partial^2T}{\partial y^2} -\frac{1}{\rho c_p}\frac{\partial q_R}{\partial y}, \tag{22.69}
$$

if again we limit ourselves to the case in which conduction and radiation in the flow direction (along  $x$ ) are negligible as compared to their transverse values (along  $y$ ). This is generally a good assumption for channel locations that are a few plate spacings  $L$  removed from the inlet [208]. Equation (22.69) is subject to the boundary conditions

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{x=0:}&{T=T_i,}\\{y=0,L:}&{T=T_w,}\end{array} \tag{22.70b}
$$

and the radiative heat flux may be obtained from equation (14.54) as<sup>5</sup>

$$
q_{R}(x,y) = 2J_{w}(x)[E_{3}(\tau) - E_{3}(\tau_{L} - \tau)] + 2\int_{0}^{\tau}E_{b}(x,\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau -\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime} - 2\int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}E_{b}(x,\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau^{\prime} - \tau)d\tau^{\prime}. \tag{22.71}
$$

FIGURE 22-12 Influence of optical thickness and conduction-radiation parameter on Nusselt number development in Poiseuille flow--heated wall.

The radiative heat flux could, of course, instead be evaluated by any of the approximate methods discussed in Chapter 15.

Introducing similar nondimensional variables and parameters as in the previous section,

$$
\theta = \frac{T}{T_w},\quad \Psi_R = \frac{a_w}{n^2\sigma T_w^4}, \tag{22.72a}
$$

$$
\xi = \frac{x}{L\mathrm{Re}_m\mathrm{Pr}} = \frac{x}{L}\bigg / \frac{u_mL}{\nu}\frac{\nu}{\alpha},\quad \eta = \frac{y}{L},\quad \tau = \kappa y, \tag{22.72b}
$$

$$
N = \frac{k\kappa}{4n^2\sigma T_w^3},\quad \tau_{\mathrm{L}} = \kappa L, \tag{22.72c}
$$

transforms equations (22.68) through (22.71) to

$$
6\eta (1 - \eta)\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial\xi} = \frac{\partial^2\theta}{\partial\eta^2} -\frac{\tau_{\mathrm{L}}}{4N}\frac{\mathrm{d}\Psi_{\mathrm{R}}}{d\eta}, \tag{22.73}
$$

$$
\xi = 0:\quad \theta = T_{i} / T_{w} = \theta_{i},\quad \eta = 0,1:\quad \theta = 1, \tag{22.74}
$$

$$
\Psi_{R} = 2\bigg[E_{3}(\tau) - E_{3}(\tau_{L} - \tau) + \int_{0}^{\tau}\theta^{4}(\xi ,\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau -\tau^{\prime})d\tau^{\prime} - \int_{\tau}^{\tau_{L}}\theta^{4}(\xi ,\tau^{\prime})E_{2}(\tau^{\prime} - \tau)d\tau^{\prime}\bigg], \tag{22.75}
$$

where, for simplicity, we have limited ourselves to black channel walls.

Equation (22.73) and its boundary conditions must be solved simultaneously with equation (22.75), making it a nonlinear integro- differential system. Equation (22.73) is a parabolic differential equation allowing a straightforward numerical solution technique, marching forward from  $\xi = 0$ . While, in principle, an explicit numerical solution is possible if small enough steps in  $\xi$  are taken, in practice implicit methods are employed. Because of the nonlinearity, this requires guessing the temperature field for the next  $\xi$ - location (as a function of  $\eta$ ), followed by an iterative procedure until convergence criteria are met. This scheme is then repeated for all downstream locations. The Poiseuille flow problem described here was first solved by Kurosaki [209] and, a little later, with results reported for higher temperatures (smaller  $N$ ), by Echigo and coworkers [210]. Figure 22- 12 shows the axial development of the local Nusselt

![](images/622cb20b0ec61d7246bf9781415ce6dcdb2382d81c6f816112c400ac2645b9c7.jpg)  
FIGURE 22-13 Influence of optical thickness and conduction–radiation parameter on Nusselt number development for gas–particulate flow through a tube—cooled wall.

number for the case of  $\theta_{i} = 0.5$  (cold fluid, hot wall), with the Nusselt number defined as

$$
\mathrm{Nu}_x(\xi) = \frac{q_wL}{k[T_w - T_m(\xi)]}, \tag{22.76}
$$

where  $q_{w} = q_{c} + q_{R}$  is total heat flux per unit area at the wall, by radiation and conduction. In terms of nondimensional quantities, the local Nusselt number becomes

$$
\mathrm{Nu}_x(\xi) = \frac{4}{1 - \theta_m(\xi)}\left[-\frac{\partial\theta}{\partial\eta} +\frac{\tau_L}{4N}\Psi_R\right]_{\eta = 0}. \tag{22.77}
$$

It is apparent from Fig. 22- 12 that—due to the nonlinear radiative contribution—no fully developed temperature profile, and consequently no asymptotic Nusselt number, develops. Rather, for the heated wall case  $(T_{w} > T_{i})$ , the Nusselt number goes through a minimum at a certain downstream location, behind which it tends to increase again. The location of the maximum moves toward the inlet with increasing importance of radiation. This phenomenon may be explained as follows: Downstream from the inlet the convective heat flux always decreases more rapidly than the temperature difference,  $T_{w} - T_{m}(\xi)$ , causing a steady decrease in the convective contribution to the Nusselt number; the fractional radiative heat flux, on the other hand, increases monotonically with  $x$ , leading to the observed behavior.

# Laminar and Turbulent Channel Flow

Qualitatively, the Nusselt number development for other channel flows with heated walls is the same as for Poiseuille flow (regardless of geometry, turbulent flow, presence of scattering, nongrayness, etc.). The heat transfer behavior is somewhat different if a hot fluid enters a cold- walled duct  $(T_{w}< T_{i})$ . This is shown in Fig. 22- 13 for turbulent tube flow of a gas seeded with small particles, from Azad and Modest [211]. The Nusselt number always decreases monotonically, somewhat similar to the pure convection case, and eventually appears to reach

![](images/3b43756b1e02281107f99173e63103fc0c75a69221bdc4e3c9fade7e9dc3a380.jpg)  
FIGURE 22-14Influence of optical thickness and conduction–radiation parameter on bulk temperature development for gas-particulate flow through a tube—cooled wall.

an asymptotic value. However, as seen from Fig. 22- 14, in the presence of thermal radiation this "fully developed" case is never reached until the bulk temperature is essentially equal to the wall temperature (note that, for pure convection, the bulk temperature has changed only by  $\approx 20\%$  of maximum when fully developed conditions have been reached). Therefore, it may be concluded that no thermally fully developed conditions can exist for forced convection in duct flow combined with appreciable thermal radiation (i.e., radiative heat fluxes too large to be approximated by a linear expression in temperature). This fact was not realized by a number of early investigations on the subject, which employed "thermally developed" conditions to obtain relatively simple results [212–219]. Figures 22- 13 and 22- 14 also demonstrate how temperature level and optical thickness influence the variation of Nusselt number and bulk temperature. Reducing  $N / \tau_{R}$  (which does not depend on absorption coefficient and, for a given medium and tube radius, implies raising temperatures) for a constant optical thickness results in increased heat transfer rates due entirely to an increase in radiative heat flux. The radiative heat flux goes through a maximum at an intermediate optical thickness,  $\tau_{R} \simeq 1$  (for constant  $N / \tau_{R}$ ). This is readily explained by examining the optical limits. In the optically thin limit the medium does not emit or absorb any radiation, resulting in purely convective heat transfer. On the other hand, in the optically thick limit any emitted radiation is promptly absorbed again in the immediate vicinity of the emission point, again reducing radiative heat flux to zero.

A simple one- dimensional temperature profile does exist in the case of Couette flow (two infinite parallel plates moving at different velocities), since the entire problem becomes one- dimensional. The analysis for this case reduces to the same equations arrived at in the previous section for combined conduction and radiation, which have been solved numerically by Goulard and Goulard [220] and Viskanta and Grosh [221].

As indicated earlier, the Poiseuille flow problem was originally investigated by Kurosaki [209], using the exact integral relations for the radiative heat flux. The problem had been addressed a little earlier by Timofeyev and coworkers [222], using the two- flux method. The case of slug flow between parallel plates, with rigorous modeling of the radiative heat flux, has been treated by Lii and Ozisik [223]. The influence of scattering on Poiseuille flow has been

discussed by a number of investigators [224- 227]. Yener and coworkers [228, 229] examined the same problem for turbulent flow conditions, while Echigo and Hasegawa [230] addressed a laminar, scattering gas- particulate mixture. All of these publications neglected axial radiation. Two- dimensional radiation for Poiseuille flow has been studied by Einstein [18] (nonscattering fluid) and Kassemi and Chung [231] (isotropically scattering fluid), using the zonal method, and by Kim and Lee [232] (anisotropically scattering fluid), using the discrete ordinates method. Other investigations on turbulent tube flows with gray media, also using the discrete ordinates method, include those of Kim and Baek [233,234] (two- dimensional radiation without scattering) and Krishnaprakas and coworkers [235] (one- dimensional radiation with linear- anisotropic scattering).

Combined convection and radiation in thermally developing tube flow appears to have been investigated first by Einstein [236], deSoto [208], and Echigo and coworkers [237], considering two- dimensional (axial and radial) radiation, while Bergero and colleagues [238] considered developing flow and three- dimensional, gray radiation in a laminar rectangular duct, using the finite volume method (for radiation).

The effects of nongray molecular gas radiation on laminar tube and channel flows, employing the exponential wide band model, have been studied by a number of investigators [239- 242]. Similar calculations for turbulent flows have also been carried out using fully developed flow and simple algebraic expressions for the eddy diffusivity for heat [219,240,243- 245], while Smith and coworkers [246] used the two- dimensional zonal method and weighted- sum- of- gray- gases approach. More accurate analyses, using the statistical narrow band model, narrow band  $k$ - distributions, and the global ADF model for radiation calculations, have been carried out by the group around Soufiani and Taine for laminar [170,247,248] and turbulent [249,250] tube and channel flows, the latter using the  $k - \epsilon$  turbulence model. The general trends are similar to flows of gray media, i.e., strong radiation effects are evidenced by the much faster development of the temperature profiles (resulting in larger Nusselt numbers), regardless of whether the gas is heated or cooled. However, comparison with wide band model results showed that the latter can produce significant errors in predicting temperature fields and radiative fluxes. Comparison with experiment [247], on the other hand, showed excellent agreement with temperature fields predicted from the narrow band model.

Gas- particulate suspension flows were first addressed by Echigo and colleagues [251,252] for laminar and turbulent flow of nonscattering media, respectively. Anisotropic scattering in tube suspension flows has been treated by Modest and coworkers for gray [211,253] and nongray [245] carrier gases. Nongray effects in suspension flows have also been studied by AlTurki and Smith [254], using the zonal method, while two- dimensional, gray particle radiation was considered by Park and Kim [255], using the  $P_{1}$ - approximation. Radiation effects in liquid glass jets were investigated by Yin and Jaluria [256,257] and by Song et al. [258], both using a two- dimensional stepwise gray approach together with the zonal [256,257] or discrete ordinates method [258]. Finally, there have been several attempts at modeling radiation interactions with flow through porous media [259,260] and packed beds [261- 263]. A general overview of the literature has been given by Viskanta [264]

# 22.7 COMBINED RADIATION AND COMBUSTION

Thermal radiation from gases and particulates is an important, and often the dominant heat transfer mechanism during the burning of fuel. Therefore, inclusion of an adequate radiation model is essential to the success of a mathematical model of the combustion process, particularly in large systems (with larger optical thickness). The description of the burning process is an extremely difficult task even in the absence of radiation: "complete" chemical reaction mechanisms can involve hundreds of chemical species and thousands of elementary reactions [265], modeled by a nonlinear, stiff set of simultaneous differential equations. Furthermore,

the combustion process is generally accompanied by multidimensional (perhaps two- phase) convection involving all species, as well as by turbulent mixing. Comprehensive reviews of the pertinent literature up to 1986 [266] and 2004 [267] have been given by Viskanta and Menguc. Here we will briefly discuss the particularly simple case of a laminar free convection diffusion flame, using a simple fuel (methane,  $\mathrm{CH_4}$  ), a simple global reaction mechanism,

$$
\mathrm{CH}_4 + 2\mathrm{O}_2\rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_2 + 2\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} \tag{22.78}
$$

(neglecting multistep chemistry and intermediate species generation), and a simple reaction rate model (assuming an infinitely fast reaction wherever methane and oxygen come into contact). Such analyses were carried out in early work by Negrelli and coworkers [268] for the lower stagnation region of a horizontal cylinder, and by Liu and colleagues [269] for a vertical flat plate burner.

Results for combustion- radiation interaction in a simple, laminar diffusion flame are very characteristic for all reacting flows and can, qualitatively, be applied to fairly general combustion systems. For such a flame equations (22.42) through (22.45) are changed to

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (\rho u) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (\rho v) = 0, \tag{22.79}
$$

$$
\rho \left(u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} +v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\mu \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}\right) - g(\rho_{\infty} - \rho), \tag{22.80}
$$

$$
\rho c_{p}\left(u\frac{\partial T}{\partial x} +v\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(k\frac{\partial T}{\partial y}\right) - \frac{\partial q_{R}}{\partial y} +\dot{Q}_{\mathrm{ch}}^{\prime \prime \prime}, \tag{22.81}
$$

$$
\rho \left(u\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial x} +v\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial y}\right) = \frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\rho D\frac{\partial Y_i}{\partial y}\right) + \dot{m}_i^{\prime \prime \prime},i = \mathrm{species}, \tag{22.82}
$$

subject to the boundary conditions where, for free convection, the pressure term in the momentum equation has been replaced in favor of a buoyancy term, and the dissipation function has been dropped. The energy equation now has a heat source term (due to the release of chemical energy), and diffusion equations must be added for the mass fractions  $Y_{i}$  of all species. In early work it was common practice to further simplify the problem by assuming a single mass diffusivity,  $D,$  for all species and to only consider fuel (methane,  $F_{\cdot}$  , oxidizer (oxygen,  $O$  ), and products  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{CO}_2,F)$  as independent "species." The system of equations is closed with the ideal gas law, or  $\rho T =$  const (assuming constant pressure), while the sources  $\dot{Q}_{\mathrm{ch}}^{\prime \prime \prime}$  and  $\dot{m}_i^{\prime \prime \prime}$  are calculated from the reaction kinetics. Finally, the boundary conditions are replaced by

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl} & {x = 0:} & & {u(0,y) = 0,T(0,y) = T_{\infty},Y_F = Y_P = 0,Y_O = Y_{O\infty};}\\ & {y = 0:} & & {u(x,0) = 0,v(x,0) = v_w,T(x,0) = T_w,Y_F = 1,Y_P = Y_O = 0;}\\ & {y\rightarrow \infty :} & & {u(x,\infty) = 0,T(x,\infty) = T_{\infty},Y_F = Y_P = 0,Y_O = Y_{O\infty}.} \end{array} \tag{22.83a}
$$

For the radiation term, both Negrelli [268] and Liu [269] used an exact 1D- solution of the RTE together with the wide band model to simulate the nongray radiation from the absorbing/emitting combustion gases  $(\mathrm{CH}_4,\mathrm{CO}_2,$  and  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O})$  . The above set of equations was solved by, both, Negrelli and coworkers [268] and Liu and colleagues [269] in a semianalytical way and compared with experiment. Both teams found rather good agreement between theory and experiment, especially in light of the rather primitive models. Figure 22- 15 shows an example of the results of Negrelli et al. [268], who performed their calculations also for the cases of a transparent gas (no radiation) and a gray gas (using a Planck- mean absorption coefficient based on local partial pressures). Comparison with the no- radiation solution makes it evident that radiation lowers the temperatures in the high- temperature region of the boundary layer (by more than  $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C})$  and raises them in the cooler region near the outer edge of the boundary layer. Obviously, radiation's "action at a distance" allows energy to travel directly from the hot zone to the colder

FIGURE 22-15 Experimental and theoretical temperature profiles for a laminar methane diffusion flame; from [268].

parts. It is also observed that radiation increases the thermal boundary layer thickness, for the same reasons. On the other hand, using a gray gas approximation severely overpredicts the effect of radiation on flame temperature and heat loss from the flame. The nongray gas emits and absorbs radiation across spectral lines that may be optically very thick, i.e., the emitted energy is reabsorbed in the immediate vicinity of the emission point: little emission occurs over vast parts of the spectrum ("spectral windows" with near- zero absorption coefficient). The gray approximation replaces the nongray absorption coefficient by a single, intermediate value, which predicts the correct overall emission, but (for large enough flames) strongly underpredicts reabsorption of this emission.

More recent investigations of laminar, methane diffusion flames have used more sophisticated reaction kinetics together with the CHEMKIN software [270, 271], and employed the statistical narrow band model for radiation [272, 273]. The influence of soot radiation on laminar diffusion flames has been studied for ethylene [274- 277] and acetylene flames [278]. The older investigations used simple one- step kinetics and assumed the absorption coefficient to be gray (assuming radiation to be dominated by the near- gray soot), but used different soot nucleation, growth, coagulation and oxidation models as well as different RTE solvers. The more recent ones used full chemistry and the statistical narrow band model together with nongray soot for radiation. Kaplan and coworkers [274] also assessed the importance of radiation by comparing with calculations, in which radiation was ignored. Figure 22- 16 is an example of their work, which clearly indicates that ignoring radiation, with its overprediction of temperature levels, leads to grossly overpredicted soot levels. Similar conclusions about the importance of radiative heat transfer can be drawn with respect to high- temperature production of trace pollutants, such as  $\mathrm{NO}_x$  [279,280]. Liu and coworkers [277] noted that radiation effects become much stronger under microgravity conditions.

Today, the literature on the interaction of radiative heat transfer in combustion applications is growing at a rapid pace, including investigations on turbulent jet diffusion flames [281- 289], flame spread along vertical plates [290- 293], droplet [294- 296] and packed bed [297] combustion, simulations of fires [298] and of entire furnaces [299- 305] and, very recently, of future oxy- fuel combustors [306] (designed for carbon capture). The results from all these studies are consistent with the qualitative behavior described in this section. Also notable is the finding that nongray soot modeling is of greater importance than nongray gas modeling in sooty flame simulations, with gray soot models producing large errors [289].

# 22.8 INTERFACING BETWEEN TURBULENT FLOW FIELDS AND RADIATION

The past years have seen tremendous advances in the modeling of turbulent flows and chemical reactions, as well as in the field of multidimensional, nongray radiation, each requiring their own sophisticated and time- consuming algorithms to produce accurate results. While the development of modern large eddy simulations (LES) and direct numerical simulations (DNS) is progressing at a rapid pace, most computational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations will rely on Reynolds- averaged Navier- Stokes (RANS) solution methods during the foreseeable future. In RANS calculations the Navier- Stokes equations are solved in terms of time- averaged means, with all turbulence effects being modeled. While turbulence- convection interaction is always accounted for in these schemes (with eddy diffusivities or more advanced models), the interaction between the turbulent flow field and fluctuating intensities has generally been neglected. In this section we describe how time- averaged flow fields are interfaced with radiative heat transfer calculations in the absence of such turbulence- radiation interactions (TRI). Details on Reynolds averaging and on TRI will be given in the following section.

Forced convection problems tend to be parabolic in nature (i.e., downstream conditions are irrelevant), but have enormous gradients near surfaces (as well as near combustion fronts), necessitating a very fine grid system in their vicinity. Radiation problems, on the other hand, tend to be elliptic (i.e., the entire volume needs to be considered simultaneously), and are further complicated by directional and spectral dependence of the radiative intensity. Combining high- level models for turbulence and radiation requires great care to avoid instabilities, lack of convergence, and/or exorbitant computer memory and CPU requirements. The overall algorithm generally consists of the following steps:

1. A first estimate for the local radiative heat source  $\dot{Q}_R^{\prime \prime \prime} = -\nabla \cdot \mathbf{q}_R$  is made.  
2. The flow field is calculated, including velocity, temperature (or enthalpy), and species concentrations (if chemical reactions are present). This may include several iterations for complicated flow fields that are not strictly parabolic.  
3. The absorption coefficient is calculated from the flow field as a function of pressure, temperature, and species concentrations.

![](images/c00b222973339195afb8e2a07b0cd74710703e55f30e83f17df09428a68e85ea.jpg)  
FIGURE 22-17 Combustor temperature distribution in the absence of radiation, and the three radiation meshes; from [307].

4. For the given temperature and absorption coefficient field the RTE is solved to obtain the radiative source term. Simple or sophisticated RTE solvers may be employed  $(P_{1}$  approximation, different levels of the discrete ordinates or finite volume methods, etc.), and primitive or advanced spectral models may be used (gray gas, wide band models, narrow band models,  $k$  -distributions, etc.). It is also possible to start out with relatively crude RTE solutions, moving toward more accurate models as the overall solution progresses.

5. The radiative source is updated and the calculation returns to step 2 above until some overall convergence criteria are met.

Most combined convection- radiation calculations to date have used a common spatial grid for, both, the flow field and the thermal radiation calculations. This tends to be rather inefficient in turbulent flows since the flow field solver requires many mesh points near interfaces, while the RTE solver does not. RTE solvers, on the other hand, tend to require limits on the optical thickness of its computational cells, which may also be incompatible with the flow field solver. Having two separate meshes, however, has its own drawbacks. First, interpolation back and forth between the two meshes may be computationally expensive as well as inaccurate, commonly accumulating errors that lead to instability. Also, defining a second mesh requires additional work to define its topology, as well as additional computer memory.

An efficient solution to these problems is to establish a radiation grid whose cells are combinations of several flow field cells, similar to the multigrid algorithm often used in numerical analysis (provided no flow field cell violates optical thickness restrictions of the RTE solver). This was investigated in detail by Badinand and Fransson [307] looking at the plume flow of hot combustion gases behind a jet engine. During the iteration variables relevant to radiation (pressure, temperature, species concentrations) must be transferred from the CFD grid to the radiation grid, while updated values of the radiation source must be transferred from the radiation grid to the CFD grid. Badinand and Fransson used the simplest possible passing scheme, i.e., volumetric averages from all included CFD cells to the radiation cell, and placing the radiative source evaluated for a radiation cell into each of its included CFD cells. A slightly more involved passing scheme has been described by Omori and coworkers [305]. Figure 22- 17 shows a set of meshes used by Badinand and Fransson [307] for an axisymmetric premixed combustor, and the resulting temperature field if radiation effects are neglected. Turbulence was modeled with the  $k - \epsilon$  model, while for combustion the simple eddy dissipation model with one- step kinetics was used. Only the fine mesh was used for the flow field calculations (32,625 cells), while the fine, coarse (2,727 cells) and very coarse (625 cells) meshes were used for the radiation calculations. These were carried out using a gray gas with a spatially varying Planck- mean absorption coefficient and the finite volume method of Section 17.6 with  $8 \times 8$  directions. Figure 22- 18 shows the strong effects of radiation on temperature levels inside the combustor: Hot combustion gases

lose a lot of energy due to radiative emission, lowering local temperature levels by up to  $150\mathrm{K}$ . Much of this emission travels to the walls, and some is absorbed by colder parts, raising the cold fuel- air jet temperature by  $50\mathrm{K}$ . It is also seen from Fig. 22- 18 that the choice of radiation mesh has virtually no effect on the results: As compared to the fine mesh, the temperature differences shown in the figure have errors of less than  $\pm 0.2\%$  for the coarse mesh, and less than  $\pm 0.4\%$  for the very coarse mesh. However, radiation computations are speeded up by a factor of 20 using the coarse mesh, and by a factor of 100 for the very coarse mesh.

The same scheme was employed by Soufiani and coworkers [248], while a somewhat more sophisticated approach was taken by Howell and coworkers [308] with what they term adaptive- mesh refinement (AMR). In effect, they use a multigrid algorithm for each flow field solution, and a similar but separate multigrid scheme for their discrete ordinates RTE solver. They achieved a respectable maximum CPU savings of a factor of 4, but this is considerably less than Badinand and Fransson because the RTE is, at its highest level, solved for the finest CFD grid.

# 22.9 INTERACTION OF RADIATION WITH TURBULENCE

During the development of the radiative transfer equation (RTE) in Chapter 10, we noted that heat transfer due to thermal radiation is essentially instantaneous, depending on the temporal temperature distribution as well as the temporal concentration field of the absorbing, emitting, and/or scattering medium. During turbulent flow the temperature field and, for mixtures, the concentration fields undergo rapid and irregular local oscillations (but slow compared with the response time of thermal radiation). The governing equations, such as equations (22.42) through (22.44) or equations (22.79) through (22.82), are then rewritten in terms of time- averaged quantities (denoted by an overbar), e.g.,

$$
\overline{\rho} (x,y) = \frac{1}{\delta t}\int_{\delta t}\rho (x,y,t)dt, \tag{22.84}
$$

where  $\delta t$  is the (small) time interval used for averaging. Commonly, the so- called Favre averaging (or mass- weighted averaging), denoted by a tilde, is also employed for compressible flows, that is,

$$
\widetilde{\phi} = \overline{\rho\phi} /\overline{\rho}, \tag{22.85}
$$

where  $\phi$  is the quantity to be averaged. For 2D forced convection with chemical reactions this leads to

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} (\overline{\rho}\overline{u}) + \frac{\partial}{\partial y} (\overline{\rho}\overline{v}) = 0, \tag{22.86}

where temperature has been replaced in favor of enthalpy  $h = \int \epsilon_{\eta} dT$ . In these relations  $\nu_{t}, \alpha_{t},$  and  $D_{t}$  are turbulent viscosity and heat and mass diffusivity, respectively. The source terms,  $\dot{Q}_{\mathrm{ch}}^{\prime \prime \prime}$ , and  $\dot{m}_{i}^{\prime \prime \prime}$  are strongly nonlinear functions of the  $s$  composition variables, collected into a vector  $\phi (\phi_{i} = Y_{i}, i = 1, \ldots , s - 1, \phi_{s} = h)$ , and must be determined in time- averaged form. Turbulence modeling is a field of great complexity and research interest that has seen dramatic progress during recent years. Reynolds- averaged Navier- Stokes (RANS)- based turbulence models are the most popular today, in particular the ubiquitous  $k - \epsilon$  model [309], and a number of more accurate models are also available. Another level of difficulty arises if the interaction between turbulence and a nonlinear source term is to be considered. The interaction between turbulence and chemistry has received considerable attention, resulting in flamelet models [310- 312] and PDF (probability density function) methods [313]. While very relevant for the modeling of turbulence- radiation interactions, these models go much beyond the scope of this book, and the reader is referred to the relevant literature [314- 319].

To account for the interaction between turbulence and radiation (TRI), the time- averaged radiative source must be evaluated, or

$$
\overline{Q_R^{\prime\prime\prime}} = -\overline{\nabla\cdot\mathbf{q}_R} = -\int_0\kappa_\eta \left[4\pi I_{b\eta} - \int_{4\pi}I_\eta d\Omega \right]d\eta = -\int_0^\infty \left[4\pi \overline{\kappa_\eta I_{b\eta}} -\int_{4\pi}\overline{\kappa_\eta I_\eta} d\Omega \right]d\eta . \tag{22.90}
$$

Because of their nonlinear dependence on composition variables these terms cannot be determined based on mean values. Thus, two turbulence moments or correlations are required: the correlations between absorption coefficient and Planck function,  $\overline{\kappa_{\eta}I_{\eta}}$ , and between absorption coefficient and radiative intensity,  $\overline{\kappa_{\eta}I_{\eta}}$ . The former correlation is termed

$$
Emission TRI:\qquad \overline{\kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta}}\neq \kappa_{\eta}(\widetilde{\phi})I_{b\eta}(\widetilde{T}), \tag{22.91}
$$

while the latter is known as

$$
Absorption TRI:\qquad \overline{\kappa_{\eta}I_{\eta}}\neq \kappa_{\eta}(\widetilde{\phi})I_{\eta}(\widetilde{\phi}). \tag{22.92}
$$

Absorption TRI is particularly difficult to evaluate because the fluctuations of the local intensity may be influenced by property fluctuations from everywhere in the medium. On the other hand, in some early work Kabashnikov and coworkers [320- 322] have suggested that, if the mean free path of radiation is much larger than the turbulence eddy length scale  $l_{t}$ , then the local radiative intensity is only weakly correlated with the local absorption coefficient, i.e.,

$$
Absorption TRI:\qquad \overline{\kappa_{\eta}I_{\eta}}\simeq \overline{\kappa_{\eta}I_{\eta}}. \tag{22.93}
$$

This expression, valid if  $\kappa_{\eta}l_{t}\ll 1$ , and commonly known as the (optically) thin eddy approximation, or optically thin fluctuation approximation (OTFA), simplifies the evaluation of  $\overline{Q_R^{\prime\prime\prime}}$  considerably, since the remaining correlations  $\overline{\kappa_{\eta}}$  and  $\overline{\kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta}}$  can be constructed from single- point statistics of the composition variables. Note that, in order to invoke this approximation, one must have  $\kappa_{\eta}l_{t}\ll 1$  for all wavenumbers. While this condition is generally violated by combustion gases

for very small parts of the spectrum (see, e.g., Fig. 11- 6), and also for extremely sooty flames, it is justifiable in the vast majority of applications. To date most predictions of TRI (turbulence- radiation interactions) have employed the OTFA.

Very similar to the time- averaged chemical source term, evaluation of the remaining correlations,  $\overline{\kappa_{\eta}}$  and  $\overline{\kappa_{\eta}I_{b\eta}}$ , requires equations or models for the correlations between any two composition variables, for a total of  $s^2$  moments [323]; this task is clearly not feasible with traditional RANS- based models.

Because of these difficulties radiation and turbulence have traditionally been treated as independent phenomena, i.e., the influence of turbulent fluctuations on the composition variables (that determine the local values of radiative properties, blackbody intensity and, therefore, the local radiative intensity) have been neglected. If effects of radiation are considered at all, the calculations are generally based on mean (time- averaged) composition variables. Experimental data, obtained by the groups around Faeth and Gore [324- 333] have indicated that, depending on fuel and other conditions, radiative emission from a flame may be as much as  $50\%$  to  $300\%$  higher than would be expected based on mean values of temperature and absorption coefficient. Cox [334] has shown that emission from a hot medium increases dramatically due to turbulence, simply by expanding the emissive power into a Taylor series. For example, for a simple, gray medium with constant absorption coefficient, the TRI reduce to  $\overline{\kappa I_b} = \kappa \overline{I_b} = \kappa \overline{E_b} /\pi$ , where

$$
\overline{E_b(x,y,t)} = \frac{1}{\delta t}\int_{\delta t}n^2\sigma T^4 (x,y,t)dt. \tag{22.94}
$$

If one writes temperature and its fluctuations in terms of a time average,

$$
T(x,y,t) = \overline{T} (x,y,t) + T'(x,y,t),\quad \overline{T'} = 0, \tag{22.95}
$$

then  $E_{b}(x,y,t)$  can be approximated by a truncated Taylor series as

$$
E_{b}(T)\simeq E_{b}(\overline{T}) + T^{\prime}\frac{dE_{b}}{d\overline{T}} +\frac{1}{2} (T^{\prime})^{2}\frac{d^{2}E_{b}}{d\overline{T}^{2}} +\ldots , \tag{22.96a}
$$

and

$$
\overline{E_b(T)}\simeq E_b(\overline{T}) + \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2E_b}{d\overline{T}^2}\overline{(T')^2} = \sigma \overline{T}^4\left[1 + 6\frac{\overline{(T')^2}}{\overline{T}^2}\right]. \tag{22.96b}
$$

Equation (22.96b) shows that the so- called temperature self- correlation (time- averaged emissive power) is always positive, resulting in enhanced emission due to turbulence- radiation interactions. In the present case (gray, constant- property medium) temperature fluctuations of  $\pm 30\%$  would increase emission by more than  $50\%$

In most early works on turbulence- radiation interactions the radiation calculations were not coupled with the flow field model; rather, the fluctuation fields were assumed [249,250,335- 340]. It was generally concluded that TRI are of importance only in the presence of chemical reactions (combustion of fuel), and there were some suggestions of temperature fluctuations to dominate turbulence radiation interactions. While it is now widely recognized that turbulent fluctuations affect the radiative transfer rates, the reverse is also true, i.e., radiation has an effect on temperature fluctuations in a turbulent flow. This was first recognized by Townsend [341], and has been further studied in the atmospheric sciences [342, 343] and for high- temperature gases [344, 345].

It was observed in Sections 22.4 and 22.6 that, in boundary layers and in internal flows, radiation is often dominated by its transverse component and can, thus, be approximated as one- dimensional, greatly facilitating the solution because of the parabolic nature of forced convection. Turbulent fluctuations are always transient and three- dimensional, although problems may be statistically steady and one- or two- dimensional [i.e., in a time- averaged sense, equation (22.84)]. Similarly, time- mean radiative transfer in boundary layers and in internal flows

tends to again be dominantly in the transverse direction. Sakurai and colleagues [346] have shown that, if radiation is statistically one- dimensional, TRI may be adequately evaluated with a one- dimensional RTE solver (i.e., neglecting the three- dimensionality of turbulence), greatly reducing the necessary effort.

The first study modeling TRI from basic principles was done by Mazumder and Modest [347, 348], who considered a methane- air diffusion flame and a nonreacting combustion gas mixture, respectively. Using a Monte Carlo solution to the velocity- composition PDF approach invoking the thin eddy approximation and using the box model of Section 20.4 for radiation, they were able to evaluate turbulence- radiation interactions without further approximation. Studying nonreacting flows [348], it was confirmed that, indeed, TRI are never of great importance in nonreacting flows, never changing radiative sources and fluxes by more than  $10\%$ . On the other hand, in the methane- air flame heat loss rate increases due to TRI of up to  $75\%$  beyond the temperature self- correlation were observed [347].

A systematic analysis of turbulence- radiation interactions in two- dimensional, axisymmetric, nonluminous jet diffusion flames was first carried out by Li and Modest [349- 351]. They employed a hybrid approach, using a commercial finite volume code (Fluent [352]) together with the composition PDF method [313, 319], and also invoked the thin eddy approximation (OTFA). The philosophy of the probability density function (PDF) approach is to consider the thermo- fluid variables  $(\mathbf{u},h,\mathbf{Y},$  etc.) as random variables and consider the transport of their PDFs rather than their moments. The composition PDF is the simplest form of the PDF methods since it carries information for the composition variables only, collected in the vector  $\phi$ , which contains the  $s - 1$  mass fractions  $\mathbf{Y}$  and the enthalpy  $h$ . The great advantage of PDF methods is that the mean for any quantity, say a source  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}$ , can be evaluated directly from the PDF, provided  $\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}$  is a function of local composition variables  $\phi$  only. This leads to

$$
\overline{\dot{Q}^{\prime\prime\prime}} = \int_{0}^{\infty}f(\psi)\dot{Q}^{\prime \prime \prime}(\psi)d\psi , \tag{22.97}
$$

where  $\psi$  represents the sample space for the composition variables  $\phi$  (for example,  $0\leq \psi_{s}< \infty$  is the range of values that the last composition variable,  $\phi_{s} = h,$  can attain);  $f(\psi)$  is the probability density of the compound event of  $\phi = \psi$  (i.e.,  $\phi_{1} = \psi_{1},\phi_{2} = \psi_{2},\ldots ,\phi_{s} = \psi_{s}$ ), so that

$$
f(\psi)d\psi = \mathrm{probability}(\psi \leq \phi \leq \psi +d\psi). \tag{22.98}
$$

The transport equation for the composition PDF for radiating reactive flow has been developed by Li and Modest [349] based on the extensive work of Pope [313]. This resulted in a partial differential equation in  $s + 4$  independent variables (time, space, and composition variable space), which—because of its high dimensionality—must be solved through stochastic particle tracing [313, 319, 353, 354]. The composition PDF carries no information on the velocity field and, therefore, must be combined with another solver to provide the solutions to the mean momentum equations as well as a turbulence model (such as  $k - \epsilon$ ).

Li and Modest employed a simple single- step mechanism for chemistry, and the FSK method of Section 20.8 together with the  $P_{1}$ - approximation for the evaluation of thermal radiation from the combustion gases  $(\mathrm{CO}_{2},\mathrm{H}_{2}\mathrm{O},$  and  $\mathrm{CH_4}$ ). Flames were characterized through nondimensional parameters, namely Reynolds number Re (describing jet velocity, flame size, turbulence level), optical thickness  $\tau_{L}$  (flame size), Damköhler number Da (flow time scale vs. chemical reaction time scale) and Froude number Fr (buoyancy effects), and their impact on turbulence- radiation interactions was assessed. Their base configuration was Sandia Flame D [355], for which an abundance of experimental measurements is available (including radiation data). However, Sandia D is a small laboratory flame (as are most experimentally documented flames) with, therefore, relatively little radiation. Thus, Li and Modest also studied flames scaled up

by factors of 2 and 4 to determine radiation and TRI effects in larger flames. It was found that TRI affect the flame in two ways: (1) emission from and self- absorption by the flame are both strongly, and about equally, increased, and (2) the additional net heat loss causes the flame to cool (and this, in turn, can substantially lower emission as well as chemical reaction rates to the point of flame extinction). Not surprisingly, the strength of TRI is most strongly sensitive to the flame's optical thickness. Optically thin flames lose relatively little heat by radiation; TRI cause this loss to increase by a substantial  $50\%$ , but decrease flame temperature only by a small amount (maybe  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ ). This additional heat loss causes optically thick flames to cool down substantially (by  $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  and more), resulting in a sharp drop in emissive power, and overall heat loss rates are only increased by a few percent.

To isolate the importance of the various turbulence interactions that combine for the total TRI effect, Li and Modest [350] looked at "frozen" composition variable fields for several flames (using the converged temperature and species mass fraction fields for the flame with fully considered TRI). They determined the various radiative contributions to flame emission and self- absorption under a number of different scenarios. It was found that, on a percentage basis, the increase in radiative heat losses due to TRI is essentially independent of optical thickness: for all three flames, both, emission and self- absorption are consistently increased by about  $60\%$ . However, in optically thin flames this translates into a net additional loss of  $50\%$ , since temperature levels (in an "unfrozen" field) decrease by only  $20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  or so. In optically thick flames TRI bring down temperature levels by more than  $100^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ , and the net heat loss is hardly increased at all. The different underlying TRI mechanisms display similarly consistent trends: if only the Planck function self- correlation is considered, emission and absorption increase by roughly  $35\%$  for a gray medium. However, if the nongrayness of the combustion gases is accounted for, this increase is less than  $10\%$ , again regardless of optical thickness (absorption lagging behind emission, since it is a response to the raised emission level). The reason is that the gas radiates only over the fairly narrow absorption- emission bands, across which the nonlinearity of the Planck function is much less severe. Even for a gray medium, for which the Planck function self- correlation is the most important driving force of the TRI, it by no means dominates the interaction. The strongest contributions to TRI always come from the correlation between absorption coefficient and Planck function fluctuations.

Several other investigators have investigated Sandia Flame D in the context of TRI [345,356- 359], most of them at a lesser level of sophistication than the work of Li and Modest [349,350], but all providing consistent answers for the quantitative importance of radiation and turbulence- radiation interactions. The most advanced and accurate model to date of Flame D is the one by Wang and coworkers [345], using models similar to those of Li and Modest, but employing a more advanced composition PDF code, a more realistic chemical reaction mechanism, and the line- by- line accurate photon Monte Carlo scheme described in Section 21.6, which was specifically developed for the stochastic media employed in transported PDF methods. As can be seen from Fig. 22- 19, their model predicts centerline temperatures very well, but also that radiation (with or without TRI) has little influence in a small, optically thin flame. Wang and coworkers also scaled up the flame by factors of 2 (KL2) and 4 (KL3) (but in a different way from Li and Modest to preserve realistic chemistry). Consistent with Li and Modest's observation they noted that increasing flame size, and thus its optical thickness, increases radiative heat loss while also reducing temperature levels. The relative importance of TRI was found to be independent of optical thickness (roughly  $30\%$  for all flames).

While temperature levels in optically thin flames are only weakly dependent on radiation, pollutant levels tend to be a strong function of temperature. Pal et al. [359] used Wang and coworkers' code to investigate NO levels in Sandia D, as shown in Fig. 22- 20. Radiation is seen to decrease NO levels appreciably (due to the slightly lower temperatures). The agreement between experiment and theory is rather encouraging, and Fig. 22- 20 clearly demonstrates the importance of radiation and TRI on mean pollutant levels and their turbulent fluctuations: Radiation lowers temperatures in the center of the flame (lowering NO levels), but heats colder

![](images/f60bde088c71e26ed38101bdc070397f1f969a7ad0c87f994bc20d78d08db191.jpg)  
FIGURE 22-20 Radial profiles of NO mass fraction at various axial locations of Flame D: (a) mean values, (b) RMS fluctuations; from Pal et al. [359].

regions further away (increasing NO). Radiation's "action at a distance" decreases RMS fluctuations everywhere, except for colder regions that have no NO at all without radiation. These effects are multiplied in larger flames, with greater influence of radiation and TRI on temperatures: predicted NO levels decrease by orders of magnitude when radiation and TRI are taken into account.

The first attempt to quantify absorption TRI was made by Tessé and coworkers [360], who investigated a small sooting (luminous) ethylene flame, using detailed chemistry and a sophisticated soot model [361], together with a Lagrangian solver to obtain the composition PDF. They then constructed many homogeneous turbulence structures from this PDF and determined the thermal radiation with a photon Monte Carlo scheme together with the narrow band

$k$ - distribution model of Soufiani and Taine [362]. They found emission to increase by  $30\%$ , and also found absorption TRI to be appreciable (5% of total emission) for this luminous flame, indicating eddies of appreciable optical thickness. The first ones to assess absorption TRI from basic principles (i.e., without the assumptions for turbulence structures made by Tessé) were Wang and coworkers [345], who used a transported composition PDF to determine composition variables and their turbulence moments, together with Wang's [363,364] LBL- accurate photon Monte Carlo scheme for stochastic particles. This radiation solver was specifically developed to determine a PDF for photons, providing full compatibility with the stochastic turbulence model. With their model Wang and coworkers [345] provided proof that absorption TRI is negligible for Sandia D and, indeed, also for large nonluminous flames. The method was further employed to investigate the influence of TRI in sooting flames: Mehta et al. [365- 367] modeled six sooting flames [368- 370] using Wang and coworkers' [345] schemes together with a sophisticated soot model [371], to assess the importance of both emission and absorption TRI in such systems. They found emission TRI (30% to 60%) and heat losses from the flame (increases of 45% to 90%) to be stronger than in nonluminous flames. However, in contrast to Tessé's [360] observations, absorption TRI was found to be negligible for all six laboratory- scale flames, despite the soot. Only when scaling up the sootiest flame [369] by a factor of 32 did absorption TRI become appreciable (6% of total emission).

Turbulence- radiation interactions may also be assessed using more sophisticated CFD methods, such as large eddy simulations (LES) and direct numerical simulations (DNS). Chandy and coworkers [372] were the first to study TRI using LES together with a filtered density function (FDF) for composition variables (the LES equivalent of the transported PDF used with RANS simulations), looking at an idealized luminous flame with a primitive soot model. They concluded that, while emission TRI is always important at the subgrid scale (SGS) level, absorption TRI at the SGS level can always be neglected. Similar conclusions were drawn by Gupta et al. [373], who used a similar LES/FDF approach, but coupled with Wang's [363,364] LBL- accurate photon Monte Carlo scheme. Finally, Roger [374, 375] also showed SGS absorption TRI to be negligible by using DNS of stationary isotropic turbulence. Turbulence- radiation interactions in the context of DNS have been investigated by the group around Haworth and Modest [376- 380] for a number of artificial scenarios. However, to date DNS simulations are limited to system sizes in the mm range, i.e., ranges over which combustion media are optically extremely thin.

Today the study of turbulence- radiation interactions remains an extremely active field of research. For further reading the reader is directed toward several review articles by Modest [381- 383] and the very exhaustive monograph by Coelho [384].

# 22.10 RADIATION IN CONCENTRATING SOLAR ENERGY SYSTEMS

Radiative heat transfer plays an important role in the harnessing of concentrated solar radiation. Applications include solar thermal power [385,386], solar thermochemistry [387- 389], and concentrating photovoltaics [390- 392], in which solar radiation is converted to thermal, chemical, and electrical energy, respectively.

Radiative fluxes that can be obtained with optical concentrators vary between few  $\mathrm{kW} / \mathrm{m}^2$  and several  $\mathrm{MW} / \mathrm{m}^2$ . Concentrating solar systems are characterized by the solar concentration ratio, defined as the ratio of the concentrated solar flux to solar irradiation of  $1\mathrm{kW} / \mathrm{m}^2$ . High temperatures can be achieved by increasing the concentration ratio to limit the reradiation losses from a receiver [393]. While high temperatures are targeted in solar thermal power and thermochemical systems to increase their efficiency, they are unwanted in photovoltaic cells due to cell efficiency decreasing with temperature. Thus, concentrating photovoltaics systems typically utilize lower fluxes and research efforts are focused on cell thermal management [390].

High- temperature solar thermal systems often include solid- gas heterogeneous media at

![](images/b8b3f59452f5a7d1366fdf671819e42100e8298887c9dade16794e83dd5a40c8.jpg)

temperatures exceeding several hundred degrees Celsius, and in some applications reaching more than  $2000^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ . Such media serve multiple purposes. They absorb high- flux irradiation (absorption is predominantly by the solid phase as direct gas absorption is ineffective for length scales of a solar device) and transfer the heat to a working gas in a solar thermal receiver driving a thermodynamic power cycle, and/or to a chemical reaction in a solar thermochemical reactor. In directly irradiated receivers/reactors radiation is absorbed by a solid that is in direct contact with the working gas or provides surface to a chemical reaction, respectively (Fig. 22- 21a). In indirectly irradiated receivers/reactors radiation is absorbed by a solid, and then transferred to a gas or to a chemical reaction by conduction, convection, and/or radiation through an intermediate heat transfer medium (solid, fluid, or multiphase medium, Fig. 22- 21b).

# Radiation in Solar Thermal Receivers

The design of a receiver depends on the type of concentrator, the working fluid, and the operating ranges of temperature, pressure, and radiative flux. A comprehensive review of solar receivers up to 1998 was given by Karni et al. [396], and a more recent review of volumetric receivers for solar thermal power plants with a central receiver by Avila- Marin [397].

An early radiative heat transfer analysis in a volumetric solar absorber was presented by Flamant [398] for solar fluidized beds of silicon carbide, chamotte, zirconia, and silica particles. Temperature profiles, total emissivity, heat flux distribution, and effective mean penetration distance were determined and compared to experimental data. Combined radiative, conductive, and forced convective heat transfer in a volumetric selective solar absorber containing a packed bed of two spectrally dissimilar slabs of particles was analyzed by Flamant et al. [399] using the two- flux approximation. The model accounted for the variation of absorption and scattering of the layers in the visible and infrared spectral ranges, and its predictions were validated experimentally using a bed of glass and silicon carbide particles that were heating the gas phase. An array of irradiated fin- pins exposed to a gas flow was studied experimentally in a solar furnace by Karni et al. [396].

A two- dimensional steady- state heat transfer model coupling radiation, conduction, and convection was developed for a novel design of a high- temperature pressurized- air receiver for power generation via combined Brayton- Rankine cycles (see Fig. 22- 21) [395]. The model employs separate energy equations for solid and gas phases in the annular layer of reticulated

![](images/795cfb32abfa6a2e280300a83a3900a9ad4811c8530b2ad18fa9e4f5c305aaa6.jpg)  
FIGURE 22-22 Radial distribution of radiative source term within the RPC of the receiver shown in Fig. 22-21b, at a selected axial location  $z / L = 0.12$  (for receiver length of  $65\mathrm{mm}$ , outer radius of SiC tube of  $20\mathrm{mm}$ , and a total solar power input of  $1\mathrm{kW}$ ) [395].

porous ceramics saturated with pressurized air:

$$

where  $s$  is the specific surface area of the solid- fluid interface and  $h$  is the heat transfer coefficient between particles and air. Radiative transfer in the receiver cavity was modeled using enclosure theory. The Rosseland diffusion approximation, the  $P_{1}$ - approximation and the Monte Carlo method were employed as alternative methods to study radiative transfer in the porous layer, which was assumed to be gray and isotropically scattering:

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathrm{diffusion,equation}(15.16):}\\ & {P_1,\mathrm{equation}(16.50a):}\\ & {\mathrm{Monte Carlo,equation}(21.45):} \end{array} \begin{array}{rl} & {\dot{Q}_R^{\prime \prime \prime} = \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r - \frac{16\sigma T_s^3}{3p}\frac{\partial T_s}{\partial r}\right),}\\ & {\dot{Q}_R^{\prime \prime \prime} = \kappa (G - 4\sigma T_s^4),}\\ & {\dot{Q}_R^{\prime \prime \prime} = \frac{\delta Q_a}{\delta V} -4\kappa \sigma T_s^4,} \end{array} \tag{22.100b}
$$

where the radiative power  $\delta Q_{a}$  absorbed by the volume  $\delta V$  is directly computed by the Monte Carlo method. Figure 22- 22 shows the radial distributions of the radiative source term for the three solution methods at a selected location  $z / L = 0.12$ . The  $P_{1}$  results were found to agree reasonably well with those obtained by the Monte Carlo method, while the Rosseland approximation led to inaccurate results due to the relatively small optical thickness of the porous layer made of reticulated porous ceramics  $(\tau_{\mathrm{RPC}} = 3)$ .  $P_{1}$  was found to be the most appropriate method as it simultaneously led to good accuracy and short computational times. A combined heat transfer numerical study using the discrete ordinate method for a solid- particle receiver was presented in [400].

Cavity- receivers are often enclosed by semitransparent windows to separate the hot gas inside the receiver from a cold ambient atmosphere. Radiative heat transfer in a cavity- receiver containing a windowed aperture was analyzed by Maag et al. [401] for quartz and sapphire windows using the band approximation of Chapter 7. Radiative heat transfer in a solar cavity receiver with a plano- convex window was studied by Yong et al. [402] with the Monte Carlo method.

# Radiation in Solar Thermochemical Reactors

The use of concentrated solar radiation in chemistry dates back to the 18th century, when Antoine Lavoisier conducted combustion experiments in a solar furnace consisting of two

concentric lenses [403]. Pioneering work on solar processes and reactors was done by Trombe and Foex [404], Nakamura [405], Fletcher and Moen [393], and others. In a solar thermochemical reactor the incident solar radiation enters a reactor cavity through an aperture, which may be windowed, and is absorbed by reactants and cavity walls. Reactor design and optimization is typically guided by thermochemical models coupling radiation, conduction, and convection to the chemical kinetics [406]. Radiation analyses range from models with surface radiative exchange to more sophisticated models, in which medium composition and phases vary with time as chemical reactions progress.

Solar- driven redox thermochemical cycles have been investigated to produce  $\mathrm{H}_{2}$  and CO from  $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}$  and  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ , respectively. A two- step cycle for a generic metal oxide  $\mathrm{M}_x\mathrm{O}_y$  can be written as [407]:

$$
\mathrm{solar,endothermic step:}\qquad \frac{1}{\Delta\delta}\mathrm{M}_x\mathrm{O}_{y - \delta_{\mathrm{ox}}}\rightarrow \frac{1}{\Delta\delta}\mathrm{M}_x\mathrm{O}_{y - \delta_{\mathrm{red}}} + 0.5\mathrm{O}_2, \tag{22.101}

where  $\delta_{\mathrm{ox}}$  and  $\delta_{\mathrm{red}}$  are the nonstoichiometric coefficients of the reduced and oxidized forms of the metal oxide, and  $\Delta \delta = \delta_{\mathrm{red}} - \delta_{\mathrm{ox}}$ . Lipinski et al. [408] studied the decomposition of micrometer- sized zinc oxide particles in a stationary particle suspension under direct high- flux irradiation. A numerical model coupling transient radiative heat transfer to chemical kinetics accounted for time- dependent radiative properties due to decreasing particle sizes, computed from Mie theory at each time step of the transient solution. Abanades et al. [409] developed a multiphase model coupling fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, and chemical kinetics of the zinc oxide decomposition reaction, treating the particles as opaque spheres. Transient radiative heat transfer in directly irradiated solar reactors containing packed beds of zinc oxide particles was numerically analyzed using the Rosseland diffusion approximation by Müller et al. [410] and Schunk and coworkers [411]. A diffusion- based model of internal radiative transport in the packed bed of zinc oxide was also proposed by Dombrovsky et al. [412]. The numerically determined temperature profiles reported in [411, 412] were found to be in good agreement with those measured in a solar- driven thermogravimeter. Radiative heat transfer in a solar thermochemical reactor for the reduction of cerium dioxide was analyzed using the Monte Carlo method by Villafán- Vidales et al. [413]. The participating medium was a nonisothermal, nongray, absorbing, emitting, and anisotropically scattering suspension of particles with properties obtained from Mie theory. Radiative characteristics of novel cerium dioxide- based materials for applications in nonstoichiometric redox cycles were studied by Liang et al. [414], Ganesan et al. [415, 416], and Haussener and Steinfeld [417].

Directly irradiated particles of carbonaceous materials are encountered in several solar thermochemical processes including steam gasification of coal and methane decomposition,

$$
\mathrm{CH}_x\mathrm{O}_{1 - y} + y\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O} = (x / 2 + y)\mathrm{H}_2 + \mathrm{CO}, \tag{22.104}
$$

$$
\mathrm{CH}_4\rightarrow \mathrm{C} + 2\mathrm{H}_2. \tag{22.105}
$$

Transient radiative heat transfer in directly irradiated stationary suspensions of coal particles undergoing steam gasification was studied numerically using the Monte Carlo method and Mie theory by Lipinski and Steinfeld [418] and geometric optics by Lipinski et al. [419]. The Monte Carlo method and geometric optics were also applied in a simulation of a solid- gas fluidized bed reactor for coal gasification. Maag and coworkers [394] developed a transient combined convective- radiative heat transfer model of directly irradiated  $\mathrm{CH}_4$  flow laden with carbon particles. Mie theory was applied to obtain radiative properties of particles growing due to deposition of carbon from the decomposition reaction. A combined radiative- conductive- convective heat transfer model of an entrained- flow reactor for methane decomposition was

developed by Maag et al. [420]. The net radiation method was applied to a cavity with opaque walls and a semi- transparent aperture.

Thermal decomposition of calcium carbonate has been studied for the solar production of lime and cement, as well as solar thermochemical  $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$  capture. In these models for reacting packed beds  $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$  particles were assumed to be in the size range of geometric optics. The Rosseland diffusion approximation was applied in a transient combined radiation- conduction model [421], while spectral characteristics of the refracting and absorbing semitransparent particles were accounted for in another study [422].

# Problems

22.1 A vat of molten glass is heated from below by a gray, diffuse surface with  $T = 1800\mathrm{K}$  and  $\epsilon = 0.8$ . The glass layer is  $1\mathrm{m}$  thick, and its top is exposed to free convection and radiation with an ambient space at  $1000\mathrm{K}$  (heat transfer coefficient for free convection  $= 5\mathrm{W / m^2K}$ ). Neglecting convection within the melt, estimate the temperature distribution within the glass, using the radiative properties of glass as given in Figs. 1-17 and 3-16. What is the total heat loss from the bottom surface?

22.2 Estimate the total heat flux for Problem 22.1, as well as the glass- air interface temperature, by using the additive solution method.

22.3 A glass sphere  $(D = 4\mathrm{cm})$  initially at uniform temperature  $T_{i} = 300\mathrm{K}$  is placed into a furnace, whose walls and inert gas are at a uniform  $T_{2} = T_{\mathrm{m}} = 1500\mathrm{K}$ . Assuming the glass to be gray and nonscattering  $(\kappa = 1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}, n = 1.5, k = 1.5\mathrm{W / mK})$  and a sphere/furnace gas heat transfer coefficient of  $10\mathrm{W / m^2K}$ , determine the sphere's temperature distribution as a function of time.

22.4 A  $1\mathrm{cm}$  thick quartz window (assumed gray with  $\kappa = 1\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  and  $n = 1.5$ ) forms the barrier between a furnace and the ambient, resulting in face temperatures of  $T_{1} = 800\mathrm{K}$  and  $T_{2} = 400\mathrm{K}$ . Estimate the conductive, radiative, and total heat fluxes passing through the window  $(k = 1.5\mathrm{W / mK})$ .

22.5 Repeat Problem 5.36 for the case in which a gray, isotropically scattering, stationary gas  $(\kappa = 2\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}, k = 0.04\mathrm{W / mK})$  is filling the  $1\mathrm{cm}$  thick gap between surface and shield.

22.6 A sheet of ice  $20\mathrm{cm}$  thick is lying on top of black soil. Initially, ice and soil are at  $- 10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  when the sun begins to shine, hitting the top of the ice with a strength of  $800\mathrm{W / m^2}$  (normal to the rays), at an off- normal angle of  $30^{\circ}$ . Assume the ground to be insulated, ice and water to have constant and equal

properties  $(k, \rho , c_{p})$ , a gray absorption coefficient (for solar light) of  $\kappa \simeq 1 \mathrm{~cm}^{- 1}$ , and a gray reflectance of 0.02. Neglecting emission from and scattering by the ice, as well as convection losses/gains at the surface, determine the transient temperature distribution within the ice/water until the time when all ice has melted.

22.7 Consider a gray medium separating an axle from its bearing. The gap is so narrow that the movement between axle and bearing may be approximated by Couette flow (two infinite parallel plates, one stationary, and the other moving at constant velocity  $U$ ). The movement is so rapid that viscous dissipation must be considered  $[\Phi = (\partial u / \partial y)^2$ , where  $u = u(y)$  is the velocity at a distance  $y$  from the lower, stationary plate\]. The medium is gray and nonscattering with a constant absorption coefficient, and both surfaces are isothermal (at different temperatures) and gray- diffuse. Set up the necessary equations and boundary conditions to calculate the net heat transfer rates on the two surfaces.

22.8 Consider a solar water heater as shown in the adjacent sketch. A  $5 \mathrm{~mm}$  thick layer of water is flowing down a black, insulated plate as shown while exposed to sunshine. The water is seeded with a fine powder that gives it a gray absorption coefficient of  $\kappa = 5 \mathrm{~cm}^{- 1}$ . The top of the water layer loses heat by free convection  $(h = 10 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2} \mathrm{~K})$  to the ambient at  $T_{\mathrm{amb}} = 300 \mathrm{~K}$ . At the top of the collector  $(x = 0)$  the water enters at a uniform temperature of  $T_{0} = 300 \mathrm{~K}$ . The velocity profile may be considered fully developed everywhere. Determine the cumulative collected solar energy as a function of  $x$ .

22.9 Consider a gas- particulate mixture flowing through an isothermal tube  $(v_{w} = 1, T_{w} = 400 \mathrm{~K})$ . The gas is radiatively nonparticipating and has constant velocity  $u$  across the tube cross- section such that  $\mathrm{Pe} = \mathrm{Re} \mathrm{Pr} = uD / \alpha = 30,000$ . The particles are very small, gray, and uniformly distributed such that  $\kappa_{p} R = 5$  (no scattering) and  $(\bar{u} \bar{v}_{\mathrm{p}} c_{\mathrm{p}})_{\mathrm{vis}} = \bar{u} \bar{v}_{\mathrm{p}} c_{\mathrm{p}})_{\mathrm{bg}} = 2$ . The particles are so small that they are essentially at the same temperature as the gas surrounding them. Using the diffusion approximation for the radiative heat transfer, set up the relevant equations and boundary conditions for the calculation of local bulk temperature and local total heat flux. Obtain a numerical solution (after neglecting axial conduction and radiation), and compare with Figs. 22- 13 and 22- 14.

# CHAPTER 23

# INVERSE RADIATIVE HEAT TRANSFER

# 23.1 INTRODUCTION

Up to this point we have concerned ourselves with radiative heat transfer problems, where the necessary geometry, temperatures, and radiative properties are known, enabling us to calculate the radiative intensity and radiative heat fluxes in such enclosures. Such cases are sometimes called "direct" heat transfer problems. However, there are many important engineering applications where knowledge of one or more input parameters is desired that cause a certain radiative intensity field. For example, it may be desired to control the temperatures of heating elements in a furnace, in order to achieve a specified temperature distribution or radiative heat load on an object being heated. Or the aim may be to deduce difficult to measure parameters (such as radiative properties, temperature fields inside a furnace, etc.) based on measurements of radiative intensity or radiative flux. Such calculations are known as inverse heat transfer analyses.

One of the difficulties associated with inverse heat transfer analyses is the fact that they tend to be ill- posed (unlike direct heat transfer problems, which are nearly always well- posed). The conditions for a problem to be well- posed were first postulated by Hadamard [1] as the solution to the problem must exist, the solution must be unique, and the solution must be stable (i.e., small changes of problem parameters cause only small changes in the solution).

Only in rare instances can the solution to an inverse problem be proven to be unique. For example, while a given parameter field will produce, say, a unique radiative flux at a given location (direct problem), the measured radiative flux at a certain location, on the other hand, can be caused by various parameter fields governing the system (inverse problem). Moreover, inverse problems tend to be very sensitive to disturbances in the parameter field, such as random errors attached to experimental data. This generally necessitates special solution techniques to satisfy stability requirements, by adding additional information to the analysis based on prior knowledge of the true (or desired, in the case of design) solution attributes.

While rudimentary attempts at inverse heat transfer solutions have been around for many years, formal methods to convert unstable inverse problems into approximate, well- posed problems through different types of regularization or stabilization techniques are only 40 to 50 years old, notably Tikhonov's regularization procedure [2], and Beck's function estimation technique [3]. The earliest works on inverse heat transfer problems date back to about 1960 [4- 8], all on inverse heat conduction. The first investigations on inverse radiative heat transfer appeared in the early 1990s, mostly by Ozisik and coworkers [9- 16]. Interestingly, almost all

of these papers concerned themselves with radiative transfer within participating media, and there were only a few treatments dealing with inverse surface radiation before the turn of the century [17, 18].

The last decade has seen a veritable explosion in research on inverse radiation, which will be summarized after a brief outline is given of the nature of inverse radiation problems, and after some of the more basic and popular solution methods are explained. The reader interested in conducting serious research in this field should consult the various books on inverse heat transfer [19- 24] and solution methods for ill- posed problems [2,3,25- 32]. Reviews of inverse radiation tools and research have been given by França and coworkers [33] and Daun and Howell [34, 35] (inverse surface radiation problems), and by Charette et al. [36] (optical tomography).

# 23.2 SOLUTION METHODS

The solution to an inverse problem is usually found by minimizing an objective function,  $F$ , using a stabilization technique in the minimization procedure. We will here briefly discuss a few of the most popular methods, such as the truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), Tikhonov regularization, Newton's method, and the Levenberg- Marquardt and conjugate gradient techniques.

Suppose the radiative intensity or radiative flux, etc., is known for a number of directions, and/or wavelengths. These measured data values (for deducing parameters inside or on the surface of the radiative enclosure) or desired values (for control of parameters) will be denoted by the data vector  $\mathbf{y}$  (with elements  $Y_{1}, Y_{2}, \ldots , Y_{I}$ ). These data need to be compared with corresponding values estimated from a direct analysis, based on an optimized set of the unknown parameters to be determined, denoted by the vector  $\mathbf{i}$  (with elements  $I_{1}, I_{2}, \ldots , I_{I}$ ).

If  $J$  different parameters are chosen for the inverse problem, these values form a parameter vector  $\mathbf{p}$  (with elements  $p_{1}, p_{2}, \ldots , p_{J}$ ), and the estimated solutions  $I_{i}$  are a function of this vector. For example, if it is desired to estimate the Planck function (or temperature) distribution within a participating medium, one may postulate the Planck function field to be approximated by

$$
I_{b\eta}(\mathbf{r},\eta)\simeq \sum_{j = 1}^{J}p_{j}f_{j}(\mathbf{r},\eta), \tag{23.1}
$$

where the  $f_{j}$  are known specified basis functions (polynomials, splines, etc.), and the best values for the  $p_{j}$  are to be found.

If all the data points have statistically equal error values, or if all desired values have equal importance, then the objective function to be minimized is the ordinary least squares norm:

$$
F = \sum_{i = 1}^{J}(I_{i} - Y_{i})^{2} = (\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{y})\cdot (\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{y}) = \left\| \mathbf{i} - \mathbf{y}\right\|^{2}. \tag{23.2}
$$

If the data points are very close together then the summation in equation (23.2) may be replaced by an integral.

In many applications the statistical uncertainty of data points, or their variance,  $\sigma_{i}^{2}$ , may be known and may be different for individual data points. In that case it is preferable to define the objective function as a weighted least squares norm

$$
F = \sum_{i = 1}^{J}\left(\frac{I_i - Y_i}{\sigma_i}\right)^2 = (\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{y})\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot (\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{y}), \tag{23.3}
$$

where  $\mathbf{W}$  is a diagonal weighting matrix,

$$
W = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}{1 / \sigma_1^2} & 0 & \dots & 0\\ {0} & {1 / \sigma_2^2} & \dots & 0\\ {\vdots} & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ {0} & 0 & & {1 / \sigma_I^2} \end{array} \right). \tag{23.4}
$$

In control applications, where  $\mathbf{y}$  is the desired effect, rather than a vector of measured data, the factors  $1 / \sigma_{i}$  function as importance factors attached to individual control values  $Y_{j}$ . Equation (23.3) reduces to equation (23.2) if  $\mathbf{W}$  is equal to the unity tensor  $\delta$  (with Kronecker's delta function  $\delta_{ij}$  as elements, i.e., a diagonal matrix with all nondiagonal elements zero, and all diagonal elements  $W_{ii} = 1$ ).

Minimization of the objective function in terms of the parameter vector  $\mathbf{p}$  requires that the derivatives of  $F$  with respect to each of the parameters  $p_j$  be zero, i.e.,

$$
\frac{\partial F}{\partial p_1} = \frac{\partial F}{\partial p_2} = \dots = \frac{\partial F}{\partial p_J} = 0, \text{or} \nabla_p F(\mathbf{p}) = \mathbf{0}, \tag{23.5}
$$

where the  $\nabla_p F(\mathbf{p})$  represents the gradient of  $F(\mathbf{p})$  with respect to the vector of parameters. Carrying out the differentiation of equation (23.3) with respect to  $\mathbf{p}$  leads to

$$
\frac{\partial F}{\partial p_j} = 2 \sum_{i = 1}^{J} \frac{I_i - Y_i}{\sigma_i^2} \frac{\partial I_i}{\partial p_j} = 0, \quad j = 1, 2, \ldots , J, \tag{23.6}
$$

or, in matrix notation,

$$
\nabla_{p}F(\mathbf{p}) = 2(\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{y})\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{0}, \tag{23.7}
$$

where  $\mathbf{X}$  is known as the sensitivity matrix, or Jacobian, with elements

$$
\mathbf{X} = \nabla_{p}\mathbf{i} = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}\frac{\partial I_{1}}{\partial p_{1}} & \frac{\partial I_{1}}{\partial p_{2}} & \dots & \frac{\partial I_{1}}{\partial p_{J}} \\ \frac{\partial I_{2}}{\partial p_{1}} & \frac{\partial I_{2}}{\partial p_{2}} & \dots & \frac{\partial I_{2}}{\partial p_{J}} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \frac{\partial I_{I}}{\partial p_{1}} & \frac{\partial I_{I}}{\partial p_{2}} & \dots & \frac{\partial I_{I}}{\partial p_{J}} \end{array} \right), \tag{23.8}
$$

for  $J$  unknown parameters and  $I$  measured (or defined) data points. If the sensitivity matrix is independent of  $\mathbf{p}$  the problem is called linear. For example, if the general radiative transfer equation (10.21) is to be solved with the temperature field given by equation (23.1) (and there are no other unknown parameters), differentiation of the intensity field with respect to any parameter  $p_j$  makes  $\frac{\partial I}{\partial p_j}$  independent of all parameters  $\mathbf{p}$ . For such a case

$$
\mathbf{i} = \mathbf{X}\cdot \mathbf{p} \tag{23.9}
$$

and equation (23.7) may be restated in standard matrix form as

$$
\mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{b}, \quad \text{with} \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{X}^T\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{X}, \mathbf{b} = \mathbf{X}^T\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{y}, \tag{23.10}
$$

which are known as the normal equations, and are solved after matrix inversion as

$$
\mathbf{p} = \mathbf{A}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{b} = (\mathbf{X}^T\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{X})^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{X}^T\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{y}. \tag{23.11}
$$

If the problem is nonlinear, i.e., the sensitivity coefficients  $X_{ij}$  are functions of  $\mathbf{p}$ , then the problem must be linearized and solved iteratively. This is usually done by expanding  $\mathbf{i}(\mathbf{p})$  into a truncated Taylor series around the current solution  $\mathbf{p}^k$  at iteration  $k$ , or

$$
\mathbf{i}(\mathbf{p})\simeq \mathbf{i}(\mathbf{p}^k) + \mathbf{X}^k\cdot (\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{p}^k), \tag{23.12}
$$

where  $\mathbf{i}(\mathbf{p}^k)$  and  $\mathbf{X}^k$  are the values for estimated intensity and the sensitivity matrix after the  $k$ th iteration. Sticking this into equation (23.7) leads to an iterative procedure with updated parameter vector as

$$
\mathbf{p}^{k + 1} = \mathbf{p}^k +(\mathbf{X}^{Tk}\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{X}^{k})^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{X}^{Tk}\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{i}^k), \tag{23.13}
$$

which is known as the Gauss (or Gauss- Newton) method.

The linear solution, equation (23.11), and the linearized iterative procedure, equation (23.13), both require the matrix  $\mathbf{X}^T\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{X}$  to be nonsingular, i.e., its determinant may not be zero, or  $\left|\mathbf{X}^T\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{X}\right|\neq 0$ . If the value of this determinant is close to zero the problem is called ill- conditioned and, unfortunately, inverse heat transfer problems tend to be very ill- conditioned. This is best understood by visually comparing the solutions to two very simple well- conditioned and ill- conditioned matrix equations, such as

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathrm{well - conditioned:}\qquad \mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{p} = \left( \begin{array}{ll}2 & 3\\ 3 & 3 \end{array} \right)\cdot \left( \begin{array}{l}p_{1}\\ p_{2} \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array}{l}1\\ 1 \end{array} \right) = \mathbf{b},}\\ & {\mathrm{ill - conditioned:}\qquad \mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{p} = \left( \begin{array}{ll}2 & 2.1\\ 2 & 2 \end{array} \right)\cdot \left( \begin{array}{l}p_{1}\\ p_{2} \end{array} \right) = \left( \begin{array}{l}1\\ 1 \end{array} \right) = \mathbf{b}.} \end{array} \tag{23.14b}
$$

The well- conditioned matrix equation has a well- defined solution  $\begin{array}{r}p_{1} = p_{2} = \frac{1}{5} \end{array}$  in the present case), which minimizes the square residual

$$
\| \mathbf{A}\cdot \mathbf{p} - \mathbf{b}\| ^2 = \sum_{i = 1}^{2}\left(\sum_{j = 1}^{2}A_{ij}p_j - b_i\right)^2, \tag{23.15}
$$

as shown in a contour plot in Fig. 23- 1a. Equation (23.14b) also has a single, unique solution (as is guaranteed for all nonsingular linear problems, with  $p_1 = \frac{1}{2}$ ,  $p_2 = 0$  in this particular case), but, as seen from the contour plot in Fig. 23- 1b, there is also a range of locations along the valley floor that makes the residual very small. In control problems this leads to many

![](images/914f37c84e036ac1f18362647c9efeed8a1e28f8a6475c7a138b57a99682e44e.jpg)  
FIGURE 23-2 Geometry for Example 23.1.

possible solutions, which almost satisfy the design criteria (but may require undesirable control parameters). Similarly, when trying to deduce a property field, many solutions exist that nearly satisfy the experimental data (but may yield property fields with wide fluctuations). In addition, ill- conditionedness makes the solution highly susceptible to small perturbations in experimental data as well as to numerical artifacts, such as roundoff error.

Before discussing methods to solve ill- conditioned problems it is instructive to investigate the matrices that need to be inverted in the analysis, such as  $\mathbf{X}$  in equation (23.9) or  $\mathbf{X}^T\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{X}$  in equation (23.10). The properties of an arbitrary matrix  $\mathbf{A}$  with  $M\times N$  elements may be diagnosed through Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [30,37], by decomposing it into a product of an  $M\times N$  column- orthogonal matrix  $\mathbf{U}$ , an  $N\times N$  diagonal matrix  $\mathbf{S}$  with only positive or zero elements (its singular values, usually placed in descending order), and the transpose of an  $N\times N$  orthogonal matrix  $\mathbf{V}^T$ , i.e.,  $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{U}\cdot \mathbf{S}\cdot \mathbf{V}^T$ . The beauty of orthogonal matrices is that its inverse is simply its transpose, while the inverse of a diagonal matrix (i.e., a matrix where only the diagonal terms are nonzero) is another diagonal matrix whose elements are the reciprocals of  $S_{kk}$ . Therefore, the inverse of  $\mathbf{A}$  follows as

$$
\mathbf{A}^{-1} = \mathbf{V}\cdot \mathbf{S}^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{U}^{T}, \tag{23.16a}
$$

which has elements

$$
(A^{-1})_{ij} = \sum_{k = 1}^{N}V_{ik}\frac{1}{S_{kk}} U_{jk}. \tag{23.16b}
$$

Inspection of equation (23.16b) shows that the only thing that can go wrong with the inversion of (a nonsingular)  $\mathbf{A}$  is that the inversion gets greatly impacted by roundoff error caused by very small singular values. The condition number of a matrix is the ratio of the largest over the smallest  $S_{kk}$ ; the matrix is singular if the condition number is infinite, and is ill- conditioned if its condition number is too large.

Example 23.1. Consider two long parallel plates of width  $w$  as shown in Fig. 23- 2. Both plates have a gray, diffuse emittance of  $\epsilon$ , they are separated by a distance  $h$  and are placed in a large, cold environment. The bottom plate is insulated, and it is desired to keep this plate at an isothermal temperature  $T^*$  across its width through radiative heating from the top plate. Determine the necessary temperature distribution  $T_{2}(x_{2})$  to achieve this result.

# Solution

Direct Solution. From equation (5.27) we find that  $J_{1}(x_{1}) = \sigma T_{1}^{4}(x_{1})$  for an insulated surface. Thus, from equation (5.24), with  $dF_{di - d\bar{t}} = 0$ , we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{l}\sigma T_1^4 (x_1) = \int_0^w J_2(x_2)dF_{d1 - d2},\\ J_2(x_2) = \epsilon \sigma T_2^4 (x_2) + (1 - \epsilon)\int_0^w\sigma T_1^4 dF_{d2 - d1}. \end{array}
$$

The necessary view factors have already been obtained in Example 5.10. Also, using similar nondimensionalization as in that example, i.e.,  $W = w / h$ ,  $\xi = x / h$ ,  $\Theta (x) = [T(x) / T^* ]^4$ , and  $\mathcal{J}(\xi_2) = J_2(x_2) / \sigma T^* 4$ ,

these equations become

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\Theta_{1}(\xi_{1}) = \int_{0}^{W}\mathcal{J}(\xi_{2})f(\xi_{1} - \xi_{2})d\xi_{2},}\\ {\mathcal{J}(\xi_{2}) = \epsilon \Theta_{2}(\xi_{2}) + (1 - \epsilon)\int_{0}^{W}\Theta_{1}(\xi_{1})f(\xi_{1} - \xi_{2})d\xi_{1},}\\ {f(\xi_{1} - \xi_{2}) = \frac{1}{2}\left[1 + (\xi_{1} - \xi_{2})^{2}\right]^{-3 / 2}.} \end{array}
$$

The desired result is  $\Theta_{1}(\xi_{1}) = 1 = \mathrm{const},$  for which the necessary  $\Theta_{2}(\xi_{2})$  needs to be found. We will approximate both plates by  $N$  constant temperature (and radiosity) strips of width  $\Delta \xi = W / N$  that have nondimensional temperatures  $\Theta_{1i},\Theta_{2i},i = 1,2,\ldots ,N,$  with optimum values of the parameters  $\Theta_{2i}$  to be determined (and, for illustrative purposes, without taking advantage of the obvious symmetry across  $x = w / 2)$  . Thus, approximating the integrals by summation over the strips, and assuming view factors to be constant across the width of a strip [evaluated between  $\xi_{1i} = (i - \frac{1}{2})\Delta \xi$  and  $\xi_{2j} = (j - \frac{1}{2})\Delta \xi ],$  we obtain

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl}\Theta_{1i} = \Delta \xi \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\mathcal{J}_jf_{ij}, & & i = 1,2,\ldots ,N,\\ \mathcal{J}_j = \epsilon \Theta_{2j} + (1 - \epsilon)\Delta \xi \sum_{k = 1}^{N}\Theta_{1k}f_{jk}, & & j = 1,2,\ldots ,N, \end{array}
$$

or

$$
\begin{array}{l l}{{\Theta_{1i}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\Theta_{2j}y_{i j}+\sum_{k=1}^{N}\Theta_{1k}z_{i k},}}&{{\quad i=1,2,\ldots,N,}}\\ {{y_{i j}=\epsilon\Delta\xi f_{i j},}}&{{}}\\ {{z_{i k}=(1-\epsilon)\Delta\xi^{2}\sum_{j=1}^{N}f_{i j}f_{j k}.}}\end{array} \tag{23.17}
$$

Inverse Problem. Since we have chosen equal numbers of strips on the bottom surface (design points) and top heater (parameter vector  $\mathbf{p}$  ), equation (23.17) constitutes a set of linear equations (with given desired  $\Theta_{1i}$  ) that can be solved directly for the  $N$  unknown  $\Theta_{2j},$  i.e., by direct solution of equation (23.9). In general, however, the number of strips may be different for each plate and we prefer to minimize the objective function. Since we want each design point to achieve  $T_{1} = T^{*}$  (or  $\Theta_{1} = 1$  ), the objective function becomes, assuming constant weights  $(\sigma_{i} = 1)$

$$
F = \| \Theta_{1} - 1\|^{2} = \sum_{i = 1}^{N}(\Theta_{1i} - 1)^{2},
$$

where 1 is a unity vector (all elements equal 1). The sensitivity matrix is obtained by differentiating equation (23.17) with respect to  $(p_j) = \Theta_{2j},$  or

$$
X_{ij} = y_{ij} + \sum_{k = 1}^{J}z_{ik}X_{ki},
$$

which is solved by successive approximation. We note that the sensitivity matrix is independent of  $\Theta_{2j}$  Thus, the problem is linear (as we noticed already). For a direct solution, and to diagnose the problem's ill- posedness, we perform an SVD on the matrix  $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{X}^T\cdot \mathbf{X}$  Once the  $\mathbf{U},\mathbf{S},$  and  $\mathbf{V}$  matrices have been determined the solution for  $\mathbf{p}$  (with elements  $p_i = \Theta_{2i}$  ) is found from equations (23.10) and (23.16b) as

$$
\Theta_{2i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}(A)_{ij}^{-1}b_{j} = \sum_{k = 1}^{N}\frac{V_{ik}}{S_{kk}}\sum_{j = 1}^{N}U_{jk}b_{j}, \tag{23.18a}
$$

with

$$
\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{X}^T\cdot \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{X}^T\cdot \mathbf{1},\quad \mathrm{or}\quad b_j = \sum_{l = 1}^{N}X_{lj}y_l = \sum_{l = 1}^{N}X_{lj}. \tag{23.18b}
$$

FIGURE 23-3 Singular values for the matrix in Example 23.1.

The singular values for the present problem, with  $w / h = 5$ ,  $\epsilon = 0.5$ , and  $N = 20$  (as calculated with the Numerical Recipes routine swdcmp [37]) are shown in Fig. 23- 3. It can be seen that the singular values decay rapidly from a maximum value of 0.44 down to  $3 \times 10^{- 10}$ , with a condition number exceeding  $10^{9}$ , making the problem very ill- conditioned. The solution to equation (23.18a), when calculated in single precision (with about six digits of accuracy) yields oscillatory (and meaningless) values for nondimensional heater emissive power  $\Theta_{2}$  varying between approximately  $- 300$  and  $+300$  (not shown here).

The matrix  $\mathbf{A}$  in equation (23.10) contains the square of the sensitivity matrix  $\mathbf{X}$ , and thus also the square of its condition number, making the solution even more susceptible to round- off error. An alternative, and often preferred, technique involves solving a truncated version of equation (23.7), by setting

$$
\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{y} = \mathbf{0},\quad \mathrm{or}\quad \mathbf{X}\cdot \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{y}, \tag{23.19}
$$

which also finds a (different) least- squares minimum [37]. However, equation (23.19) is overdeterminate if there are more data points than parameters  $(I > J)$ .

From the above example it can be seen that it is generally necessary to apply stabilizing methods even to the solution of linear inverse problems, such as the techniques discussed below. The various techniques to solve ill- conditioned problems may be loosely collected under the titles regularization, gradient- based optimization, and metaheuristics, and some of the most common methods will be briefly discussed below. More detail can be found in books on the subject, e.g., Hansen [30], as well as several review articles [33,34]

# 23.3 REGULARIZATION

We saw in the previous section that an ill- conditioned matrix has a large condition number, i.e., some of the singular values are very small, causing the solution to become unstable. Decreasing the condition number of a matrix  $\mathbf{A}$  by modifying it (or its inverse) is known as regularization. We will briefly describe here the simple truncated singular value decomposition and the perhaps most popular Tikhonov regularization methods.

# Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD)

The simplest form of regularization consists of simply omitting parts of the inverse of  $\mathbf{A}$  corresponding to the (offending) smallest singular values. This is justified by the fact that the higher terms in the series correspond to "high frequency" components, and often have less physical significance. Our prior knowledge (or desire) of a smooth solution is used as justification for

FIGURE 23-4 Predicted top surface temperatures and recovery of desired bottom surface temperatures for Example 23.2.

truncation [30]. The matrix  $\mathbf{A}$ , as given in the normal equation set (23.10), is first singular value decomposed as given by equation (23.16b). The full solution to equation (23.10) would then be obtained from equation (23.18a). Eliminating the largest values of  $1 / S_{kk}$  is achieved by keeping only the first  $K$  terms in equation (23.18a) (i.e., dropping terms with  $k > K$ , thereby decreasing the condition number)

$$
p_{i}^{*} = \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\frac{V_{ik}}{S_{kk}}\sum_{j = 1}^{N}U_{jk}b_{j},\quad i = 1,\ldots ,N, \tag{23.20}
$$

where  $\mathbf{p}^{*}$  is the regularized solution. The proper value for  $K$  must be determined through external, often subjective criteria. Large values of  $K$  force the result vector  $\mathbf{i}$  (e.g., the achieved nondimensional temperature of the bottom plate in Example 23.1) to more closely follow the prescribed data vector  $\mathbf{y}$  (desired temperature), but may result in strongly oscillatory and/or unphysical parameter vectors  $\mathbf{p}$  (power setting on heater plate). Small values of  $K$ , on the other hand, lead to a smooth variation for  $\mathbf{p}$ , but the result vector  $\mathbf{i}$  may depart substantially from the desired value  $\mathbf{y}$ .

Example 23.2. Repeat the control problem Example 23.1 using truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD).

# Solution

The solution proceeds exactly as in Example 23.1, but the series in equation (23.18a) is truncated to give nondimensional heater temperatures as

$$
\Theta_{2i} = \sum_{k = 1}^{K}\frac{V_{ik}}{S_{kk}}\sum_{j = 1}^{N}U_{jk}b_{j},
$$

and the resulting design surface temperatures are found from equation (23.9)

$$
\Theta_{1i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}X_{ij}\Theta_{2j}.
$$

Figure 23- 4 shows the results, again for  $w / h = 5$ ,  $\epsilon = 0.5$ , and  $N = 20$  strips on each plate, for several odd values of  $K$  (even values produce essentially identical results as the next lower  $K$  because of symmetry). It is observed that retaining a single singular value  $(K = 1)$  results in a very smooth heater setting, and also a smooth design surface temperature (but departing substantially from the desired value of "1"). Larger values of  $K$  bring the design plate temperatures closer to the desired value (albeit with slight oscillations), but at a cost of oscillatory heater settings. Values of  $K > 7$  result in some strips having negative emissive power (cooling), which would be undesirable at best.

# Tikhonov Regularization

Most regularization methods transform an ill- posed inverse problem into a well- behaved one by adding auxiliary information based on desired or assumed solution characteristics [34, 38]:

$$
F = (\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{y})\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot (\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{y}) + \lambda^{2}\Omega (\mathbf{p}), \tag{23.21}
$$

where  $\Omega (\mathbf{p})$  is an arbitrary (positive) function and  $\lambda$  is the (positive) regularization parameter. One of the earliest and most popular examples is Tikhonov regularization [2], employing  $\Omega =$ $\mathbf{p}\cdot \mathbf{L}\cdot \mathbf{p},$  where  $\mathbf{L}$  is an operator. In the simplest Oth order discrete Tikhonov regularization we have  $\mathbf{L} = \delta$  and  $\Omega = \mathbf{p}\cdot \mathbf{p}$  . Thus, equation (23.10) is changed to

$$
(\mathbf{A} + \lambda \delta)\cdot \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{b},\quad \mathrm{with}\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{X}^T\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{X},\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{X}^T\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{y}, \tag{23.22}
$$

where  $\delta$  is again an Nth order unity tensor. Many different and higher order versions of Tikhonov's regularization exist, and the reader is referred to [32,38]. The regularization parameter determines the smoothness of the solution: a small value of  $\lambda$  implies little regularization, while a large  $\lambda$  prioritizes some presumed information, which in the case of standard Tikhonov forces the solution vector toward zero. Several schemes exist to find an optimal value of  $\lambda$  Numerical Recipes [37] suggests a starting value for  $\lambda$  of

$$
\lambda \simeq \mathrm{Tr}(\mathbf{A}) / N, \tag{23.23}
$$

where  $\mathrm{Tr}$  is the trace of the matrix (sum of the  $N$  diagonal elements), giving both parts in the minimization equal weights. An optimum value for  $\lambda$  is then found by trial and error. More sophisticated schemes include construction of a so- called  $L$  - curve, which leads to a semiquantitative determination of  $\lambda$  [30,39].

Example 23.3. Repeat Example 23.1 using Oth order discrete Tikhonov regularization.

# Solution

As in the previous example we calculate  $\mathbf{A} = \mathbf{X}^T\cdot \mathbf{X}$  and  $\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{X}\cdot \mathbf{1}$  . Before inverting A we modify the matrix to

$$
\mathbf{A}^{*} = \mathbf{A} + \lambda \delta ,\quad \mathrm{or}\quad A_{ij}^{*} = A_{ij} + \lambda \delta_{ij},
$$

i.e., all diagonal elements are incremented by  $\lambda$  which is evaluated as

$$
\lambda = C\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i = 1}^{N}A_{ii},
$$

where  $C$  is a constant whose optimal value is to be found by trial and error. Heater emissive powers  $\Theta_{2}$  and design surface emissive powers  $\Theta_{1}$  are then determined from

$$
\begin{array}{l}\Theta_{2i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}\left(A^{*^{-1}}\right)_{ij}b_{j},\quad b_{j} = \sum_{k = 1}^{N}X_{kj},\\ \Theta_{1i} = \sum_{j = 1}^{N}X_{ij}\Theta_{2j}. \end{array}
$$

Results for Tikhonov regularization are shown in Fig. 23- 5, again for  $w / h = 5$ $\epsilon = 0.5,$  and  $N = 20$  strips on each plate, for five fractional values of  $C = 2^{-(5 - k)}$  , with larger  $C$  implying more regularization. It is seen from the figure that the Numerical Recipes' suggested value  $(C = 1)$  gives a reasonable (perhaps slightly over- regularized) solution with smoothly varying heater values, but with design surface temperatures dropping near the edges of the plate. Smaller values of the regularization parameter lead to somewhat better design surface temperatures, at the cost of stronger heater surface variations. In general, it appears that Tikhonov regularization gives better results than TSVD, at least for the present problem.

# 23.4 GRADIENT-BASED OPTIMIZATION

In optimization the objective function  $F$ , most often using least square norms as given by equations (23.2) or (23.3), is minimized in an iterative process. Iteration is always necessary for nonlinear problems, but may also be employed for linear ones to overcome ill- conditioning, which in optimization manifests itself in the form of a difficult objective function topography having a minimum (or several minima in nonlinear problems) surrounded by a long, shallow valley, as shown in Fig. 23- 1b. Many different optimization schemes have been developed to minimize  $F$ . When  $F$  is continuously differentiable over the feasible region of  $\mathbf{p}$ , it is generally best to use analytically defined search directions, with gradient- based methods being used most often [40]. In all schemes, during each iteration a step of appropriate size is taken along a direction of descent, which is based on the local curvature of the objective function at the previous iteration. Thus, after the  $k$ th iteration a new solution vector is found from

$$
\mathbf{p}^{k + 1} = \mathbf{p}^k +\beta^k\mathbf{d}^k, \tag{23.24}
$$

where  $\beta^k$  is the search step size, and  $\mathbf{d}^k$  is the direction of descent. The main difference between gradient minimization techniques is how the search direction is chosen, which usually is how they got their name. As indicated by Daun and coworkers [40], whose development we will follow here, nearly all of the methods require first- order curvature information as contained in the gradient vector,

$$
\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{p}) = \nabla_pF(\mathbf{p}) = \left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial p_1},\frac{\partial F}{\partial p_2},\dots ,\frac{\partial F}{\partial p_J}\right)^T = 2(\mathbf{i} - \mathbf{y})\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{X}, \tag{23.25}
$$

where equation (23.7) has been invoked. Some methods also use second- order curvature information contained in the Hessian matrix

$$
\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{p}) = \nabla_{p}\nabla_{p}F(\mathbf{p}) = \left( \begin{array}{cccc}\frac{\partial^{2}F}{\partial p_{1}^{2}} & \frac{\partial^{2}F}{\partial p_{1}\partial p_{2}} & \dots & \frac{\partial^{2}F}{\partial p_{1}\partial p_{J}}\\ \frac{\partial^{2}F}{\partial p_{2}\partial p_{1}} & \frac{\partial^{2}F}{\partial p_{2}^{2}} & \dots & \frac{\partial^{2}F}{\partial p_{2}\partial p_{J}}\\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ \frac{\partial^{2}F}{\partial p_{J}\partial p_{1}} & \frac{\partial^{2}F}{\partial p_{J}\partial p_{2}} & \dots & \frac{\partial^{2}F}{\partial p_{J}^{2}} \end{array} \right). \tag{23.26}
$$

Some of the more common gradient minimization techniques are steepest descent, Newton and quasi- Newton methods, the Levenberg- Marquardt method, and conjugate gradient methods. Steepest descent is the simplest, but has a linear or even slower convergence rate and is, therefore, not recommended. The other four are briefly described below.

# Newton's Method

In Newton's method the direction of descent is calculated using both first- and second- order curvature information, by expanding the objective function into a second- order Taylor series. Assuming the desired parameter vector  $\mathbf{p}^*$  is a distance  $\mathbf{s}^k$  away from the latest approximation for  $\mathbf{p}^k$ , i.e.,  $\mathbf{p}^* = \mathbf{p}^k + \mathbf{s}^k$ , the gradient vector of the objective function can be written as a two- term Taylor expansion

$$
\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{p}^{*}) = \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{p}^{k} + \mathbf{s}^{k})\simeq \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{p}^{k}) + \mathbf{s}^{kT}\cdot \mathbf{H}(\mathbf{p}^{k}), \tag{23.27}
$$

which is exact with constant Hessian if the objective function is quadratic (which tends to be approximately true, if  $\mathbf{p}^*$  is reasonably close to  $\mathbf{p}^k$ ). Since  $F$  has a global minimum at  $\mathbf{p}^*$  all elements of the gradient vector  $\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{p}^*)$  are equal to zero, and  $\mathbf{s}^k$  is determined from

$$
\mathbf{s}^k\simeq -\mathbf{H}(\mathbf{p}^k)^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{p}^k). \tag{23.28}
$$

In Newton's method,  $\mathbf{d}^k$  is set equal to  $\mathbf{s}^k$ , which is called Newton's direction (with an implied step size  $\beta^k = 1$ ). While the Hessian matrix is generally not constant near the minimum, using Newton's direction results in much better convergence (typically quadratic), compared with the steepest descent method. However, calculating the Hessian matrix at each iteration tends to require significant extra CPU time, which can make Newton's method actually less efficient than the steepest descent method. Thus, Newton's method should only be used when the second derivatives can be calculated easily.

# The Quasi-Newton Method

The quasi- Newton method avoids calculating the Hessian matrix by approximating it using only first- order curvature data collected at previous iterations. At each iteration, the search direction  $\mathbf{d}^k = \mathbf{s}^k$  is calculated from equation (23.28) with an approximate Hessian  $\mathbf{B}$  as

$$
\mathbf{d}^k = -(\mathbf{B}^k)^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{p}^k). \tag{23.29}
$$

Initially,  $(\mathbf{B}^k)^{- 1}$  is set equal to the identity matrix  $\delta$  (which makes it the search direction for the steepest descent method) times an appropriate step size  $\beta^0$  [usually found from a single- value minimization of  $F(\mathbf{p}^0 - \beta^0 \mathbf{g}^0)$ ]. At each subsequent iteration, the approximation of the Hessian matrix is improved upon by adding an update matrix,  $\mathbf{U}^k$ ,

$$
\mathbf{B}^k = \mathbf{B}^{k - 1} + \mathbf{U}^k, \tag{23.30}
$$

and  $\mathbf{U}^k$  is determined using only values of the objective function and gradient vectors from previous iterations. The most common quasi- Newton scheme is the Broyden- Fletcher- Goldfarb- Shanno (BFGS) scheme [31], in this method, the update matrix is calculated from

$$
\mathbf{U}^k = \frac{\mathbf{z}^k\cdot\mathbf{z}^k}{\mathbf{z}^k\cdot\mathbf{d}^{k - 1}} -\frac{\mathbf{B}^{k - 1}\cdot\mathbf{d}^{k - 1}\cdot\mathbf{d}^{k - 1}\cdot\mathbf{B}^{k - 1}}{\mathbf{d}^{k - 1}\cdot\mathbf{B}^{k - 1}\cdot\mathbf{d}^{k - 1}},\mathrm{where}\mathbf{d}^{k - 1} = \mathbf{p}^k -\mathbf{p}^{k - 1},\mathbf{z}^k = \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{p}^k) - \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{p}^{k - 1}), \tag{23.31a}
$$

or, in expanded notation

$$
U_{ij}^{k} = \frac{z_{i}^{k}z_{j}^{k}}{\sum_{m}z_{m}^{k}d_{m}^{k - 1}} -\frac{\sum_{l}B_{il}^{k - 1}d_{l}^{k - 1}\sum_{p}d_{p}^{k - 1}B_{pj}^{k - 1}}{\sum_{q}\sum_{p}d_{q}^{k - 1}B_{qp}^{k - 1}d_{p}^{k - 1}} \tag{23.31b}
$$

Since it takes a few iterations for  $\mathbf{B}$  to accurately approximate the Hessian matrix, the convergence rate of the quasi- Newton scheme is less than the Newton's method, requiring a few more iterations to find the global minimum for  $F$ . However, since no second derivatives are needed, the quasi- Newton scheme is usually computationally more efficient.

We will here illustrate the method by presenting a very simple example, this time a problem to infer radiative properties of a participating medium through intensity measurements. Extension to more complicated geometries and/or radiative property fields affects only the direct- solution part of the problem, which has been discussed extensively in previous chapters.

Example 23.4. Consider a one- dimensional, absorbing- emitting (but not scattering) slab of width  $L$ , bounded by two cold, black walls. The temperature distribution within the slab is unknown, and is to be estimated with the quasi- Newton method, by measuring exit intensities on both bounding walls for various angles. The absorption coefficient of the medium at the detector wavelength,  $\kappa$ , is known and constant.

# Solution

Direct Problem. The direct solution for this simple problem is immediately found from equation (14.20) as

$$
\begin{array}{rl}{I(x,\mu) = -\int_{x}^{L}I_{b}(x^{\prime})e^{\kappa (x^{\prime} - x) / \mu}\kappa \frac{dx^{\prime}}{\mu},} & {\mu < 0,}\\ {= \int_{0}^{x}I_{b}(x^{\prime})e^{-\kappa (x - x^{\prime}) / \mu}\kappa \frac{dx^{\prime}}{\mu},} & {\mu >0,} \end{array}
$$

with  $I_{1} = I_{2} = 0$  (cold walls) and  $S = I_{b}$  (no scattering). Letting  $\tau_{i} = \kappa L$ ,  $\xi = x / L$ , and evaluating only the necessary intensities exiting from the faces at  $\xi = 0, 1$ , leads to

$$
\begin{array}{rlrl} & {I(0,\mu) = -\frac{\tau_L}{\mu}\int_0^1 I_b(\xi)e^{\tau_L\xi /\mu}d\xi ,} & & {\mu < 0,}\\ & {I(1,\mu) = \frac{\tau_L}{\mu}\int_0^1 I_b(\xi)e^{-\tau_L(1 - \xi) / \mu}d\xi ,} & & {\mu >0.} \end{array}
$$

Inverse Problem. We will assume that the unknown Planck function field  $I_{b}(\xi)$  can be approximated by a simple  $N$ th order polynomial, or

$$
I_{b}(\xi) = \sum_{n = 0}^{N}p_{n}\xi^{n}.
$$

(Power series, while simple and adequate for the present example, are generally not a good practice because the coefficients will vary over a wide range of magnitudes [24]). Substituting this into the direct solution for exiting intensity gives

$$
\begin{array}{c}{I(0,\mu) = -\sum_{n = 0}^{N}p_{n}f_{n}\left(\frac{\tau_{i}}{\mu}\right),\qquad \mu < 0,}\\ {I(1,\mu) = e^{-\tau_{i} / \mu}\sum_{n = 0}^{N}p_{n}f_{n}\left(\frac{\tau_{i}}{\mu}\right),\qquad \mu >0,}\\ {f_{n}(\tau) = \tau \int_{0}^{1}\xi^{n}e^{\tau \xi}d\xi = e^{\tau} - \frac{n}{\tau} f_{n - 1}(\tau).} \end{array} \tag{23.32b}
$$

Since the temperature (or Planck function) is to be found by measuring  $I(0, \mu)$  and  $I(1, \mu)$  for a set of  $I$  exit angles  $- 1 < \mu_{i} < +1$ , and assuming constant weights, the objective function becomes

$$
F = \sum_{i = 1}^{I}(I_{i} - Y_{i})^{2},
$$

where the  $I_{i}$  are evaluated from equation (23.32a) or (23.32b), depending on whether  $\mu_{i}$  is negative or positive, and the  $Y_{i}$  are the corresponding experimental data.

The sensitivity matrix is readily found by differentiating equations (23.32a) and (23.32b) with respect to  $p_n$ , leading to

$$
X_{in} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} - f_n\left(\frac{\tau_i}{\mu_i}\right), & \mu_i< 0,\\ e^{-\tau_i / \mu_i}f_n\left(\frac{\tau_i}{\mu_i}\right), & \mu_i > 0, \end{array} \right.
$$

and

$$
I_{i} = \sum_{n = 0}^{N}p_{n}X_{in}, \tag{23.33}
$$

since the problem is linear.

In order to use the quasi- Newton method, we first need to calculate the gradient vector from equation (23.25), or, assuming unity weights  $\mathbf{W} = \delta$ ,

$$
g_{n}^{k} = 2\sum_{i = 1}^{I}\left(I_{i}^{k} - Y_{i}\right)\frac{\partial I_{i}^{k}}{\partial p_{n}} = 2\sum_{i = 1}^{I}\left(I_{i}^{k} - Y_{i}\right)X_{in}. \tag{23.34}
$$

In the first iteration we set  $\mathbf{B}^{- 1} = \delta$ , and  $\mathbf{p}^1 = \mathbf{p}^0 - \beta^0\mathbf{g}^0$ , using a first guess for  $\mathbf{p}$  of  $p_n = \delta_{n0}$  (constant temperature slab). The proper step size  $\beta^0$  is found by minimizing  $F$  with respect to  $\beta^0$ , i.e., by setting

$$
\frac{\partial F}{\partial\beta^0} = 2\sum_{i = 1}^{I}(I_i - Y_i)\frac{\partial I_i}{\partial\beta^0} = 0,
$$

or

$$
2\sum_{i = 1}^{I}\left(\sum_{n = 0}^{N}\left(p_{n}^{0} - \beta^{0}g_{n}^{0}\right)X_{in} - Y_{i}\right)\left(-\sum_{n = 0}^{N}g_{n}^{0}X_{in}\right) = 0
$$

$$
\sum_{i = 1}^{I}\left(\sum_{n = 0}^{N}p_{n}^{0}X_{in} - Y_{i}\right)\left(\sum_{n = 0}^{N}g_{n}^{0}X_{in}\right) - \beta^{0}\sum_{i = 1}^{I}\left(\sum_{n = 0}^{N}g_{n}^{0}X_{in}\right)^{2} = 0
$$

and, finally

$$
\beta^0 = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{I}(X_{i0} - Y_i)\left(\sum_{n = 0}^{N}g_n^0X_{in}\right)}{\sum_{i = 1}^{I}\left(\sum_{n = 0}^{N}g_n^0X_{in}\right)^2}.
$$

For all following iterations we need to update  $\mathbf{B}^k$  according to equations (23.30) and (23.31a). Since we are only interested in the inverse of  $\mathbf{B}^k$ , it is usually more efficient to calculate it directly from the Sherman- Morrison formula [31]:

$$
\left(\mathbf{B}^k\right)^{-1} = \left(\mathbf{B}^{k - 1}\right)^{-1} + \frac{\left(\mathbf{d}^{k - 1}\cdot\mathbf{z}^k + \mathbf{z}^k\cdot\left(\mathbf{B}^{k - 1}\right)^{-1}\cdot\mathbf{z}^k\right)\mathbf{d}^{k - 1}\mathbf{d}^{k - 1}}{\left(\mathbf{d}^{k - 1}\cdot\mathbf{z}^k\right)^2} -\frac{\left(\mathbf{B}^{k - 1}\right)^{-1}\cdot\mathbf{z}^k\mathbf{d}^{k - 1} + \mathbf{d}^{k - 1}\mathbf{z}^k\cdot\left(\mathbf{B}^{k - 1}\right)^{-1}}{\mathbf{d}^{k - 1}\cdot\mathbf{z}^k}, \tag{23.35a}
$$

or, in expanded notation,

$$
\left(\mathbf{B}^k\right)_{ij}^{-1} = \left(\mathbf{B}^{k - 1}\right)_{ij}^{-1} + \frac{\left(\sum_l d_l^{k - 1}z_l^k + \sum_l\sum_m z_l^k\left(\mathbf{B}^{k - 1}\right)_{lm}^{-1}z_m^k\right)d_i^{k - 1}d_j^{k - 1}}{\left(\sum_l d_l^{k - 1}z_l^k\right)^2} -\frac{\sum_l\left(\mathbf{B}^{k - 1}\right)_{il}^{-1}z_l^k d_{l}^{k - 1} + d_i^{k - 1}\sum_l z_l^k\left(\mathbf{B}^{k - 1}\right)_{ij}^{-1}}{\sum_l d_l^{k - 1}z_l^k}. \tag{23.35b}
$$

After each iteration the objective function is recalculated, and the procedure is stopped when  $F$  no longer decreases (substantially).

Figure 23- 6 shows the simulation results for a Planck function field of

$$
I_{b}(\xi) = 1 + 3\xi^{2} - 4\xi^{4}
$$

for various optical thicknesses, and using 20 equally spaced measurement directions. For errorless measurements  $Y_i$ , the exact result is recovered for all optical thicknesses. Figure 23- 6 shows the estimated

FIGURE 23-6 Planck function distribution for Example 23.4 predicted by the quasi-Newton method.

Planck function field for measurements that have been given a random Gaussian error, with a relative variance of  $3\%$ . It is seen that the Planck function field recovery is rather poor for optically thin slabs, getting more and more accurate as the optical thickness increases (up to a point: at very large  $\tau_{L}$  the exiting intensities become independent of the internal temperature field and, thus, the temperature field cannot be recovered).

# The Levenberg-Marquardt Method

The Levenberg- Marquardt method was originally devised for nonlinear parameter estimation problems, but has also proved useful for the solution of ill- conditioned linear problems [3,25, 41,42]. In this method the problem of inverting a near- singular matrix is avoided by increasing the value of each diagonal term in the matrix, i.e., by regularizing the Gauss- Newton method of equation (23.13) to

$$
\mathbf{p}^{k + 1} = \mathbf{p}^k +(\mathbf{X}^{Tk}\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \mathbf{X}^k +\mu^k\pmb {\Omega}^k)^{-1}\cdot \mathbf{X}^{Tk}\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot (\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{i}^k), \tag{23.36}
$$

where  $\mu^k$  is a positive scalar called the damping parameter, and  $\Omega^k$  is a diagonal matrix. In this equation the inverse is an approximation of the Hessian matrix, and the remainder is the negative of the gradient vector, as given by equation (23.7). Levenberg suggested several choices for the diagonal matrix  $\Omega^k$ , among them  $\Omega^k = \delta$  (each diagonal term is increased by a fixed amount  $\mu^k$ ) and  $\Omega_{ii}^k = (X^{Tk}\cdot W\cdot X^k)_{ii}$  (each diagonal term is increased by a fixed percentage). As with regularization, large values for  $\mu^k$  dampen out oscillations in the ill- conditioned system, but also change the solution. Thus, after starting the iteration with a relatively large value of  $\mu^k$ , its value is gradually decreased as the iteration approaches convergence. Comparison with equation (23.21) shows that the method is related to Tikhonov regularization, but using a gradually decreasing regularization parameter.

Different versions of the Levenberg- Marquardt method have been incorporated into various numerical libraries, such as the Numerical Recipes [37] and IMSL routines [43].

# The Conjugate Gradient Method

The conjugate gradient method is another simple and powerful iterative technique to solve linear and nonlinear minimization problems. The method is explained in detail in a number of books, such as [21, 24, 44- 46]. In this method the direction of descent is found as a conjugate of the gradient direction and the previous direction of descent, or

$$
\begin{array}{r}\mathbf{d}^k = -\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{p}^{k - 1}) + \gamma^k\mathbf{d}^{k - 1}, \end{array} \tag{23.37}
$$

with  $\gamma^k$  being the conjugation coefficient and  $\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{p}^{k - 1}) = \nabla_pF(\mathbf{p}^{k - 1})$  evaluated from equation (23.25).

The search step size  $\beta^k$  is taken as the value that minimizes the objective function at the next iteration,  $F(\mathbf{p}^{k + 1})$ : using equations (23.3) and (23.24) together with the Taylor expansion, equation (23.12), leads to

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {F(\mathbf{p}^{k + 1}) = \left(\mathrm{i}(\mathbf{p}^k +\beta^k\mathbf{d}^k) - \mathbf{y}\right)\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \left(\mathrm{i}(\mathbf{p}^k +\beta^k\mathbf{d}^k) - \mathbf{y}\right)}\\ & {\qquad \approx \left(\mathrm{i}(\mathbf{p}^k) - \mathbf{y} + \beta^k\mathbf{X}^k\cdot \mathbf{d}^k\right)\cdot \mathbf{W}\cdot \left(\mathrm{i}(\mathbf{p}^k) - \mathbf{y} + \beta^k\mathbf{X}^k\cdot \mathbf{d}^k\right).} \end{array} \tag{23.38}
$$

Differentiating with respect to  $\beta^k$ , setting  $\beta I^{k + 1} / \beta \beta^k = 0$ , and solving for  $\beta^k$  results in

$$
\beta^{k} = \frac{(\mathbf{X}^{k}\cdot\mathbf{d}^{k})\cdot\mathbf{W}\cdot(\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{i}^{k})}{(\mathbf{X}^{k}\cdot\mathbf{d}^{k})\cdot\mathbf{W}\cdot(\mathbf{X}^{k}\cdot\mathbf{d}^{k})}, \tag{23.39a}
$$

or, in expanded notation,

$$
\beta^{k} = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{I}\frac{Y_{i} - I_{i}^{k}}{\sigma_{i}^{2}}\sum_{j = 1}^{J}X_{ij}^{k}d_{j}^{k}}{\sum_{i = 1}^{I}\frac{1}{\sigma_{i}^{2}}\left(\sum_{j = 1}^{J}X_{ij}^{k}d_{j}^{k}\right)^{2}}. \tag{23.39b}
$$

Several different expressions are in use for the conjugation coefficient  $\gamma^k$ . We mention here only the simple Fletcher- Reeves expression

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\gamma^{k} = \frac{\left\|{\bf g}^{k}\right\|^{2}}{\left\|{\bf g}^{k - 1}\right\|^{2}},\qquad k = 1,2,\ldots ,}\\ & {\qquad = 0,\qquad k = 0.} \end{array} \tag{23.40a}
$$

In expanded notation  $\left\| \mathbf{g}^k\right\| ^2$  becomes, from equation (23.25),

$$
\left\| \mathbf{g}^k\right\| ^2 = 4\sum_{j = 1}^{J}\left(\sum_{i = 1}^{I}\frac{I_i^k - Y_i}{\sigma_i^2} X_{ij}^k\right)^2. \tag{23.41}
$$

Example 23.5. Repeat Example 23.4 using the conjugate gradient method.

# Solution

The solution proceeds exactly as in the previous example up to and including the evaluation of the gradient vector. But, in order to use the conjugate gradient method the  $\gamma^k$  and  $\beta^k$  coefficients need to be calculated from equations (23.39) through (23.41), i.e.,

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {| \mathbf{g}^k| ^2 = \sum_{n = 0}^{N}(g_n^k)^2 = 4\sum_{n = 0}^{N}(\sum_{i = 1}^{I}(I_i^k -Y_i)X_{in}^k)^2,}\\ & {\beta^k = \sum_{i = 1}^{I}(Y_i - I_i^k)\sum_{n = 0}^{N}X_{in}^k d_n^k\left / \sum_{i = 1}^{I}(\sum_{n = 0}^{N}X_{in}^k d_n^k)^2.} \end{array} \tag{23.43}
$$

The calculation proceeds as follows:

1. Since the problem is linear, the sensitivity matrix is precalculated once and for all.  
2. An initial guess is made for the parameter vector (such as  $p_n = 0$ , all  $n$ ), and the iteration counter is set to  $k = 0$ .  
3. The direct solution  $I_i^k$  is found from equation (23.33), and the objective function  $F^k$  is calculated; if it meets certain stopping criteria, the iteration is terminated.

4. The gradient of  $F^k$  is found from equation (23.34);  $\gamma^k$  is calculated by division with the previous value of  $\left\| \mathbf{g}^k\right\| ^2$  (for the first iteration, the "old" value is set to a very large number to force  $\gamma^0 = 0$ ). A new search direction  $\mathbf{d}^k$  is set from equation (23.37).

5. The search step size is determined from equation (23.39), and the parameter vector is updated with equation (23.24). The calculation returns then to step 3 above (alternatively, the step size  $\beta^k$ , or the change in the parameter vector can also be used as stopping criteria).

The simulation results for the same field as in Example 23.4, again using 20 equally spaced measurement directions, give essentially identical results when using the conjugate gradient approach, i.e., for errorless measurements the exact result is recovered for all optical thicknesses, and for random Gaussian error are similar to those of Fig. 23.4.

The problem was also solved using various other inversion techniques, viz., quasi- Newton BFGS with line search (i.e., BFGS with  $\beta^k \neq 1$  found from the relation for  $\beta^0$  in Example 23.4, with  $g_n^0$  replaced by  $- d_k^k$ ), Tikhonov regularization, and the method of steepest descent. All methods return very similar temperature profiles. The number of iterations and CPU times required for the different methods is compared in Table 23.1. Tikhonov regularization does not require any iteration (for this linear problem) and is, together with the conjugate gradient method, the fastest. Of the iterative methods conjugate gradients requires the fewest iterations and is thus the fastest, while BFGS with line search does not appreciably increase convergence, thus taking a little longer than BFGS without it. Not surprisingly, the method of steepest descent requires many more iterations.

# 23.5 METAHEURISTICS

Metaheuristics also belong to the family of optimization. They received their name because they are not based on a mathematically rigorous minimization formulation—in contrast to gradient- based methods, which usually approximate the objective function as locally quadratic, and then find the minimum via a Taylor series expansion. The algorithms of many metaheuristics are inspired by physics or biology (genetic algorithms and swarm algorithms are important examples of biomimicry). One popular algorithm is simulated annealing, which is based on the changing arrangement of atoms in metals. The simulated annealing algorithm is analogous to nature, where the objective function is the lattice energy, and the design parameters specify the lattice arrangement. The Second Law of Thermodynamics drives a system toward a lower energy state, so the atoms in a metal will preferentially move into lower energy configurations, but can spontaneously move into a high energy configuration. The same idea applies in metaheuristics, and the nomenclature "annealing schedule," "temperature," etc. carries over. At each iteration a candidate step is proposed, analogous to atoms randomly moving. A new candidate objective function is generated and compared to the present one. If the new objective function is lower, the candidate step is always accepted (probability of unity). If the new objective function is larger, the candidate step is accepted with a probability proportional to  $\exp (- \Delta F / T)$ , where the "annealing" temperature" is defined in terms of the iteration number  $k$ . Thus, higher  $T$  make uphill steps more likely (smaller  $k$ ) and, as temperature decreases (cooling the metal), accepting

an uphill step becomes increasingly improbable (large  $k$ ). As in actual metal annealing, the underlying idea behind simulated annealing is that the method allows the design parameters to transition through a temporary higher energy state (a crest in the objective function topography) in their quest for the lowest energy level (global minimum).

By their nature metaheuristics are inevitably less efficient than gradient- based methods at finding local minima. Therefore, they should only be used when gradient- based methods are unreliable or impractical, or if the objective function topography is suspected to have multiple local minima.

# 23.6 SUMMARY OF INVERSE RADIATION RESEARCH

# Inverse Surface Radiation

While inverse radiation problems involving a participating medium received the earliest attention, more recently a number of researchers have concerned themselves with inverse surface radiation problems. Harutunian et al. [47], Fedorov et al. [48], Jones [17], Erturk et al. [49] and Franca et al. [50], were the first to recognize the potential of inverse radiation analysis for control: they investigated the needed energy input into a heating element, in order to achieve a prespecified result at a design surface. This was followed with considerable more work by the group around Howell [35, 40, 51- 54] and a few others [55]. That inverse analysis can also be used to deduce surface reflectances was demonstrated by Wu and Wu [18].

Various solution techniques were employed. For example, TSVD was used by Franca et al. [50,53] to predict heater performance in the presence of convection, and by Daun and coworkers [35] for 3D surface heating; the latter also used Tikhonov regularization, quasi- Newton and conjugate gradient techniques (optimization), and simulated annealing (metaheuristics). The conjugate gradient method was also used by Erturk et al. [51], who optimized transient heating control of a furnace, while Porter and Howell [52] used metaheuristic methods (simulated annealing and tabu search) to control a surface heater. Daun and coworkers [40, 56] and Leduc et al. [55] performed geometric optimization of radiant enclosures using Tikhonov regularization [55], the quasi- Newton method [40], and Kiefer- Wolfowitz stochastic programming (a variation on the steepest descent scheme) [56]. The only work reporting experimental verification seems to be the one by Erturk et al. [54], who investigated radiative heating control of silicon wafers. They found that accurate knowledge of radiative properties is crucial, and obtained wafer temperatures to within  $3\%$  of the target value.

# Inverse Radiation in Participating Media

Most research to date on inverse radiation within a participating medium has centered around the retrieval of temperature distributions, with some also deducing various radiative properties, such as surface reflectances, scattering albedos, and phase functions. Much of the work dealt with pure radiation in mostly gray [9- 16, 57- 68], and a few nongray [69, 70], constant- property, one- dimensional media. Others have dealt with multidimensional geometries [71- 85], and interactions between conduction and radiation have also received growing attention [76, 77, 86- 89], along with, to a lesser extent, inverse radiation combined with convection [90]. Most of these investigations have concentrated on developing an inverse method using artificial data. Only a few experiments have been combined with inverse analysis to measure particle distributions and scattering properties of pulverized coal [91, 92], and to infer temperature and concentration distributions in axisymmetric flames [93- 99]. Most of these determined spatial averages [93] or used Abel's transformation [94- 98] (reconstruction from spatial scans). However, it has been shown that these profiles can also be determined from a single transmission measurement through spectrometry (reconstruction from spectral scan) [70, 98- 100].

More recently, there has been growing interest in optical tomography, the reconstruction of property fields based on radiative field measurements. Two areas of interest have been identified. One is the detection of internal tumors in biomedical applications, generally using ultrafast lasers with transient radiation effects (see also Chapter 19) [101- 106]. A recent review with many references has been given by Charette and colleagues [36]. Secondly, optical tomography is increasingly applied to the diagnosis of combustion systems [39, 107- 109].

As for surface radiation problems, several different inverse methodologies have been employed, such as TSVD [69], Tikhonov regularization [39, 108], Tikhonov regularization plus Kalman filtering (to connect information from transient signals) [109], conjugate gradient methods [68, 81, 101- 106, 110, 111], and metaheuristics [67, 70, 80, 81, 84].

# Comparison of Inverse Solution Methods

A few studies used several inversion techniques to allow for comparison. Daun and coworkers [35], in order to investigate surface heater control in a 3D furnace, used five different inversion techniques, viz., TSVD and Tikhonov regularization, two optimizations (the quasi- Newton and conjugate gradient methods), and one metaheuristic scheme (simulated annealing). They found that all techniques predicted solutions within acceptable accuracy, but the methods in some cases provided widely different distributions that achieve the same final result. The regularization, conjugate gradient, and simulated annealing methods provided smooth distributions of heater inputs across the heater surface, whereas the quasi- Newton technique tended to give uneven distributions. In another study Deiveegan et al. [67] retrieved surface emittances and gas properties in gray participating media, using the Levenberg- Marquardt method, and several metaheuristics schemes, i.e., genetic algorithms, artificial neural networks, and Bayesian statistics. They also found that all methods gave acceptable results, with Bayesian statistics being least susceptible to random noise, and genetic algorithms being considerably more computationally expensive.

We conclude our discussion of solution methods with one simple, nonlinear example.

Example 23.6. Repeat Example 23.5 for the case that the absorption coefficient is also unknown and, thus, must be estimated, as well. Compare performance and effort of the quasi- Newton, Levenberg- Marquardt, and conjugate gradient methods.

# Solution

The solution is identical to the previous example, only now the parameter vector  $\mathbf{p}$  has one additional member,  $\kappa$ , or equivalently,  $\tau_{L}$ . The sensitivity matrix is identical to the one of Example 23.4, except that it has one additional row, namely

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & X_{i,N + 1} = \frac{\partial I_i}{\partial\tau_L} = -\sum_{n = 0}^{N}a_n\left[\frac{1}{\tau_L} f_n\left(\frac{\tau_L}{\mu_i}\right) + \frac{1}{\mu_i} f_{n + 1}\left(\frac{\tau_L}{\mu_i}\right)\right],\qquad \mu_i< 0,\\ & \qquad = e^{-\tau_L / \mu_i}\sum_{n = 0}^{N}a_n\left[\left(\frac{1}{\tau_L} -\frac{1}{\mu_i}\right)f_n\left(\frac{\tau_L}{\mu_i}\right) + \frac{1}{\mu_i} f_{n + 1}\left(\frac{\tau_L}{\mu_i}\right)\right],\qquad \mu_i > 0. \end{array}
$$

The problem is now nonlinear, since all  $X_{in}$  contain the unknown parameter  $\tau_{L}$ , and  $X_{i,N + 1}$  also contains the  $a_{n}$ . This causes no problem in the conjugate gradient method, except that the sensitivity matrix now has to be evaluated anew after each iteration (i.e., in the calculation procedure of Example 23.5 steps 1 and 2 are interchanged, and the iteration always repeats from step 2).

Results for the conjugate gradient method are shown in Fig. 23- 7. Again, the exact relations are recovered for undisturbed measurements, and the cases shown are for measurements with a random Gaussian error with  $3\%$  relative variance. Results are very similar to Example 23.3, perhaps just a little worse, and recovery of the absorption coefficient is well within the variance of the data, except for Levenberg- Marquardt, which incurs errors up to  $5\%$  for small and large  $\tau_{L}$ . On the other hand, Levenberg- Marquardt also is the fastest of the different methods for this problem, as seen in Table 23.2, which shows the time requirements for the different methods.

# Problems

23.1 Repeat Example 23.2, but determine the necessary heat flux distribution,  $q_{2}(x_{2})$ , along the plate.

23.2 A black plate of width  $\upsilon$  is irradiated by two line sources as shown. The plate is insulated at the bottom, while the top loses heat by radiation to the (cold) environment. Ideally, the plate should be at a uniform temperature of  $500\mathrm{K}$ . Breaking up the plate into four equally wide segments, determine the optimal heater powers (without exploiting the symmetry):

a) using TSVD on the direct equations (23.19),  
b) using TSVD and the normal equations (23.10),  
c) using Tikhonov regularization and the normal equations.

23.3 Soot volume fraction and temperature are to be determined by measuring the transmissivity of a gas- soot layer for several wavelengths. Consider a homogeneous layer of thickness  $L = 0.2\mathrm{m}$ , whose absorption coefficient obeys equation (12.123), where  $C_0$  is a known function of wavelength and temperature, such that

$$
C_0(\lambda ,T) = 5[1 + a\lambda (T - T_0)],\quad T_0 = 300\mathrm{K},\quad a = 0.01(\mu \mathrm{mK})^{-1}.
$$

Transmissivity measurements are conducted at four wavelengths as shown in the table: one set of data has been taken with high precision (i.e., zero error), and the other has some noise in the data.

Determine soot volume fraction and temperature using Tikhonov regularization.

23.4 Repeat Problem 23.3 using the quasi- Newton method.

23.5 Consider a one- dimensional, absorbing- emitting (but not scattering) slab of width  $L$ , bounded by two cold, black walls. The temperature distribution within the slab is unknown, and is to be estimated by measuring spectral exit heat fluxes on both bounding walls for various wavenumbers in a range over which the absorption coefficient of the medium,  $\kappa$ , is known, is linearly proportional to wavenumber, and is spatially constant. Use the  $P_{1}$ - approximation and Tikhonov regularization.

Hint: Set up a 1D finite difference solution for the  $P_{1}$ - approximation by breaking up the slab into  $N$  isothermal layers; then determine  $M > N$  wall fluxes in terms of the  $I_{b0}(T_{i})$ .

23.6 Repeat Problem 23.5 for a medium that also scatters radiation isentropically, with a gray scattering coefficient.

23.7 Repeat Problem 23.5 for the case of an unknown absorption coefficient (except for the fact that it is linearly proportional to wavenumber). Use the  $P_{1}$ - approximation together with the quasi- Newton algorithm.

23.8 In laser absorption tomography, the concentration of a target species (e.g., gas or soot) is inferred from the transmittance of multiple lasers passing through the flow field. If the domain is split into  $n$  regions in each of which the concentration is assumed uniform, the Beer- Lambert law along the  $i$ th beam becomes

$$
\ln (I_{0i} / I_i) = \sum_{j = 1}^{n}A_{ij}\kappa_j,
$$

where  $A_{ij}$  is the chord length of the  $i$ th beam subtended by the  $j$ th element. Writing this equation for  $m$  beams results in an  $m \times n$  matrix equation,  $\mathbf{A} \cdot \mathbf{p} = \mathbf{b}$ , which relates the beam transmittance data,  $\mathbf{b}$ , to the unknown species concentration (through the absorption coefficient,  $\mathbf{p} = \kappa$ ), equivalent to equation (23.19). However, even if  $n = m$  the matrix is ill- conditioned, and its inversion must be regularized to suppress measurement noise amplification.

Consider the axisymmetric problem shown to the right. Laser transmittance measurements made along the center of each annular element are summarized in the table below. It is known that each data point is contaminated by normally- distributed error having a standard deviation of 0.025.

# CHAPTER 24

# NANOSCALE RADIATIVE TRANSFER

# 24.1 INTRODUCTION

In the last chapter of this book we will provide a brief introduction to radiative heat transfer in geometries where the pertinent dimensions are measured in nanometers (nm). Research in the field of nanoscale energy transfer has exploded during the past few years, leading to fascinating new problems and devices in microelectronics and microfabrication technology, such as quantum structures, optoelectronics, molecular- and atomic- level imaging techniques, etc. Most radiation is incoherent (multispectral, as well as random in polarization and direction) in the "far field" (a distance of a wavelength or so away from the source), and the radiative transfer equation (RTE) and its solution methods described over the previous chapters are only valid for such incoherent radiation. We noticed in Chapters 2 and 3 (optically smooth surfaces) and Chapter 12 (small particles) that, when distances of the order of the wavelength  $\lambda$  are relevant, radiative transfer must be calculated from the full Maxwell's equations presented in Chapter 2. However, Maxwell's equations do not include any radiative emission sources, which must be modeled via what is known as fluctuational electrodynamics, pioneered by Rytov [1,2].

In the following we will give very brief accounts of some interesting radiative phenomena that are observed at the nanoscale, culminating in the prediction of radiative flux between two plates, spaced a tiny distance apart. The reader interested in detailed knowledge of the subject area should consult the books by Chen [3], Novotny and Hecht [4], and Zhang [5], review articles by Basu and coworkers [6] and Zhang and Park [7], as well as the large number of recent research papers in the field.

# 24.2 COHERENCE OF LIGHT

24.2 COHERENCE OF LIGHTNo radiation source is perfectly coherent, i.e., perfectly monochromatic and unidirectional, not even lasers or emission from single atoms. On the other hand, no source is truly incoherent: even the most chaotic blackbody radiation has a small coherence length, which is related to the distance the wave travels within a coherence time [5]. If the wave nature of light is completely preserved, we speak of coherent light. If light travels longer than the coherence time, or a distance larger than the coherence length, fluctuations in the waves will diminish wave interference effects (see Fig. 2- 13 and the discussion of reflection from a thin layer). The coherence of light in space and time (or, equivalently, frequency) is measured by the mutual coherence function of any two waves, defined as  $\langle E(\mathbf{r}_1, t)E^* (\mathbf{r}_2, t) \rangle$ , where the angular brackets denote time- averaging, and the  $\mathbf{r}_1$  and  $\mathbf{r}_2$  are two different locations; the electric field can be expressed in either the frequency

domain, or time domain [5]. For our purposes we simply note that the coherence length of random blackbody radiation is about  $\lambda /2$  [4,8], and longer for more coherent sources.

# 24.3 EVANESCENT WAVES

We observed in Section 2.5, equation (2.100), that at an interface between two dielectrics total reflection takes place if light attempts to enter a less dense material  $(n_{2}< n_{1})$  at an incidence angle  $\theta_{1}$  larger than the critical angle

$$
\sin \theta_{1} > \sin \theta_{c} = \frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}, \tag{24.1}
$$

with no energy penetrating into Medium 2 (see Fig. 24- 1a). This is true as far as far- field radiation is concerned, and also for net (time- and space- averaged) energy. However, if one carefully inspects the electromagnetic wave theory relationships, one observes that a wave traveling parallel to the interface enters Medium 2, with its strength decreasing exponentially away from the interface, known as an evanescent wave (from Latin for "vanishing"). To simplify the analysis we will, without loss of generality, consider here only the case of a parallel polarized (TM) wave  $(E_{\perp} = 0)$ , and only concern ourselves with the electric field. Then, from equations (2.73) and (2.75), we have

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\mathbf{E}_{c1} = E_{||i}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{||i}e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}_i\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)} + E_{||r}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{||r}e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}_r\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)},}\\ & {\mathbf{E}_{c2} = E_{||t}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_{||t}e^{-2\pi i(\mathbf{w}_t\cdot \mathbf{r} - \nu t)},} \end{array} \tag{24.2a}
$$

and the wave vector  $\mathbf{w}$ , as defined<sup>1</sup> by equation (2.31) has  $x$ - and  $z$ - components

$$
\mathbf{w} = \eta_0n\hat{\mathbf{s}} = w_x\hat{\mathbf{1}} +w_z\hat{\mathbf{k}}. \tag{24.3}
$$

Since the tangential components of the electrical field must be conserved, equation (2.67), we have  $w_{xi} = w_{xr} = w_{xt} = w_{x}$ , and

$$
w_{x} = \eta_{0}n_{1}\sin \theta_{1} = \eta_{0}n_{2}\sin \theta_{2}, \tag{24.4}
$$

which is Snell's law. If  $\theta_{1}$  exceeds the critical angle, then

$$
n_1\sin \theta_1 > n_1\sin \theta_c > n_2, \tag{24.5}
$$

and the  $z$ - component of the transmitted wave becomes

$$
w_{z t} = \sqrt{(\eta_{0}n_{2})^{2} - w_{x}^{2}} = i\eta_{0}\sqrt{(n_{1}\sin\theta_{1})^{2} - n_{2}^{2}} = i|w_{z t}| = i\eta_{0}n_{2}|\cos \theta_{2}|, \tag{24.6}
$$

i.e.,  $w_{z t}$  and  $\cos \theta_{2}$  are purely imaginary (and  $|w_{z t}|$  and  $|\cos \theta_{2}|$  are their magnitudes). Substituting this into equation (24.2b) we have

$$
\mathbf{E}_{c2} = E_{||\mathbf{k}}\hat{\mathbf{k}} e^{-2\pi |w_{z t}| + 2\pi i\nu t}, \tag{24.7}
$$

with the magnitude of  $|w_{z t}| = \mathcal{O}\{\eta_{0} = 1 / \lambda_{0}\}$ , i.e., we have a wave inside Medium 2 traveling along the interface, exponentially decaying in strength over the distance of one wavelength or so (depending on  $\theta_{1}$ ). This is depicted in Fig. 24- 1b. Performing the same analysis for the magnetic field (with  $H_{||} = 0$ ), it is easy to show that the  $z$ - component of the time- averaged Poynting vector, see equation (2.42), is zero, i.e., no net energy crosses the interface [3]. However, if the instantaneous Poynting vector is examined, one finds that there is periodic in- and outflow of energy carried by the evanescent field.

# 24.4 RADIATION TUNNELING

We have seen in the previous section that, if a radiative wave train is reflected at the interface to an optically less dense medium, an evanescent wave exists within the optically rarer medium with exponentially decaying strength away from the interface. Furthermore, the evanescent wave does not carry any net (time- averaged) energy into the direction normal to the surface. However, if a second denser medium is brought into close proximity to the first, net energy can be transported across the gap or intermediate layer. This phenomenon is known as radiation tunneling (or sometimes as photon tunneling, or frustrated total internal reflection [5]), and is very important for heat transfer between two media a distance of a wavelength or less apart, as schematically shown in Fig. 24- 2. While this phenomenon has been known since Newton's time, in the heat transfer area it was probably first discovered by Cravalho and coworkers [9], who investigated closely spaced cryogenic insulation. Today's important applications range from thermophotovoltaic devices to nanothermal processing and nanoelectronics thermal management [5].

If a second optically dense material is close to the first, the evanescent wave in the layer in between is reflected back toward the first interface. Interference between the two waves cause the Poynting vector to have a nonzero net component in the  $\mathcal{Z}$  - direction. However, if the gap is too wide (i.e., well more than one wavelength away), the evanescent wave reaching the second interface is too weak and net energy transfer becomes negligible. To calculate the transmissivity of the gap or intermediate film for above- critical angles of incidence we may use the thin film relations developed in Chapter 2, keeping in mind that  $\cos \theta_{2}$  may become imaginary for large incidence angles. Limiting ourselves here to three dielectrics with  $n_1 = n_3 > n_2,$  equations  $(2.131b)$  and (2.133) may be rewritten as

$$
t = \frac{t_{12}t_{21}e^{i\beta}}{1 - r_{21}^{2}e^{2i\beta}},T = t t^{*},\beta = 2\pi w_{2z}d = 2\pi n_{2}\cos \theta_{2}\frac{d}{\lambda}, \tag{24.8}
$$

with  $r_{21},t_{12},$  and  $t_{21}$  determined from equations (2.89) through (2.92). For  $\theta_{1}< \theta_{c}$  the interface reflection and transmission coefficients are real, and

$$
T_{\lambda} = \frac{(t_{12}t_{21})^{2}}{1 - 2r_{21}^{2}\cos 2\beta + r_{21}^{4}} = \frac{(1 - r_{21}^{2})^{2}}{1 - 2r_{21}^{2}\cos 2\beta + r_{21}^{4}},\quad \theta_{1}< \theta_{c} = \sin \left(\frac{n_{2}}{n_{1}}\right). \tag{24.9}
$$

If  $\theta_{1}$  exceeds the critical angle an evanescent wave enters Medium 2 and  $w_{2z}$  and  $\cos \theta_{2}$  become purely imaginary. From equation (24.6) we find that the phase shift  $\beta$  now becomes imaginary (the exponential decay of the evanescent wave),

$$
\beta = i(2\pi n_2|\cos \theta_2|)\frac{d}{\lambda} = i|\beta |, \tag{24.10}
$$

and the  $r_{21},t_{12},$  and  $t_{21}$  become complex [i.e., replacing  $\cos \theta_{2}$  by  $i|\cos \theta_{2}|$  in equations (24.8) and (24.9)]. Therefore,

$$
t = \frac{t_{12}t_{21}e^{-|\beta|}}{1 + r_{21}^{2}e^{-2|\beta|}}, \tag{24.11}
$$

and

$$
T_{\lambda} = t t^{*} = \frac{(t_{12}t_{21})(t_{12}^{*}t_{21}^{*})e^{-2|\beta|}}{1 + \big(r_{21}^{2} + r_{21}^{*2}\big)e^{-2|\beta|} + r_{21}^{2}r_{21}^{*2}e^{-4|\beta|}}, \tag{24.12}
$$

which, after some algebra (left as an exercise), may be reduced to

$$
T_{\lambda} = \frac{\sin^{2}2\alpha}{\sin^{2}2\alpha + \sinh^{2}|\beta|},\mathrm{~where~}\tan \alpha = \left\{ \begin{array}{l l}{\frac{n_{1}|\cos\theta_{2}|}{n_{2}\cos\theta_{1}},} & \mathrm{parallel~(TM)~polarization,}\\ {\frac{n_{2}|\cos\theta_{2}|}{n_{1}\cos\theta_{1}},} & \mathrm{perpendicular~(TE)~polarization.} \end{array} \right. \tag{24.13}
$$

Again, equation (24.13) is valid for, both, parallel- and perpendicular- polarized light, except for the different definition of tan  $\alpha$  (due to the different structure of  $r_{\parallel}$  and  $r_{\perp}$  -

Example 24.1. Consider a vacuum gap surrounded by a dielectric medium with refractive index  $n_1 = n_3 = \sqrt{2} = 1.4142$  . Determine the transmissivity for parallel- polarized light for all angles of incidence and as a function of gap width.

# Solution

With  $n_2 = 1$  we have  $\sin \theta_{c} = 1 / \sqrt{2},$  or  $\theta_{c} = 45^{\circ}$  . Writing a small computer code, using equation (24.9) for  $\theta_{1}< 45^{\circ}$  , and equation (24.13) for  $\theta_{1} > 45^{\circ}$  , and with

$$
\tan \alpha = \frac{n_1|\cos\theta_2|}{n_2\cos\theta_1},
$$

FIGURE 24-3 Transmissivity of a vacuum gap surrounded by identical dielectrics  $(n_{1} = n_{3} = 1.4142)$ , for parallel-polarized light.

we obtain the gap transmissivity shown in Fig. 24- 3. It is observed that for small  $\theta_{1}$  we have noticeable interference effects, but the transmissivity remains high for all gap widths  $(T_{\lambda} > 0.9)$ . Wavelength of interference and magnitude increase with  $\theta_{1}$  until, reaching Brewster's angle  $(\approx 35^{\circ})$ , we have total transmission of a parallel- polarized wave (see also Fig. 2- 9). Beyond Brewster's angle  $\rho_{\parallel}$  increases rapidly, with decreasing transmissivity (but still increasing wavelength of interference). At  $\theta_{1} = 45^{\circ}$  we have  $r_{\parallel} = - 1$ , and an evanescent wave forms, and the larger the incident angle, the faster the strength of the evanescent wave decays across the gap. It is straightforward to verify that, at  $45^{\circ}$ , both equations (24.9) and (24.13), go to the same limit, i.e.,

$$
T_{\lambda}(\theta_{1} = 45^{\circ}) = \frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{\pi}{2}\frac{d}{\lambda}\right)}.
$$

# 24.5 SURFACE WAVES (POLARITONS)

The interaction between electromagnetic waves and the oscillatory movement of free charges (electrons) near the surface of metallic materials is known as surface plasmons or surface plasmon polaritons. Surface plasmons are usually found in the visible to near- infrared part of the spectrum in highly conductive metals, such as gold, silver, and aluminum. They are of importance in near- field microscopy and nanophotonics [5, 10- 12]. In some polar dielectrics lattice vibrations (phonons) and/or oscillations of bound charges can also interact with electromagnetic waves in the mid- infrared; these are known as surface phonon polaritons, and are of interest in the tuning of emission properties [13] and nanoscale imaging [14]. In either case they result in the generation of an electromagnetic wave traveling along, and only in the immediate vicinity of both sides of an interface, i.e., a surface wave. In our brief discussion here we will mostly follow the presentation of Zhang [5].

One requirement of a surface wave, i.e., a wave decaying in both directions normal to the surface, is that there are evanescent waves on both sides of the interface. Consider the arrangement shown in Fig. 24- 4, consisting of a thin layer and a thick substrate, with the thin layer bound at the top by a third medium. The thin layer may be air with a metallic substrate (Otto configuration), or a metal layer bounded by air at the bottom (Kretschmann configuration) [15]. If light is incident from the top medium, it is possible for evanescent waves to occur simultaneously in both the underlying air and metal layers, as also indicated in Fig. 24- 4. A second requirement for polaritons is that the polariton dispersion relations must be satisfied,

which are the poles of the Fresnel reflection coefficients, since infinite reflection coefficients are an indication of resonance. If one writes the reflection coefficients in terms of wave- vector components [4, 5] as

$$
\begin{array}{r}r_{\parallel} = (\frac{w_{1z}}{\epsilon_1} -\frac{w_{2z}}{\epsilon_2})\left / (\frac{w_{1z}}{\epsilon_1} +\frac{w_{2z}}{\epsilon_2}),\\ r_{\perp} = (\frac{w_{1z}}{\mu_1} -\frac{w_{2z}}{\mu_2})\left / (\frac{w_{1z}}{\mu_1} +\frac{w_{2z}}{\mu_2}), \end{array} \tag{24.14b}
$$

the polariton dispersion relations are defined by

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & {\frac{w_{1z}}{\epsilon_1} +\frac{w_{2z}}{\epsilon_2} = 0,\quad \mathrm{for~parallel - polarized~light},}\\ & {\frac{w_{1z}}{\mu_1} -\frac{w_{2z}}{\mu_2} = 0,\quad \mathrm{for~perpendicular - polarized~light}.} \end{array} \tag{24.15b}
$$

The nature of the dispersion relations is more easily understood by first looking at the case of two dielectric media: in order to have evanescent waves we must have both  $w_{1z}$  and  $w_{2z}$  purely imaginary, with  $w_{1z} = - i|w_{1z}|$  and  $w_{2z} = - i|w_{2z}|$ , i.e., both with a negative sign in order to have  $e^{- 2\pi iw_{1}\cdot \mathbf{r}} = e^{- 2\pi i(w_{1x}x + w_{2z}z)} = e^{- 2\pi iw_{1x}x + 2\pi |w_{1z}|z}$  (reflected wave) decay toward negative  $z$ , and  $e^{- 2\pi iw_{1}\cdot \mathbf{r}} = e^{- 2\pi i(w_{2x}x + w_{2z}z)} = e^{- 2\pi iw_{2x}x - 2\pi |w_{2z}|z}$  (transmitted wave) toward positive  $z$  (see Fig. 24- 4). This implies that in order to produce a surface wave with parallel- polarized incident light, the electrical permittivities of the two materials must have opposite signs. Since metals display negative permittivities over large parts of the spectrum, this condition is easily fulfilled. To produce a surface polariton with perpendicular- polarized light, on the other hand, requires a medium with negative magnetic permeability. While so- called negative index materials (NIM) exhibit both negative permittivity and permeability [16], most materials are nonmagnetic, for which surface polaritons cannot be generated with perpendicular- polarized light. Employing equation (2.31) together with  $m^2 = \epsilon$ , we may write for a general nonmagnetic medium

$$
\begin{array}{r}w_{1}^{2} = w_{x}^{2} + w_{1z}^{2} = \eta_{0}^{2}\epsilon_{1},\\ w_{2}^{2} = w_{x}^{2} + w_{2z}^{2} = \eta_{0}^{2}\epsilon_{2}, \end{array} \tag{24.16b}
$$

where we have made use of the fact that the tangential component of the wave vector must be continuous across the interface,  $w_{1x} = w_{2x} = w_{x}$ . Using these relations the  $z$ - components may be eliminated from equation (24.15a), leading to

$$
w_{x} = \eta_{0}\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{1}\epsilon_{2}}{\epsilon_{1} + \epsilon_{2}}}. \tag{24.17}
$$

FIGURE 24-5 Dispersion relation for aluminum and air; top left solid line: propagating waves; dashed line: light line; bottom right solid line: evanescent waves.

This equation relates the tangential component of the wave vector to wavenumber (or frequency), and is a popular alternative statement of the polariton dispersion relation. If one of the media is vacuum or air  $(\epsilon = 1)$ , an evanescent wave exists if  $w_{x} > \eta_{0}$  (i.e.,  $w_{z}$  has an imaginary component). Note that equation (24.17) also gives the roots to the numerator of equation (24.14a): for  $w_{x}< \eta_{0}$  equation (24.17) describes propagating waves.

Example 24.2. Determine the dispersion relation between aluminum and air, assuming that the dielectric function of Al obeys the Drude theory.

# Solution

The Drude equation has been given by equation (3.64), when written in complex form, as

$$
\epsilon_{\mathrm{Al}} = 1 + \frac{\nu_p^2}{\nu(\nu + i\gamma)},\quad \nu_p = 3.07\times 10^{15}\mathrm{Hz},\quad \gamma = 3.12\times 10^{13}\mathrm{Hz},
$$

with plasma frequency  $\nu_{p}$  and damping factor  $\gamma$  from Fig. 3- 7. With  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{air}} = 1$  the tangential wave vector component may be calculated from equation (24.17). Since  $\epsilon_{\mathrm{Al}}$  is complex, so is  $w_{x} = w_{x}^{\prime} + iw_{x}^{\prime \prime}$ . It is common to show a dispersion relationship by plotting the real part of  $w_{x}w_{z}$ . frequency or wavenumber, which has been done in Fig. 24- 5. The dashed line  $w_{x}^{\prime} = \eta_{0}$  is called the light line. On its left  $w_{z}$  is real in air, and a propagating wave exists. On its right,  $w_{x}^{\prime} > \eta_{0}$  and the  $w_{z}$  in air becomes imaginary, and only evanescent waves are found. It is seen that, for the evanescent waves,  $w_{z}^{\prime \prime}$  increases rapidly, reaching an asymptote at  $\nu = \nu_{p} / \sqrt{2}$ , when the real part of the dielectric function of Al approaches  $- 1$ . For  $\nu >\nu_{p}$  metal becomes transparent and the real part of the dielectric function becomes positive. The solution to equation (24.17) for  $\nu >\nu_{p}$  corresponds to  $r_{\parallel} = 0$  in equation (24.14a) and shows, therefore, propagating waves.

# 24.6 FLUCTUATIONAL ELECTRODYNAMICS

As indicated earlier, Maxwell's equations do not contain a thermal radiation emission term. Such a source must be added by considering radiative transitions by elementary energy carriers (such as electrons, lattice vibrations called phonons, etc.) from a higher energy state to a lower one, accompanied by the release of a photon. Such a quantum- mechanical process, similar to emission from gas molecules covered in Chapter 11, must be linked to the equations describing the electromagnetic waves. This is achieved through the concept of fluctuational electrodynamics, originally developed by Rytov [1,2]. At any finite temperature above absolute zero, chaotic thermal motions takes place inside any material. Charged particles of opposite sign pair up (known as dipoles), and the random motion of the dipoles induce a fluctuating electromagnetic

field. Thus, in this fluctuational electrodynamics model the random thermal fluctuations generate a space- and time- dependent (but random) electric current density  $\mathbf{j}'(\mathbf{r},t)$  inside the medium, whose time average is zero [5]. To include the stochastic current density in the electromagnetic wave equations, several approaches are possible. The most common technique is to employ a dyadic Green's function  $\mathbf{G}_e(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}',\nu)$  (a  $3\times 3$  matrix). The induced electric and magnetic fields in the frequency domain can then be determined from

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\bf E}({\bf r},\nu) = 2\pi i\mu_0\int_V{\bf G}_e({\bf r},{\bf r}',\nu)\cdot {\bf j}({\bf r}',\nu){\bf d}{\bf r}',\\ {\bf H} ({\bf r},\nu) = \int_V{\bf G}_h({\bf r},{\bf r}',\nu)\cdot {\bf j}({\bf r}',\nu){\bf d}{\bf r}', \end{array} \tag{24.18b}
$$

where the integral is over the volume, which contains the fluctuating dipoles,  $\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{r}',\nu)$  is the Fourier transform of the electric current density source  $\mathbf{j}'(\mathbf{r},t)$  into frequency space, and  $\mu_0$  is the magnetic permeability of vacuum. The dyadic Green's function for the magnetic field is, by equation (2.13), directly related to  $\mathbf{G}_e$  through  $\mathbf{G}_h = - \nabla \times \mathbf{G}_e$ . Physically,  $\mathbf{G}_e$  may be interpreted as a transfer function relating the electric field at location  $\mathbf{r}$  and frequency  $\nu$  to a vector source located at  $\mathbf{r}'$ . Mathematically, the dyadic Green's function is found as the solution to a vector Helmholtz equation, which may be reduced to a scalar one as [4]

$$
\mathbf{G}_e(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}',\nu) = \left(\delta +\frac{1}{(2\pi w)^2}\nabla \mathbf{V}\right)G_0(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}',\nu), \tag{24.19}
$$

with  $G_{0}$  the solution to

$$
\left((2\pi w)^2 +\nabla^2\right)G_0(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}',\nu) = -\delta (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'), \tag{24.20}
$$

where  $\delta (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}')$  is a 3D Dirac- delta function as defined on  $\mathbb{P}$ . 610, and  $w$  is the magnitude of the wave vector  $\mathbf{w}$ . The time- averaged emitted energy flux may be calculated from the average Poynting vector, equation (2.41),

$$
\begin{array}{r}\langle \mathbf{S}(\mathbf{r},\nu)\rangle = \frac{1}{2}\langle \mathfrak{R}\{\mathbf{E}_c\times \mathbf{H}_c^*\} \rangle , \end{array} \tag{24.21}
$$

where the angle brackets denote the ensemble average over the random fluctuations. Sticking equations (24.18) into equation (24.21) requires a two- point ensemble average of the random current density, which must be a function of local temperature. This is achieved through the fluctuation- dissipation theorem pioneered by Rytov [1], leading to

$$
\langle j_m(\mathbf{r},\nu)j_n(\mathbf{r}',\nu)\rangle = 8\nu \epsilon_0\epsilon ''\Theta (\nu ,T)\delta_{mn}\delta (\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}'), \tag{24.22}
$$

where  $\epsilon_0$  is the electrical permittivity of vacuum,  $\epsilon ''$  is the imaginary part of the medium's dielectric function, and subscripts  $m$  and  $n$  denote the  $x$ - ,  $y$ - and  $z$ - components of  $\mathbf{j}$ . The function  $\Theta (\nu ,T)$  is the mean energy of a Planck oscillator given by [4]

$$
\Theta (\nu ,T) = \frac{h\nu}{e^{h\nu / kT} - 1}. \tag{24.23}
$$

A multiplicative factor of 4 is included on the right- hand side of equation (24.22), since only positive frequencies are considered in the Fourier transform for the electric current density [17]. Sticking equations (24.18) and (24.22) into equation (24.21) yields for the individual terms arising in the Poynting vector, after some manipulation,

$$
\begin{array}{r}\frac{1}{2}\left\langle E_i(\mathbf{r},\nu)H_j^* (\mathbf{r},\nu)\right\rangle = 8\pi \left(\frac{\nu}{c_0}\right)^2\Theta (\nu ,T)\Re \left\{i\epsilon \int_V\sum_mG_{e,m}(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}',\nu)G_{e,jm}(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}',\nu)\mathbf{dr}'\right\} , \end{array} \tag{24.24}
$$

where the subscripts again denote the various  $x - , y-$  and  $z$ - components. For example, the  $z$ - component of the Poynting vector becomes

$$
\begin{array}{l}{\langle S_z(\mathbf{r},\nu)\rangle = \frac{1}{2}\left\langle E_xH_y^* -E_yH_x^*\right\rangle}\\ {= 8\pi \left(\frac{\nu}{c_0}\right)^2\Theta (\nu ,T)\Re \left\{i\epsilon \int_V\sum_m\left(G_{e,xm}G_{h,ym}^* -G_{e,ym}G_{h,xm}^*\right)(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}',\nu)\mathbf{dr}'\right\} .} \end{array} \tag{24.25}
$$

As given, the time- averaged Poynting vector constitutes the local radiative flux caused by the surrounding electromagnetic field.

# 24.7 HEAT TRANSFER BETWEEN PARALLEL PLATES

Consider Medium 1 separated from Medium 2 by a small, perfectly parallel vacuum gap of width  $d$ , as shown in Fig. 24- 6. To calculate the radiative flux between them we need to determine the normal component of the Poynting vector for the energy transmitted from Medium 1 across the gap, as well as the counter- flow from Medium 2 to 1. Since the problem is one- dimensional in the  $z$ - direction, it has no azimuthal (or  $x$ - and  $y$ - ) dependence, making the analysis a little simpler if cylindrical coordinates are employed, i.e., we define position and wave vectors as

$$
\mathbf{r} = r\hat{\mathbf{e}}_r + z\hat{\mathbf{k}},\quad \mathbf{w} = w_r\hat{\mathbf{e}}_r + w_z\hat{\mathbf{k}}. \tag{24.26}
$$

The dyadic Green's function for two semi- infinite media separated by a parallel gap may be determined from [4, 5, 18, 19]

$$
\mathbf{G}_t(r,r',z,z';\nu) = i\int_0^\infty \frac{w_x}{2w_{1z}} (\hat{\mathbf{e}}\pm \hat{\mathbf{e}}_r + \hat{\mathbf{p}}_1t_{\parallel}\hat{\mathbf{p}}_2)e^{-2\pi i(w_2z - w_{1z}z')}e^{-2\pi iw_x(r - r')}dz_{x}, \tag{24.27a}
$$

where

$$
\begin{array}{r}\dot{\mathbf{s}} = \hat{\mathbf{e}}_r\times \hat{\mathbf{k}},\quad \hat{\mathbf{p}}_i = (w_x\hat{\mathbf{k}} -w_{iz}\hat{\mathbf{e}}_r) / w_i,\quad i = 1,2. \end{array} \tag{24.27b}
$$

Here  $t_\perp$  and  $t_{\parallel}$  are the transmission coefficients from Medium 1 to Medium 2, as evaluated from Airy's formula, equation (2.131b), and the interrelationship between  $w_{x},w_{iz},$  and  $w_{i}$  is given by equation (24.16). Sticking this into equation (24.25) one obtains, after considerable algebra, for the spectral radiative flux from Medium 1 to Medium 2

$$
q_{\nu ,1\to 2} = 8\pi \Theta (\nu ,T_1)\int_0^\infty Z_{12}(\nu ,w_x)w_xdw_x \tag{24.28a}
$$

where

$$
Z_{12}(\nu ,w_x) = \frac{4\Re\{w_{1z}\}\Re\{w_{2z}\}\left|w_0^2e^{-2iw_0d}\right|}{\left|(w_{0z} + w_{1z})(w_{0z} + w_{1z})(1 - r_{\perp 01}r_{\perp 02}e^{-2iw_0d})\right|^2} +\frac{4\Re\left\{\epsilon_1w_{1z}^*\right\}\Re\left\{\epsilon_2w_{2z}^*\right\}\left|w_0^2e^{-2iw_0d}\right|}{\left|(\epsilon_1w_{0z} + w_{1z})(\epsilon_2w_{0z} + w_{1z})(1 - r_{||01}r_{||02}e^{-2iw_0d})\right|^2}. \tag{24.28b}
$$

The  $Z_{12}(\nu ,w_x)$  may be interpreted as an exchange function, identifying the contribution of a given tangential wave vector component,  $w_{x}$  (related to incidence angle), to the spectral flux. Observing that  $Z_{12} = Z_{21}$ , the net heat exchange between the two surfaces is readily found, after integration over all frequencies, as

$$
q_{\mathrm{net}} = \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(q_{\nu ,1\to 2} - q_{\nu ,2\to 1}\right)d\nu = \int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\Theta (\nu ,T_{1}) - \Theta (\nu ,T_{2})\right)\int_{0}^{\infty}Z_{12}(\nu ,w_{x})w_{x}dw_{x}d\nu. \tag{24.29}
$$

Equations (24.28) and (24.29) include contributions from both propagating and evanescent waves. We observed in Section 24.3 that we have propagating waves for  $w_{x}< w_{0} = \eta_{0} = \nu /c_{0}$  (real  $w_{0z}$  in the vacuum layer), and evanescent waves for  $w_{x} > \nu /c_{0}$  (imaginary  $w_{0z}$ ). Using the expressions for transmission coefficients developed in Section 24.4, we find

$$
Z_{\mathrm{prop}}(\nu ,w_x) = \frac{(1 - r_{\perp 01}^2)(1 - r_{\perp 02}^2)}{4\left|1 - r_{\perp 01}r_{\perp 02}e^{-2iw_0d}\right|^2} +\frac{(1 - r_{||01}^2)(1 - r_{||02}^2)}{4\left|1 - r_{||01}r_{||02}e^{-2iw_0d}\right|^2},w_x< \eta_0. \tag{24.30a}
$$

For the evanescent waves the exchange function reduces to

$$
Z_{\mathrm{evan}}(\nu ,w_x) = \frac{\Im\left\{\nu_{r_{\perp 01}}\right\}\Im\left\{r_{\perp 02}\right\}e^{-2iw_0ld}}{\left|1 - r_{\perp 01}r_{\perp 02}e^{-2iw_0ld}\right|^2} +\frac{\Im\left\{r_{||01}\right\}\Im\left\{r_{||02}\right\}e^{-2iw_0ld}}{\left|1 - r_{||01}r_{||02}e^{-2iw_0ld}\right|^2},w_x > \eta_0. \tag{24.30b}
$$

Clearly, similar to the evanescent transmissivity of Section 24.3, the contribution from  $Z_{\mathrm{evan}}$  to the flux decreases exponentially with distance between the plates.

Far Field Heat Flux. As discussed in Section 2.5, as  $d$  becomes large,  $d\gg \lambda_0$ , the radiation will lose coherence, and the gap transmissivity will obey equation (2.133) (with  $\kappa = 0$  for the vacuum gap). Then the exchange function reduces to, with  $|r|^2 = \rho$ ,

$$
Z_{\mathrm{prop,ff}}(\nu ,w_x) = \frac{(1 - \rho_{\perp 01})(1 - \rho_{\perp 02})}{4(1 - \rho_{\perp 01}\rho_{\perp 02})} +\frac{(1 - \rho_{||01})(1 - \rho_{||02})}{4(1 - \rho_{||01}\rho_{||02})}. \tag{24.31}
$$

Integration over  $w_{x}$  may be replaced by  $w_{x} = (\nu /c_{0})\sin \theta$ , where  $\theta$  is the polar angle in vacuum, and equation (24.29) becomes, with  $Z_{\mathrm{evan}} = 0$  and  $1 - \rho = \epsilon$ ,

$$
q_{\mathrm{net,far}} = \frac{2\pi}{c_0^2}\int_0^\infty [\Theta (\nu ,T_1) - \Theta (\nu ,T_2)]\int_0^{\pi /2}\left(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_{\perp 01}} + \frac{1}{\epsilon_{\perp 02}} - 1} +\frac{1}{\frac{1}{\epsilon_{||01}} + \frac{1}{\epsilon_{||02}} - 1}\right)\cos \theta \sin \theta d\theta \nu^2 d\nu . \tag{24.32}
$$

Comparison with equation (5.35) shows that these results are identical if the emissivities are assumed to be gray and diffuse.

Example 24.3. Determine the total radiative flux between two plates of aluminum, separated by a vacuum gap, assuming that the dielectric function of Al obeys the Drude theory as in the previous example. The plates are isothermal and maintained at  $400\mathrm{K}$  and  $300\mathrm{K}$ , respectively. Determine the

total radiative flux as a function of gap thickness. Distinguish contributions from propagating and evanescent waves, and compare the influence of parallel and perpendicular polarizations.

# Solution

With the dielectric function of Al given in the previous example, and with the  $w_{\mathrm{iz}}$  related to  $w_{x}$  and  $\epsilon_{i}$  by equation (24.16), the reflection coefficients in equations (24.30) may be calculated from equations (24.14). Integrating over all frequencies  $\nu$  and all tangential wave vectors  $w_{x}$ , separately  $0 \leq w_{x} < \eta_{0}$  for propagating waves, and  $\eta_{0} < w_{x} < \infty$  for evanescent waves, yields the desired total radiative flux between the two aluminum plates, as shown in Fig. 24- 7 for gap widths ranging from  $1 \mathrm{~nm}$  to  $10 \mu \mathrm{m}$ . For the far- field solution equation (24.30a) is replaced by equation (24.31) and  $Z_{\mathrm{evan}} = 0$ . Integration may again be over tangential wave vectors  $0 \leq w_{x} < \eta_{0}$  or, alternatively, over polar angle  $\theta$ . It is seen that, for gap sizes of less than about  $2 \mu \mathrm{m}$ , the heat flux is dominated by the evanescent waves, in particular its TE component. For small gap widths the propagating component approaches an asymptotic limit, which is about an order of magnitude larger than the far- field solution, but still considerably smaller than the blackbody limit of  $\sigma (T_{1}^{4} - T_{2}^{4}) = 992 \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{m}^{2}$  (due to the small emissivity of aluminum, see Fig. 3- 7).

The plasma frequency of aluminum corresponds to a wavelength slightly less than  $0.1 \mu \mathrm{m}$ , while heat transfer at the example's temperatures occurs at wavelengths between roughly 2.5 and  $60 \mu \mathrm{m}$ . Therefore, the spectral variations in heat flux essentially follow a Planck function pattern. Silicon carbide, on the other hand, has a band around  $12 \mu \mathrm{m}$  (see Fig. 3- 13), giving rise to interesting spectral variations.

Example 24.4. Determine the spectral radiative flux between two plates of silicon carbide, separated by a  $10 \mathrm{~nm}$  vacuum gap, assuming that the dielectric function of SiC obeys the Lorentz model with parameters given by Fig. 3- 13. The plates are again isothermal and maintained at  $400 \mathrm{~K}$  and  $300 \mathrm{~K}$ , respectively. Distinguish contributions from propagating and evanescent waves, as well as the influence of parallel and perpendicular polarizations, and compare with the far- field solution.

# Solution

As noted in Chapter 3, the dielectric function of SiC is well- described by the single oscillator Lorentz model of equation (3.63), with  $\epsilon_{0} = 6.7$ ,  $\nu_{pi} = 4.327 \times 10^{13} \mathrm{~Hz}$ ,  $\nu_{i} = 2.380 \times 10^{13} \mathrm{~Hz}$  (corresponding to a wavenumber of  $793 \mathrm{~cm}^{- 1}$ ), and  $\gamma_{i} = 1.428 \times 10^{11} \mathrm{~Hz}$ . Aside from the different dielectric function

FIGURE 24-8 Spectral radiative heat fluxes between silicon carbide plates separated by a  $10\mathrm{nm}$  vacuum microgap.

and the fixed gap width, the solution proceeds as in the previous example, but without carrying out the actual integration over frequency. Results are shown in Fig. 24- 8 for the spectral region between  $600\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  and  $2,000\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  surrounding the resonance band of SiC. It is seen that the TE evanescent wave has a maximum at the resonance frequency of  $793\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$ , before dropping by several orders of magnitude similar to the propagating waves. On the other hand, the TM evanescent wave has a maximum at  $969\mathrm{cm}^{- 1}$  (corresponding to the wavelength with near- zero reflectivity in Fig. 3- 13). The far- field flux follows the behavior given in Fig. 3- 13, i.e., flux decreases over wavelengths with large reflectivities.

A number of researchers have investigated near- field radiative transfer theoretically, primarily looking at different aspects of the heat flow across plane- parallel gaps [17, 20- 26]. Other geometries that have also received attention are spheres in close contact with flat plates [18, 19, 27], and with another sphere [28- 31].

# 24.8 EXPERIMENTS ON NANOSCALE RADIATION

It has been recognized for some time that radiative heat transfer can exceed blackbody limits at the nanoscale, and thus plays an important role in a number of applications, such as near- field microscopy, nanoelectronics thermal management, photovoltaics, etc. Correspondingly, the problem of heat transfer between closely spaced objects has been studied theoretically in some detail, as outlined in the previous sections. On the other hand, experimental verification has been limited, mostly because of the difficulties of maintaining a precise nanoscale gap between the emitter and receiver. The earliest experiments were carried out in the field of cryogenic insulation by Domoto and coworkers [32] (accompanied by some theoretical attempts [20, 21]), and by Hargreaves [33, 34]. At cryogenic temperatures, say below  $10\mathrm{K}$ , according to Wien's displacement law, equation (1.16), heat transfer is maximized around a wavelength of  $300\mu \mathrm{m}$ , i.e., even plates tens of  $\mu \mathrm{m}$  apart should display tunneling effects. Domoto and coworkers measured heat flow between two copper plates as close as  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$  together, and at temperatures between  $5\mathrm{K}$  and  $15\mathrm{K}$ . While the measured heat transfer was only about  $3\%$  of that between blackbodies (because of copper's small emittance), and agreement with their model was only fair, they were able to show that—contrary to far- field analysis—the heat transfer increased

by a factor of 2.3 between the far field and their closest spacing of  $10\mu \mathrm{m}$ . Hargreaves carried out similar experiments, using chromium plates with vacuum gaps down to  $1.5\mu \mathrm{m}$ . He was able to demonstrate a factor of five heat transfer increase from far field to near field (but still considerably less than the blackbody limit).

Small gaps are more easily achieved by moving a small tip close to a surface. For example, Xu et al. [35] tried to measure near- field radiative transfer by moving a  $100\mu \mathrm{m}$  diameter indium probe of a scanning thermal microscope as close as  $12\mathrm{nm}$  to a thermocouple probe, but could not detect any substantial increase in heat transfer. Kittel and colleagues [36] used a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) to measure near- field radiation between the thermocouple tip and a plate, observing the expected  $1 / d^3$  increase in heat transfer down to a gap width of  $10\mathrm{nm}$ . Below that distance, there was disagreement between theory and experiment. Narayanaswamy et al. [27] measured near- field radiation with a bimetallic atomic force microscope (AFM) cantilever with a silica microsphere at its tip. The plate was heated to maintain a temperature difference with the sphere, leading to near- field radiative transfer rates in the order of nW, which was measured by monitoring the deflection of the bimetallic cantilever. Their measurements confirmed that the near- field radiation between the flat surface and the microsphere was more than two orders of magnitude larger than between blackbodies, with a  $1 / d$ - dependence.

Successful measurements between parallel plates have been carried out by Hu and coworkers [27]. They employed two precise optical glass flats spaced a fixed  $1.6\mu \mathrm{m}$  apart by using polystyrene spacer beads. Applying various temperature differences they measured heat transfer rates approximately  $35\%$  higher than the blackbody limit, and observed good agreement with theoretical predictions. Very recently, Ottens et al. [37] carried out high- precision heat transfer measurements between two sapphire plates spaced a variable distance as little as  $2\mu \mathrm{m}$  apart. They also used cryogenic temperatures to emphasize near- field effects. Figure 24- 9 shows the pertinent results of their experiments, compared with theoretical results from equation (24.29), displayed in the form of a heat transfer coefficient, i.e.,  $h_r = q_{\mathrm{net}} / (T_1 - T_2)$ . Agreement between theory and experiment is good, except for a slight systematic error, which may be due to imperfect flatness of the plates, as demonstrated by the dashed lines, which correspond to near- field radiative heat transfer between two convex plates, each having a radius of curvature of  $\simeq 1\mathrm{km}$ . Note that the highest heat transfer coefficient measured,  $8.5\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{K}$  for the  $\Delta T = 6.8\mathrm{K}$  case, exceeds the blackbody limit of  $\sigma (T_1^4 - T_2^4) / (T_1 - T_2)\simeq 6.7\mathrm{W} / \mathrm{m}^2\mathrm{K}$ .

# APPENDIX B

# TABLES FOR RADIATIVE PROPERTIES OF OPAQUE SURFACES

In this appendix, tables of total normal emittances, as well as a number of total normal solar absorptances, are given. The data have been collected from several surveys [1- 8] that, in turn, have assembled their data from a multitude of references dating back all the way into the 1920s. As seen from the tables, there can sometimes be considerable differences in total emittance for ostensibly the same material, as reported by different researchers. While these discrepancies are partially due to varying accuracy, the primary reason is, as outlined in Chapter 3, the fact that surface layers, surface roughness, oxidation, etc., strongly affect the emittance of materials. Therefore, it should be realized that the total normal emittance or absorptance of a given surface may, in actuality, differ considerably from these reported values.In estimating the total hemispherical emittance from total normal data, one should keep in mind that:

In estimating the total hemispherical emittance from total normal data, one should keep in mind that:

1. Materials with high emittance tend to behave like dielectrics, resulting in a hemispherical emittance that is  $3\%$  to  $5\%$  smaller than the normal one (cf. Fig. 3-19).2. Materials with low emittance tend to behave like metals, resulting in hemispherical emittances that may be up to  $25\%$  larger than normal ones (cf. Fig. 3-9).

# VIEW FACTOR CATALOGUE

In this appendix a small number of view factor relations and figures are presented. A much larger collection from a variety of references has been compiled by Howell [1, 2], from which the present list has been extracted. The latest edition of this collection can be accessed on the Internet via http://www.engr.uky.edu/FL/Catalog/. View factors for all configurations given in this appendix, as well as those between two arbitrarily orientated rectangular plates lying in perpendicular planes, as given by equations (4.41) and (4.42), can be calculated with the stand- alone program viewfactors (prompting for user input) or from within another program through calls to Fortran function view, both given in Appendix F. A number of commercial and noncommercial computer programs are available for the evaluation of more complicated view factors [3- 13]. A list of papers and monographs that either deal with evaluation methods for view factors, or present results for specified configurations (ordered by date of publication) is also given. No attempt at completeness has been made.Note: In all expressions in which inverse trigonometric functions appear, the principal value is to be taken; i.e., for any argument  $\xi$ ,

# EXPONENTIAL INTEGRAL FUNCTIONS

The exponential integral functions  $E_{n}(x)$  and their derivatives occur frequently in radiative heat transfer calculations; therefore, a summary of their properties as well as a brief tabulation are given here. More detailed discussions of their properties may be found in the books by Chandrasekhar [1] and Kourganoff [2], or in mathematical handbooks such as [3]. Detailed tabulations are given in [3], and formulae for their numerical evaluation are listed in [3, 4].

The exponential integral of order  $n$  is defined as

$$
E_{n}(x) = \int_{1}^{\infty}e^{-xt}\frac{dt}{t^{n}},\quad n = 0,1,2,\ldots , \tag{E.1}
$$

or, setting  $\mu = 1 / t$

$$
E_{n}(x) = \int_{0}^{1}e^{-x / \mu}\mu^{n - 2}d\mu ,\quad n = 0,1,2,\ldots . \tag{E.2}
$$

Differentiating equation (E.1), a first recurrence relationship is found as

$$
\frac{dE_{n}}{dx} (x) = -E_{n - 1}(x),\quad n = 1,2,\ldots , \tag{E.3}
$$

where

$$
E_{0}(x) = \int_{1}^{\infty}e^{-xt}dt = \frac{e^{-x}}{x}. \tag{E.4}
$$

A second recurrence is found by integrating equation (E.3), or

$$
\int_{x}^{\infty}E_{n}(x)dx = E_{n + 1}(x),\quad n = 0,1,2,\ldots . \tag{E.5}
$$

An algebraic recurrence between consecutive orders may be obtained by integrating equation (E.1) by parts, or

$$
E_{n + 1}(x) = \frac{1}{n}\left[e^{-x} - xE_n(x)\right],\quad n = 1,2,3,\ldots . \tag{E.6}
$$

The integral of equation (E.1) may be solved in a general series expansion as [3]

$$
E_{n}(x) = \frac{(-x)^{n - 1}}{(n - 1)!} (\psi_{n} - \ln x) + \sum_{m = 0\atop m\neq n - 1}^{\infty}\frac{(-x)^{m}}{m!(n - 1 - m)},\quad n = 1,2,3,\ldots , \tag{E.7a}
$$

where

$$
\psi_{n} = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} - \gamma_{E}, & n = 1,\\ -\gamma_{E} + \sum_{m = 1}^{n - 1}\frac{1}{m}, & n\geq 2, \end{array} \right. \tag{E.7b}
$$

and

$$
\gamma_{E} = \int_{1}^{\infty}\left(1 - e^{-t}\right)\frac{dt}{t} = 0.577216\ldots \tag{E.7c}
$$

is known as Euler's constant. Substituting values for  $n$ , one obtains

$$
\begin{array}{l}{E_1(x) = -(\gamma_E + \ln x) + x - \frac{x^2}{2!2} +\frac{x^3}{3!3} -\frac{x^4}{4!4} + - \ldots ,}\\ {E_2(x) = 1 + x(\gamma_E - 1 + \ln x) - \frac{x^2}{2!1} +\frac{x^3}{3!2} -\frac{x^4}{4!3} + - \ldots ,}\\ {E_3(x) = \frac{1}{2} -x + \frac{x^2}{2}\left(-\gamma_E + \frac{3}{2} -\ln x\right) + \frac{x^3}{3!1} -\frac{x^4}{4!2} + - \ldots .} \end{array} \tag{E.10}
$$

A function related to  $E_{1}$  that often occurs in radiation calculations is

$$
\begin{array}{l}\operatorname {Ein}(x) = \int_0^1\left(1 - e^{-xt}\right)\frac{dt}{t} = \int_0^\infty \left(1 - e^{-xe^{-\xi}}\right)d\xi \\ = E_1(x) + \ln x + \gamma_E = x - \frac{x^2}{2!2} +\frac{x^3}{3!3} - + \ldots . \end{array} \tag{E.11}
$$

For vanishing values of  $x$  it follows from equation (E.7), or directly integrating equation (E.1), that

$$
\begin{array}{l}{E_n(0) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} + \infty , & n = 1,\\ \displaystyle \frac{1}{n - 1}, & n\geq 2, \end{array} \right.}\\ {\mathrm{Ein}(0) = 0.} \end{array} \tag{E.12b}
$$

For large values of  $x$ , the asymptotic expansion for the exponential integrals is given by [3]

$$
E_{n}(x) = \frac{e^{-x}}{x}\left[1 - \frac{n}{x} +\frac{n(n + 1)}{x^{2}} -\frac{n(n + 1)(n + 2)}{x^{3}} +\ldots \right],\quad n = 0,1,2,\ldots . \tag{E.13}
$$

To estimate the relative magnitude of different orders of exponential integrals, the following inequalities are sometimes handy [3]:

$$
\begin{array}{l}\frac{n - 1}{n} E_n(x)< E_{n + 1}(x)< E_n(x),\quad n = 1,2,3,\ldots ,\\ \displaystyle \frac{1}{x + n} < e^x E_n(x)\leq \frac{1}{x + n - 1},\quad n = 1,2,3,\ldots . \end{array} \tag{E.15}
$$

# COMPUTER CODES

This appendix contains a listing and brief description of a number of computer programs that may be helpful to the reader of this book, and that can be downloaded from its dedicated website located at http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780123869449. Some of the codes are very basic and are entirely intended to aid the reader with the solution to the problems given at the end of the more basic chapters. Some of the codes were born out of research, but are basic enough to aid a graduate student with more complicated assignments or a semester project. And a few programs are so sophisticated in nature that they will be useful only to the practicing engineer conducting his or her own research. Finally, it is anticipated that the website will be kept up- to- date and augmented once in a while. Thus, there may be a few additional programs not described in this appendix.

It is a fact that most engineers have done, and still do, their programming in Fortran, and the author of this book is no exception. It is also true that computer scientists and most commercial programmers do their work in  $\mathbf{C} + +$  ; more importantly, the younger generation of engineers at many universities across the U.S. are now also learning  $\mathbf{C} + +$  .Both compiled languages have in recent years been trumped by MATLAB@ [1], which- while an interpreted rather than compiled language- - has many convenient mathematical and graphical tools. Since all the programs in this listing were written by the author, either for research purposes or for the creation of this book, they all started their life in Fortran (older programs as Fortran77, and the later ones as Fortran90). However, as a gesture toward the  $\mathbf{C} + +$  and MATLAB@ communities, the most basic codes have all been converted to  $\mathbf{C} + +$  as well as MATLAB, as indicated below by the program suffixes .cpp and .m. If desired, all other programs are easily converted with freeware translators such as f2c (resulting in somewhat clumsy, but functional codes). Finally, self- contained programs that have been precompiled for Microsoft Windows have the suffix . exe.

The programs are listed in order by chapter in which they first appear. More detailed descriptions, sometimes with an example, can be found on the website. Third- party codes that are also provided at the website are listed at the end.
