Keywords: Soil temperature Soil heat flux Damping depth Air temperature Global radiation Root-knot nematode

A 27-year soil temperature record at five depths and soil heat flux record at one depth were analyzed for a grassland area in The Netherlands. The annual mean soil temperature of the last 23 years of soil measurements (no data gaps) showed a statistically significant increase of about $1 . 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } } _ { \cdot }$ consistent with the observed air temperature increase of about $1 . 3 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ for the same period. This positive trend correlates well with global brightening of $5 . 3 \mathsf { W } \mathsf { m } ^ { - 2 }$ per decade. The 10-day mean soil temperature varied smoothly throughout the year with relatively small inter-annual variability. The deeper the measurement depth, the smoother the annual cycle and the smaller the variability. In February and at the end of the year the variability appears to be somewhat larger. A Fast Fourier Transform was applied to the measurements and revealed an annual and daily damping depth of $1 . 8 0 \mathrm { m }$ and $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { m }$ , respectively. An example of the usefulness of this data is provided for agriculture, where an aggressive root-knot nematode is affected by the mean soil temperature increase. It appears that the 600 degree day life-cycle threshold is reached 16 days earlier, which may lead to a potential serious increase in agriculture crop damage.

# 1. Introduction

Soil temperature controls biological and biochemical processes in the soil which, in turn, affects soil organic matter formation, fertilizer efficiency, seed germination, plant development, plant winter survival and disease and insect occurrence (Smith et al., 1964). Soil temperatures affect numerous ecosystem processes including the dynamics of soil organisms, plant root growth, seed germination, nutrient uptake and decomposition. In addition, soil temperature behaviour plays an especially important role in crop variety selection and farm management practices (Ping, 1987). Hence it is important to have a good insight into soil temperature behaviour and to apply this knowledge, for example, to soil–plant atmosphere models.

In the light of discussions on global warming, there is an increasing interest in ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ budgets of various ecosystems. The ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ budget of an ecosystem consists of two main terms; the Gross Primary Production or assimilation term, which is an uptake term, and the Ecosystem Respiration term, which is a release term. In grassland regions, this release term is mainly caused by heterotrophic microbial decomposition and plant root respiration (Norman et al., 1992), and the release term is highly soil temperature dependent (Lloyd and Taylor, 1994; Jacobs et al., 2007). Consequently, changes in soil temperature directly affect this ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ release term and ultimately the total ${ \mathsf { C O } } _ { 2 }$ budget.

In micrometeorological literature, the basic transport equations of heat and water in soils have been discussed comprehensively. Examples of well-known textbooks covering these items are those by Van Wijk (1963), De Vries (1975), Monteith and Unsworth (1990), Campbell and Norman (1998) and Hillel (1998). Concerning heat transport, the daily cycle of soil temperatures at various depths and soil heat fluxes have also been thoroughly studied in outdoor measurements for various soil types. However, typically little attention is given to characteristics of the annual cycles of soil temperatures and fluxes and their inter-annual differences. This is a serious shortcoming since most ecological and biological processes are affected by seasonal differences. In addition, it is of interest to study inter-annual differences and changes related to the warming atmosphere.

In the literature, there are a limited number of long-term soil temperature and soil heat flux measurements available. In general, these studies were carried out for 1 or 2 years for soil-related applications. For example, Wu and Nofziger (1999) studied the effect of soil temperature on pesticide degradation rate. Changnon (1999) investigated a very long one-point soil temperature record (64 years) that clearly showed the growing heat island effect in a rural Illinois area. Baker and Baker (2002) analyzed a 35-year soil data set to investigate the heat island effect on the soil energy budget. Johnson-Maynard et al. (2004), in a pedogenesis study, investigated the soil microclimate under various tree stands over a 2-year period. Li et al. (2009) studied the energy and water budgets of the Upper Yellow River area during two consecutive years.

The Wageningen ‘Haarweg’ meteorological site, situated in a grassland region in The Netherlands, has a 27 years continuous record of soil temperatures at five depths and soil heat flux at one depth measured at the same spot. For both ecological and agricultural reasons, it was interesting to analyse this data record to find typical characteristics of this particular soil thermal environment. This analysis is the main objective of the present study. It was also interesting to check if the reported “brightening effect” of solar radiation in the last decades (Wild, 2009; Jacobs et al., 2009) has affected the thermal soil behaviour. An application of the data to agriculture is provided.

# 2. Materials and methods

Since 1980, Wageningen University has operated a meteorological observatory, the Haarweg Station, in the centre of Netherlands (lat. $5 1 ^ { \circ } 5 8 ^ { \prime } \mathsf { N }$ , long. $5 ^ { \circ } 3 8 ^ { \prime } \mathsf { W }$ , altitude 7 msl; www.met.wau.nl), with sensors for measuring soil heat fluxes and temperatures. The region has perennial grassland with the dominant plant species consisting of Lolium perenne and Poa trivialis. The grass cover is mowed weekly, has a mean height of $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { m }$ and a mean Leaf Area Index, LAI, of 2.9 (Snel, 2004). The LAI of the grass cover was estimated with a Digital Plant Canopy Imager (CID Bio-Science, USA, type CI110, version 1). The soil at the site is predominantly heavy basin clay resulting from the back-swamps of the Rhine River.

The Haarweg observatory is an agro-meteorological station where all energy flux components are measured near the surface. More details about the station can be found elsewhere (Jacobs et al., 2008). An aspirated psychrometer equipped with two Pt-100 temperature sensing elements measures the air temperature, $T _ { a }$ , and air humidity, $T _ { w }$ , at reference height $z _ { r } = 1 . 5  { \mathrm { m } }$ inside a Stevenson screen. There is a second Stevenson screen including a similar but non-aspirated psychrometer for backup. At $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { m }$ height, the grass temperature $T _ { a }$ is measured with a shielded Pt-100 thermometer (home-made). The incoming $( R _ { s h } )$ short-wave radiation is measured with an aspirated pyranometer (Kipp & Zonen, model CM11).

Soil temperatures, $T _ { s }$ , were measured with Pt-100 elements at depths 0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50 and $1 . 0 \mathrm { m }$ . The thermometers were installed along a plastic plate and the top of this plate is exactly at the soil surface to enable visual inspection. The soil heat flux is measured by a heat plate (TNO, WS 31-Cp, accuracy $5 \%$ ) buried at a depth of $7 5 \mathrm { m m }$ . To ensure proper placement, regular depth checks are preformed by inserting a thin metal rod into the soil to measure its depth. The measured soil heat fluxes are corrected for instrumental shape correction, $\boldsymbol { \phi }$ , for soil heat flux sensors as proposed by Mogensen (1970):

$$
\phi = \frac { 1 } { 1 - 1 . 7 t A ^ { - 0 . 5 } ( 1 - \varepsilon ^ { - 1 } ) }
$$

Here $t$ is the thickness of the plate, $A$ is the area of the plate and $\varepsilon$ is the ratio between the thermal conductivity of the plate to that of the soil. The soil heat flux at the surface is the measured soil heat flux at depth $z _ { p }$ plus a heat storage term (Fritschen and Gay, 1979):

$$
G ( 0 ) = G ( z _ { p } ) - C _ { s } \int _ { 0 } ^ { z _ { p } } \frac { \delta T } { \delta t } d z
$$

where $C _ { s }$ is the volumetric heat capacity soil.

For a homogeneous soil, an analytical solution of the soil temperature at depth $z$ can be calculated by solving the soil heat budget equation (Van Wijk, 1963):

$$
\frac { \partial T _ { s } } { \partial t } = \kappa \frac { \partial ^ { 2 } T _ { s } } { \partial z ^ { 2 } }
$$

where $T _ { s } \left( ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C } \right)$ is the soil temperature and $\kappa ( \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 } s ^ { - 1 } )$ is the soil thermal diffusivity. A Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis was applied to the analytical solution and soil temperature measurements. By varying the soil thermal diffusivity, $\kappa$ , the model and measurements results can be fitted. Next, the soil heat flux, $\mathsf { Q } _ { s } ( z ) ( \mathsf { W } \mathsf { m } ^ { - 2 } )$ can be calculated (Van Wijk, 1963):

$$
Q _ { s } ( z ) = - \lambda \frac { \partial T _ { s } } { \partial z }
$$

where  $( \mathsf { W } \mathsf { m } ^ { - 1 } \mathsf { K } ^ { - 1 } )$ is the soil heat conductivity. By varying $\lambda$ , the soil heat flux model results and measurements at $z = 0 . 0 7 5 \mathrm { m }$ can be fitted. The advantage of this technique is that an estimate of the soil heat flux can be made at the surface $( Q _ { s } ( 0 ) = - \lambda (  { \partial } T _ { s } ( 0 ) /  { \partial } z ) )$ . A detailed description of this analysis technique is given by Heusinkveld et al. (2004).

All thermometers were calibrated against a NIST traceable reference thermometer (accuracy 0.02 K). A stable reference resistor was included in the measurement cycle to have an independent test of the quality of the datalogging. Although the temperature sensors remain inside the soil without re-calibration, as this would interrupt the measurements, there are several reasons to assume a sensor drift less than 0.1 K. Platinum wire resistance thermometers are extremely stable over time. An external influence that is known to change the calibration of platinium wire resistance thermometers is shock. This mainly affects the offset (and has a far smaller effect on sensitivity) and, since the thermometers are buried, this should not be an issue causing a temperature drift. In addition, Pt100 platinum resistance wire is thicker than the popular Pt-1000. A thicker wire gives a more stable thermometer but reduces sensitivity. Sensitivity is not an issue in low drift measurements with an accuracy of ${ < } 0 . 1 \mathrm { K }$ . The same thermometers are also used for the two psychrometers and those have been recalibrated at regular intervals (about 7 years); their drift was almost undetectable $( \ll 0 . 1 \mathrm { K } )$ . It is interesting to note that the annual average of the aspirated and non-aspirated thermometers are $< 0 . 0 2 \mathrm { K }$ .

# 3. Results and discussion

Soil temperature and soil flux measurements started at the Haarweg station in 1980, however the first 2 years are not used in this analysis because the sensors had to settle in the soil. As the winter temperature measurements of 1983, 1984 and 1986 have large data gaps, it was decided to limit the annual temperature analysis to the 1987–2009 period. However, the missing months would not affect the temperature sum analysis in Section 4, below, thus these 3 years were included. Global radiation measurements had no data gaps but air temperature data showed a one week gap at the end of March 1992. Temperature data of a nearby weather station was used as a substitute. In light of climatic change, it was interesting to determine if a trend in the mean soil temperatures could be observed during the gapless measurement period (1987–2009). In Fig. 1 the annual mean temperatures at five depths are displayed along with their mean value of the soil temperature profile. The linear trend line through the mean values was plotted as well in Fig. 1, which results in $T _ { s . m } = 0 . 0 4 4 Y + 1 0 . 7$ with a correlation coefficient of $r ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 5$ (number of points: 23). The ANOVA regression statistics (trend $0 . 0 4 4 \pm 0 . 0 1 7$ and $p$ -value $_ { = 0 . 0 1 5 }$ ) show that this trend is significant. This also means that the mean soil temperature increased by $1 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ during the gapless measurement period, or about $0 . 4 4 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ per decade. This is significant and likely influences many biological soil processes such as the Nematode life cycle. Baker and Ruschy (1993) and Baker and Baker (2002) also found a significant increase of the annual mean soil temperature in eastern Minnesota.

It is of interest to relate the significant increase in soil temperature of $0 . 4 4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ per decade to other variables. In fact soil temperatures are normally impacted by the surface characteristics and turbulent and radiative energy balance budgets in which incoming solar radiation, temperature, wind speed and other variables are relevant. Here we relate the soil temperatures to global radiation and air temperature, as observed for our experimental site (Fig. 2) (Jacobs et al., 2009). In the top panel of Fig. 2 the measured annual mean global radiation $( R _ { g l . m } )$ is displayed together with its trend during the last 30 years. The linear trend results in $R _ { g l . m } = 0 . 5 3 Y + 1 0 1 . 6 \mathrm { W } \mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ with a correlation coefficient of $r ^ { 2 } = 0 . { \ddot { 3 } } 8$ , which means an increase of $5 . 3 \mathsf { W } \mathsf { m } ^ { - 2 }$ per decade. The ANOVA regression statistics (trend $= 0 . 5 3 \pm 0 . 2 7$ and $p$ -value $= 2 . 6 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 } ,$ ) show that this trend is significant. In the bottom panel of Fig. 2, the air temperatures at $1 . 5 \mathrm { m }$ and $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { m }$ have been plotted together with their trends and correlation coefficients. The linear trend results in $T _ { a } ( 1 . 5 \ : \mathrm { m } ) = 0 . 0 5 7 Y + 9 . 1 \ : ^ { \circ } \mathrm { C }$ with a correlation coefficient of $r ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4 3$ , which means an increase of $0 . 6 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ per decade. At $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { m }$ , $T _ { a } ( 0 . 1 \ \mathrm { m } ) = 0 . 0 4 0 Y + 9 . 4 \ ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ with a correlation coefficient of $r ^ { 2 } = 0 . 2 7$ , which means an increase of $0 . 4 ^ { \circ } \mathsf C$ per decade. The ANOVA regression statistics (trend $= 0 . 0 5 6 \pm 0 . 0 1 2$ , $p -$ value $= 8 . 3 \times 1 0 ^ { - 5 }$ for the $1 . 5 \mathrm { m }$ level and $0 . 0 4 0 { \scriptstyle \pm 0 . 0 1 2 }$ , $3 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ for the $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { m }$ level, respectively), show that these trends are significant. In a recent overview on global dimming and brightening and their effect on air temperature, Wild (2009) found a similar trend (seven sites in Germany: $4 . 6 \mathsf { W } \mathsf { m } ^ { - 2 }$ decade−1, period: 1985–2005). See also Ohmura (2006) for more background information.

Fig. 3 contains the annual mean distribution per monthly decade of the five soil temperatures and the annual mean air temperature at $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { m }$ height. The standard deviations have been plotted in Fig. 3. It is interesting to note that the deeper the soil temperature measurement, the smoother the soil temperature distribution. This must be expected since the higher harmonics are damped best with depth. Accordingly, the standard deviations decrease with depth, which is clearly seen in Fig. 3. An interesting feature, particularly in the lower soil regions, is that the standard deviation around February is much larger than for January or March. This is because in February The Netherlands can have either a cold month with a high chance of snow cover or a relatively warm month. Such large standard deviations also occur for November/December.

In order to obtain an insight into the mean soil temperature profiles, the annual mean soil temperatures together with their mean annual maximum and mean annual minimum temperatures have been plotted in Fig. 4. From the centre panel of Fig. 4, the annual mean soil temperature profile is more or less constant with depth, although the variances are high and decrease somewhat with depth. This implies that the inter-annual differences must be high. In Fig. 4 the mean maximum temperature profile decreases with depth and the mean minimum temperature profile increases with depth and this is a function of soil thermal properties which will be discussed next. In addition, the variances of the maximum and minimum profiles are high and decrease somewhat with depth.

A Fourier analysis was applied to the soil heat budget equation (Eq. (3)). By varying the soil thermal diffusivity, the soil temperature observations and the model calculations have been optimized. The observed and calculated soil temperature results are displayed in the upper panel of Fig. 5. The optimized results are obtained using a soil thermal diffusivity, $\kappa$ , of $K = 0 . 3 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \mathrm { { m } } ^ { 2 } \mathrm { { s } } ^ { - 1 }$ . Next, the observations of the measured soil heat flux and the calculated soil heat flux (Eq. (4)) can be optimized by varying the soil heat conductivity, . The observed and calculated soil heat fluxes are displayed in the lower panel of Fig. 5. The optimized results were obtained using a heat conductivity of $\lambda { = } 1 . 1 \mathrm { W } \mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ . The annual mean course of the soil heat flux at the surface ${ \mathit { Z } } = 0 . 0 0 \mathrm { m } { \mathrm { , } }$ was calculated as well and plotted in the lower panel of Fig. 5. From the model calculations, the soil heat flux at the surface in the spring is somewhat larger than at $z = 0 . 0 7 5 \mathrm { m }$ depth, while in the fall the opposite occurs. This result must be expected since in spring the soil warms up while during the fall the soil cools down.

With a value found for the soil thermal diffusivity, $\kappa$ , the annual mean damping depth for the annual cycle, $D _ { y } = \sqrt { 2 \kappa / \omega _ { y } }$ , can be calculated, where $\omega _ { y }$ is the annual angular frequency. Here we find the numerical value $D _ { y } = 1 . 8 0 \mathrm { m }$ , a value that is typical for a clay soil (De Vries, 1975; Monteith and Unsworth, 1990). In addition, an estimate can be made for the mean daily damping depth, $D _ { d }$ . This results in the numerical value Dd = √D3y65 $\begin{array} { r } { D _ { d } = \frac { D _ { y } } { \sqrt { 3 6 5 } } = 0 . 1 0 \mathrm { { m } } } \end{array}$ .

Soil moisture content was assumed constant however soil heat capacity and thermal conductivity are a function of soil water content. The first one has a linear dependence and the second one is most sensitive in the drier region (0–0.2 volumetric moisture content). Within the moisture range from half saturation to saturation both follow a similar dependence and therefore the effect on calculated thermal diffusivity and damping depth is limited. The effect on thermal conductivity and thus on soil heat flux calculations is larger (estimated $2 0 \%$ , but limited because the drier soil moisture region is very rare. This estimation is based on recent observations of soil moisture content measurements which were introduced in 2005. The soil moisture content is measured at 0.05, 0.10, 0.30 and $0 . 6 0 \mathrm { m }$ soil depths with a TDR (Time Domain Reflectrometry) system. These measurements show that the upper $5 \mathrm { c m }$ soil layer very rarely dries out below 0.2 volumetric moisture content.

# 4. A biological application

It is interesting and important to assess the biological implications of a significant increase in soil temperatures. Soil temperatures affect numerous ecosystem processes including the dynamics of soil organisms, plant root growth, seed germination, nutrient uptake and decomposition. Below, we provide an example in agriculture.

Soil nematodes start to develop when the soil temperature exceeds a certain limiting value, the so-called base temperature (Campbell and Norman, 1998). For the aggressive but heat-loving root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne enterolobii) this base temperature is $1 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ (Zijlstra et al., 2004). Above this base temperature, the nematode needs a temperature sum of about 600 degree-day to complete its life cycle (Zijlstra et al., 2004). The temperature sum, also called the thermal time (Monteith, 1977), is the total of the daily soil temperature values that occur above the base temperature (Campbell and Norman, 1998).

During the experimental period, the date of year (DOY) number was plotted for two depths, $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m }$ and $0 . 2 0 \mathrm { m }$ (top panel Fig. 6), when the sum of 600 degree-day was reached $( D _ { 6 0 0 } )$ . Moreover, the linear trends and correlation coefficients are provided for both depths. For $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m }$ depth, the correlation is $D _ { 6 0 0 } = - 0 . 6 0 Y + 1 3 9 4$ $\scriptstyle ( r ^ { 2 } = 0 . 3 5 )$ and for $0 . 2 0 \mathrm { m }$ depth $D _ { 6 0 0 } = - 0 . 7 9 Y + 1 7 8 2$ $\scriptstyle ( r ^ { 2 } = 0 . 4 3 )$ . The ANOVA regression statistics (trend $= - 0 . 6 0 \pm 0 . 1 7$ , $p$ -value $= 1 . 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 3 }$ for the $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m }$ depth and $- 0 . 7 9 \pm 0 . 1 8$ , $2 . 0 \times 1 0 ^ { - 4 }$ for the $0 . 1 0 \mathrm { m }$ level, respectively) show that these trends are significant. Fig. 6 shows that for the entire measurement period (1983–2009), the 600 degree-day were reached 16 days earlier at $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m }$ depth and 21 days earlier at $0 . 2 0 \mathrm { m }$ depth. This means that the potential damage from these nematodes can occur earlier in the season and be more intense.

Superimposed on this impact is that these nematodes can have more life-cyles during a growing season and thus add to agricultural losses.

A decrease in the time required to accumulate 600 degree-day means that the mean soil temperature in spring should show a positive trend during the measurement period. This is indeed the case as seen in the bottom panel of Fig. 6.

# 5. Conclusions

For 27 years soil temperatures in a grassland area were measured at five depths (0.05, 0.10, 0.20, 0.50 and $1 . 0 0 \mathrm { m } \mathrm { \dot { \Omega } }$ ) and soil heat flux at $0 . 0 7 5 \mathrm { m }$ depth at one spot in the meteorological observatory of Wageningen University. After analyzing the data series, we found that:

1. A significant trend was found at all five temperature depths, with an annual mean value of $T _ { s . m } = 0 . 0 4 4 Y + 1 0 . 7$ $\stackrel { \cdot } { r ^ { 2 } } = 0 . 2 5 \stackrel { \cdot } { _ { . } }$ ). This is a mean temperature increase of about $1 . 0 ^ { \circ } \mathsf { C }$ during the gapless measurement period from 1987 to 2009, which is large but is consistent with an increase in the annual mean air temperature. This positive trend correlates well with global brightening of $5 . 3 \mathsf { W } \mathsf { m } ^ { - 2 }$ per decade.

2. The annual mean distributions of soil temperatures show a smooth course, with a relatively small variance. The deeper the soil measurements, the smoother this course and the smaller the variance. The variances in February and in November–December were relatively large. The weather during these periods is either cold or warm, which probably is the reason for these larger variances.   
3. The annual mean soil temperature profile is more or less constant with depth, although with a relatively large variance. The variance decreases somewhat with depth. This indicates that large mean soil temperature differences can occur between years. The mean maximum and minimum soil temperature profiles show a clear decrease with depth for the mean maximum profile and a clear increase with depth for the minimum profile. In addition, both profiles have large variances, which also decrease with depth.   
4. A FFT-analysis of the distribution of soil temperatures and soil heat flux revealed a mean soil diffusivity of $\mathrm { ' } \kappa = 0 . 3 2 \times 1 0 ^ { - 6 } \mathrm { { m } } ^ { 2 } \ s ^ { - 1 }$ and a mean soil heat conductivity of $\lambda { = } 1 . 1 \mathrm { W } \mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 } \mathrm { K } ^ { - 1 }$ . This results in an annual mean damping depth of $D _ { y } = 1 . 8 0 \mathrm { m }$ and a mean daily damping depth of $D _ { d } = 0 . 1 0 \mathrm { m }$ . These results agree more or less with the damping depth expected for a clay soil.   
5. The soil temperature results were applied to the life-cycle of the root-knot nematode (M. enterolobii). This heat-loving but aggressive nematode has a base temperature of $1 0 ^ { \circ } { \mathsf { C } }$ and has a biological life-cycle of 600 degree-day. The analysis reveals that for the 27-year measurement period, the mean life-cycle of 600 degree-day threshold was reached 16 days earlier at $0 . 0 5 \mathrm { m }$ depth and 21 days earlier at $0 . 2 0 \mathrm { m }$ depth.
