The paper provides strategies for implementing PCMs and outlines an operation strategy for achieving near- zero energy consumption in solar greenhouses during winter. The ANN algorithm demonstrated promising results for predicting internal greenhouse parameters. Overall, this study contributes to the advancement of thermal energy storage systems and their potential applications in sustainable agriculture.

# 1. Introduction

Greenhouses are designed to provide a protected environment for crop growth, allowing for the creation of favorable growing conditions despite climatic adversity. However, the energy transfer between the interior and exterior of greenhouses necessitates the regulation of temperature, ventilation, and other environmental factors to ensure optimal growing conditions and prevent crop damage [1]. Heat can be generated in a greenhouse utilizing a variety of technologies and energy sources, Guarino et al. [2], examined the application of phase change material (PCM) as a thermal storage solution for passive solar heating in cold climates. The study focused on a solaria, where PCM was installed on the inner layer of walls. The research found that the PCM thermal storage was effective in storing heat during the day and releasing it at night, leading to a significant increase in the temperature of the solaria. The average air temperature of the solaria was observed to increase by  $5 - 7^{\circ}C$  during the day and  $3 - 5^{\circ}C$  at night when using PCM storage. Furthermore, the use of PCM thermal storage increased the overall solar energy gain of the solaria by up to  $50\%$  . These findings suggest that PCM thermal storage can be a promising solution for passive solar heating in buildings, particularly in cold climates. Heating, which is a significant cost in greenhouses, is commonly supplied by burning various fuels, including fossil fuels [1]. The rising concerns regarding energy security and the adverse environmental impact of fossil fuels explicitly concerning climate change, underscore the significance of utilizing renewable energy sources. Solar greenhouses, which rely primarily on solar energy for heating, are gaining broader application in overwintering crops in dry regions of southern Algeria. Phase Change Materials (PCMs) offer a promising avenue for Thermal Energy Storage (TES) systems due to their potential to address various engineering systems, including

building applications, greenhouses, solar energy, and cogeneration [3].

The literature contains a thorough examination of these applications [4,5]. PCMs are used in water tanks [6,7] air conditions [8,9], heat pumps [10] are a few of the particular purposes of PCMs in greenhouses. A number of studies have demonstrated that using phase change material (PCM) in the northern wall of solar greenhouses effectively enhances the indoor thermal environment. PCM is capable of storing solar radiation during the daytime and releasing it for up to  $8\mathrm{h}$  after sunset, thereby contributing to the greenhouse's thermal performance [11]. Berroug et al. [12], conducted a simulation study to evaluate the effectiveness of CaCl2- 6H2O as a phase change material (PCM) on the north- facing wall of solar greenhouses. The results of their investigation revealed that the incorporation of PCM in the north wall led to a significant increase in the thermal storage capacity of the system, resulting in an indoor temperature rise of  $6 - 12^{\circ}C$

On the other hand, Najjar and Hasan [13], aimed to reduce temperature fluctuations inside a greenhouse by utilizing phase change material (PCM) energy storage. They developed a mathematical model for both the PCM storage and the greenhouse, and using their simulations, they found that PCM storage reduced temperature swings by  $3 - 5^{\circ}C$  over a  $24\mathrm{h}$  . The authors recommended improving the heat transfer between the PCM storage and the air inside the greenhouse to enhance further the system's effectiveness in regulating temperature. Overall, their research highlights the potential of PCM energy storage to improve greenhouse performance and create a more stable environment for plant growth. Guan et al. [14], also suggested that in a  $900\mathrm{mm}$  thick wall composed of three layers of phase change material (PCM), only the  $300~\mathrm{mm}$  thick section influenced by solar gains was effective. In solar greenhouses, an active strategy is required to increase the temperature of the middle layer and improve the heat storage capacity of the northfacing walls. Previous research has explored the effectiveness of this approach in improving building performance. The experimental wall consisted of a thermal- stable layer with a thickness of  $750~\mathrm{mm}$  [15,16], Fang et al. [17], designed a water barrier system on the internal surface of the back wall to absorb solar radiation. At night, this system employing water cycled from the water tank could boost the indoor temperature by  $5.4^{\circ}C$  and the temperature of the crops' rhizosphere by  $1.6^{\circ}C$  An active- passive ventilation wall with latent heat storage was developed to improve the solar energy usage ratio in winter. Guohong and David [18], investigated the use of CFD software to analyze the fluctuation of the temperature field with the thickness of composite walls used in solar greenhouses. When the wall thickness was  $0.60\mathrm{m}$  the results showed that the thinner the heat storage layer, the faster the internal temperature declined. Nguyen and Wells [19], developed a solar chimney with a horizontal absorber surface. The data shows that this system was  $65.2\%$  more efficient than the ordinary Trombe system. PCM thermophysical characteristics and concrete heat capacity, fluctuate substantially with temperature. The thermophysical properties of photovoltaic cells (PCMs) fluctuate dramatically with temperature, and their attributes are investigated experimentally. However, the numerical model cannot accommodate discontinuous test findings. To summarize the primary thermal Energy Storage systems used in greenhouses are sensible Thermal Energy Storage using rock beds [20], water reservoirs [21,22], and latent Thermal Energy Storage using phase change materials (PCMs) [23,24]. Renewable- powered greenhouses with Thermal Energy Storage have a more manageable indoor temperature, higher crop yield, extended harvests, and energy savings [25,26]. During the phase transition, PCMs store and release significant thermal energy at a nearly constant temperature [27,28]. Solid- gas, liquid- gas, and solidliquid phase transitions are the most common [29]. PCMs with solidliquid transitions, on the other hand, offer a wide range of temperatures suitable for various applications, lower volume changes during the transition, and higher storage densities [30,31]. Salt hydrates, paraffin wax, fatty acids, and eutectics are the most commonly used PCMs [32].

The primary objective of our research is to adapt the utilization of phase change materials (PCMs) for temperature control in a greenhouse substrate heating system. Our proposed system incorporates passive thermal energy storage units that effectively capture and store excess heat during daylight hours through PCM melting. During nighttime, when heat is required to maintain optimal root zone temperatures, the PCM solidifies, subsequently releasing the stored heat. This study encompasses the following specific goals: (1) designing and constructing an innovative thermal energy storage unit utilizing calcium chloride hexahydrate (CaCl2- 6H2O) as the PCM, which exhibits a melting temperature range of  $26 - 29^{\circ}C$  and a latent heat of melting measuring 170  $\mathrm{kJ / kg}$  for efficient solar energy storage in greenhouse heating; (2) enhancing the effectiveness of solar energy in greenhouse heating; (3) evaluating the feasibility of PCMs as a viable alternative to existing solar thermal energy storage solutions in semi- arid regions; and (4) integrating artificial intelligence techniques to accurately predict the internal air temperature of the greenhouse. To validate our research, we present the outcomes of our field testing conducted in a greenhouse located in the Ghardaia region of Algeria.

# 2.Material

# 2.1. Experimental setup

A prototype single tunnel greenhouse with a  $1 / 10$  scale in Ghardaia Province in southern Algeria was chosen for field measurements to explore the internal thermal environment of plastic greenhouses see Fig. 1. In winter, the mean temperature in Ghardaia's coldest month is  $20^{\circ}C_{i}$  with an extreme temperature of  $0^{\circ}\mathbb{C}$  [33].

Temperatures in various areas throughout the plastic greenhouse and the ground surface temperature, were measured using twelve calibrated K- type thermocouples and a DHT22 temperature sensor (with a 2  $\%$  accuracy). Fig. 1 depicts the measurement configurations. All of the data was recorded using a microprocessor (ATmega Arduino). Furthermore, at Ghardaia, Algeria, a Wireless Weather Station with Touch WS2- 550 was built to capture weather data such as temperature, humidity, sun radiation, and wind speed. The station has a 10- min precision and a temperature accuracy of  $0.005^{\circ}C$  . The inside heat environment changes of the plastic greenhouse were experimentally investigated on January 20, 2021, utilizing a 10- minute test interval.

# 2.2. Reason of choice CaCl2-6H2O as storage materials?

This study investigated CaCl2- 6H2O as a potential thermal energy storage material for greenhouse heating. It found that CaCl2- 6H2O possesses desirable thermal characteristics, such as a phase change temperature of approximately  $29^{\circ}C_{i}$  high latent heat of fusion of around  $246\mathrm{kJ / kg}$  and a specific heat capacity of  $200\mathrm{J / kg\cdot K}$  at  $25^{\circ}C$  [34- 37]. It also demonstrated a high thermal conductivity and density compared to other phase change materials [38]. The thermal stability of CaCl2- 6H2O was evaluated, and its cost, abundance, and environmental impact were considered [39]. Overall, CaCl2- 6H2O shows promise as a thermal energy storage material due to its properties, making it suitable for various applications, including greenhouse heating.

Regarding disposal in the agricultural field, several scenarios were discussed. CaCl2- 6H2O can be gradually diluted and incorporated into the soil for soil amendment or pH adjustment. If minimally contaminated, it can be filtered, treated, and reused. Solid waste disposal and neutralization with subsequent disposal were suggested for heavily contaminated CaCl2- 6H2O [40,41]. Education and awareness about responsible use and disposal practices are crucial. Proper disposal should adhere to local regulations and best practices to minimize environmental impacts. Consulting experts and authorities are recommended for specific disposal methods.

Fig. 1. Experimental setup.

(CaCl2- 6H2O) was chosen for its thermal qualities suitable for the greenhouse's climatic environment. We created a storage unit of 40 aluminum soda cans filled with  $18\mathrm{kg}$  of calcium chloride for this experiment. The cans have a diameter of  $6\mathrm{cm}$  and a height of  $12\mathrm{cm}$ . Each packet of calcium chloride weighs  $0.45\mathrm{kg}$ . To absorb the most significant solar radiation, we painted each can black and placed it on a support with a  $30^{\circ}$  inclination to the south, as shown in Fig. 1.

# 2.4. Theoretical analysis

# 2.4.1. Nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) network

Greenhouses are incredibly complex, nonlinear living systems that alter behavior over time in reaction to numerous shocks, the majority of which are weather- related, as depicted in the Fig. 2. Because of their universal approximation capabilities, artificial neural networks are gaining popularity as a generic solution for dealing with nonlinear system issues [42]. On the other hand, specific neural network topologies are required for optimal issue- solving. As a result, several versions of artificial neural network architecture have been developed in recent years. For dynamic system identification, a nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) network [43], is considered for dynamic system identification. NARX networks are a sort of artificial neural network with an output feedback method that can recognize any nonlinear dynamic system. NARX networks are employed in a wide range of dynamic system applications. NARX networks were also better at anticipating long- term dependencies [44].

Fig. 2. Greenhouse system model.

In terms of effectiveness, dynamic networks outperform stationary networks, but they are more challenging to train due to their requirement to discard memory and learn sequences or time- varying patterns. To evaluate the performance of constant greenhouse climate projections, a NARX model with these properties was utilized. The network was trained using an improved Levenberg- Marquardt algorithm with Bayesian regularization, which computes updated weights based on the association. The NARX model's input information was identical to that of the ANN model, and its concealed layer was composed of two layers (Fig. 3). Each active function was configured to enable direct comparison of performance between the Tamm and ReLu ANN models. The model's performance was evaluated quickly by comparing it to the performance of the NARX model's time delay layer. The NARX model was created using Matlab R2020a. The foundation of the NARX model is the linear ARX model, which is commonly used in time- series modeling and defined by the following function:

$$
\begin{array}{rl} & T(t) + a_1T(t - 1) + \ldots +a_{na}T(t - na) = b_1u(t - nk) + \ldots \\ & \qquad +b_{nb}u(t - nb - nk + 1) + e(t) \end{array}
$$

# 2.5. Evaluation metrics

Two metrics are discussed throughout the NARX approach's prediction outcomes evaluation stage. The coefficient of determination is denoted by  $(\mathbb{R}^2)$ . This metric measures how accurately a model predicts a set of measured data.  $(\mathbb{R}^2)$  has a value between 0 and 1. When the  $(\mathbb{R}^2)$  value approaches one, it indicates that performance has improved [45,46]. Additional criterion Relative roots (RMSE) represent the squared error. The algorithms success for this measurement is accepted as follows: (Excellent:  $\mathrm{RMSE} > 10\%$ , Good:  $\mathrm{RMSE} > 20\%$ , Fair:  $\mathrm{RMSE} > 30\%$ , Poor:  $\mathrm{RMSE} > 30\%$ ) [47- 49].

$$
RMSE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}(Tobs i - Tpridecti)}
$$

where n represents the total number of datasets used for estimation; Tobsi is the actual temperature (observed output); Tpridecti is the predicted temperature (estimated output), and Tm is the mean value of the prediction set's observed output.

# 3. Result and discussion

# 3.1. Experimental assessment

The thermal storage and release achievement of PCMs and the indoor air temperatures of a plastic greenhouse with and without PCMs were investigated and compared.

The Fig. 4 illustrates the temperatures within two types of plastic greenhouses, one with and one without PCM. These observations were recorded between January 1, 2021, and March 13, 2021, when temperatures in Algeria's Ghardai region were at their lowest (Fig. 4). According to the trial results, the indoor air temperature dropped to its lowest point after midnight. PCMs can lessen interior temperature swings by decreasing daytime and nighttime indoor temperatures. The internal temperature variation range of the plastic greenhouse with PCMs was  $8^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  greater than the indoor temperature variation range of the plastic greenhouse without PCMs. As a result, the PCMs considerably improved the thermal environment near the ground as shown in Fig. 5. Without PCMs, the greenhouse could not keep the inside air temperature over  $10^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$  at night. The results are consistent with the References [17, 50, 51].

# 3.2. Prediction assessment

This research paper demonstrates the effectiveness of NARX (Nonlinear AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs) models in analyzing the factors influencing air temperature inside a greenhouse and predicting its future values. The NARX model incorporates external factors like temperature, humidity, solar irradiation, and wind velocity as exogenous inputs to capture their relationships with air temperature as shown in Fig. 6. Through training the NARX model with a historical dataset of greenhouse temperature measurements and exogenous inputs, it learns the nonlinear relationships between the inputs and outputs. This acquired knowledge enables the model to accurately forecast future air temperature values based on past and present input values. The paper suggests that incorporating various types of inputs, such as time- lagged variables or variables capturing seasonal trends, can further enhance the accuracy of NARX models. To evaluate the model's performance, a comparison is made between the simulated air temperature values predicted by the NARX model and the actual measured values from January 1, 2021, to March 13, 2021. Fig. 7 in the paper presents this comparison, illustrating how closely the NARX model approximates the actual temperature values. Table 1 provides Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) as a metric to measure the accuracy of the NARX model's predictions in modeling the internal temperature of the greenhouse. RMSE is a widely used measure for quantifying the average deviation between predicted and actual values. The reported RMSE values in the table (e.g.,  $1.74\% - 5.81\% , 1.40\% - 3.20\% ,$  and  $0.992 - 0.996$ ) indicate the accuracy of the NARX model's predictions across different periods or scenarios. The study's results demonstrate the NARX model's effectiveness in modeling the internal temperature of a greenhouse. The low RMSE values suggest that the model's predictions closely align with the actual measurements, indicating the potential usefulness of NARX models in practical greenhouse projects for predicting the thermal performance of greenhouses. The inclusion of another study supporting the potential of NARX models further strengthens the conclusions drawn from this research. It implies that multiple studies have observed positive outcomes with NARX models in predicting the thermal performance of greenhouses. This collective evidence bolsters the claim that NARX models can serve as valuable tools in practical projects related to greenhouse temperature prediction [3,47,52,53].

# 4. Conclusion and perspectives

Integrating phase change materials (PCM) under the roof of greenhouses as a form of shading has been proposed as an effective method for improving the thermal performances inside the greenhouse. This is due to PCM's high heat storage density and the fact that it is essentially isothermal during the charging and discharging processes.

The following conclusions can be obtained from the experimental and forecast results:

- PCM used in the proposed approach can raise the temperature, with a temperature rise of \(1 
- 8^{\circ}C\) at night.- The proposed method improves the daily effective accumulative temperature of ambient air by \(11 
- 43\%\) on average.- Scaling up the use of PCM thermal energy storage units in larger or commercial settings may present challenges such as the initial cost of implementation and maintenance, as well as the need for more complex control systems. However, the potential benefits of reduced energy costs and increased crop yields could make it a viable option for sustainable greenhouse production.- NARX models can forecast the air temperature inside a greenhouse, showing high performance.- NARX models can be a useful tool for predicting air temperature inside a greenhouse. The model can be trained on historical data and can be used to make predictions based on the current and past values of relevant exogenous inputs. To improve the accuracy of the predictions, it's important to consider multiple inputs that capture different aspects of the greenhouse environment.

- In future studies, we could consider replicating the experiments in different regions with varying climates to improve the generalizability of the results. Additionally, we could modify the experimental setup to incorporate variables such as wind speed, solar radiation, and cloud cover to better simulate real-world greenhouse conditions.- Other machine learning algorithms or modeling techniques, such as support vector regression or random forest regression, could be used to predict temperature changes within the greenhouse. However, these techniques would need to be evaluated for their accuracy and efficiency in comparison to the ANN-NARX model used in this study.- The performance of the PCM thermal energy storage unit may vary under different weather conditions, and future studies could investigate the system's performance under extreme temperatures or humidity levels.- Further modifications to the experimental design are recommended to investigate the economic benefits and drawbacks of using PCM thermal energy storage units in greenhouses. This includes analyzing the impact of reduced energy costs on overall profitability and evaluating the influence of increased crop yields on revenue. These
